				<h3>The Basics</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Results screens displayed after you clear a mission consist of six bonuses, and the points you earn become Experience Points. While it’s possible to get a rough idea of how the bonus points work just from the names, here is a detailed explanation of how the numbers are calculated.<br />
<img alt="test024.jpg" src="../../images/test024.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><img alt="test025.jpg" src="../../images/test025.jpg" width="260" height="195" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">Action Bonus</strong><br />
Number of Pearls collected		Number of Pearls collected x 1p<br />
Time Break				30p when used for 3 seconds<br />
					Add 10p × times used for each second thereafter<br />
Speed Break				Distance used at one time + 10p × times used<br />
Grinding				Distance (1/2) + 10p × times used<br />
Grind Tricks				Times used × 20p</p>

<p>The Grinding-related Action Bonuses are a little complicated. You can earn points by grinding a set distance, and the more often you grind at least that distance, the more points you earn. If you stop grinding before you reach the set distance, you will not earn any points.<br />
For Grind Tricks, simply performing a trick is not enough. You must perform a trick and land on another grind in order to earn points.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">Enemy Bonus</strong><br />
Number of enemies defeated		Number defeated × 50p</p>

<p>This is calculated using the number of enemies defeated, regardless of the type of enemy. You can also receive set bonuses for defeating certain bosses.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">Ring Bonus</strong><br />
Number of Rings collected		Number of Rings × 3p</p>

<p>The Rings you collect during a mission are converted to Experience Points. The number of Rings you lose by taking damage or being defeated doesn’t matter—the calculation is based simply of the number of Rings you collect.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">Technical Bonus</strong><br />
Undefeated: no damage		× 2.0<br />
Undefeated: took damage once	× 1.5<br />
Undefeated: took damage 2-3 times	× 1.2<br />
Undefeated: took damage 4-5 times	× 1.1<br />
Took damage 6 or more times	× 1.0<br />
Defeated				× 1.0<br />
Mission failed				× 0.3</p>

<p>The Technical Bonus multiplier is calculated based on the number of times you took damage during the mission. Your total points from the Action Bonus, Enemy Bonus and Ring Bonus are multiplied by the Technical Bonus, so even if you let some Rings, Pearls or enemies get away, clearing the mission without taking any damage will get you a lot of Experience Points.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<img alt="test026.jpg" src="../../images/test026.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
<strong class="txt-large">Mission Bonus</strong><br />
The Mission Bonus is a set amount of bonus points you receive when you clear a mission for the first time. You receive more points for longer missions, and fewer points for short ones. Once you clear a mission and receive a Mission Bonus, you won’t receive a bonus even if you clear it again.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">Experience Bonus</strong><br />
EXP Bonus earned during mission	Experience Bonus earned during the mission<br />
Fire Soul				Number of Fire Souls collected in mission × 500p</p>

<p>Experience Points earned during the mission using skills such as Cancel Absorber and Expert Drift, along with 500p for each Fire Soul you collected, will be added to the total.</p>

<p>Use this information to better understand the results, and take advantage of it to maximize your Experience Points!</p>
