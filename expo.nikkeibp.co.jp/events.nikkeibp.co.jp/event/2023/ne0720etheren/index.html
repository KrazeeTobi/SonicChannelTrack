<p>
  The Age of Software Definition in vehicles and automotive networks is here. The industry’s evolution toward Software Defined Vehicles (SDV) is accelerating, promising new driving experiences through the installation and upgrade of onboard software, just like smartphones. Simultaneously, Software Defined Networking (SDN), capable of dynamically adjusting network configuration and function through software, is also finding wider application.
</p>
<p>
  Tesla of the US was the pioneer, but other companies are ramping up full-scale implementations as well, including major automobile manufacturers such as Volkswagen of Germany and Toyota of Japan, and a number of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. 
</p>
<p>
  One of the key constituent technologies in both SDV and SDN is automotive Ethernet, which offers much better speed, capacity, and affinity with existing information technology (IT) than conventional automotive local area networks (LAN) can deliver. Major European automotive manufacturers were the first to adopt the technology, with Japanese industry leaders including Toyota and Nissan following close behind.
</p>
<p>
  New EV manufacturers are also rapidly adopting the tech. Sony Honda Mobility of Japan, for example, uses automotive Ethernet in its new AFEELA brand.
</p>
<p>
  This event brings together experts from around the world—automotive manufacturing, parts makers, and more—to discuss and explain automotive Ethernet and the impact it is having on automobiles, as well as trends in next-gen automotive networks.
</p>
<p>
  We hope you’ll join us there.

                Even after the SDV is supplied on the market, the vehicle evolves due to additions and changes in the software. Therefore, an innovative in-vehicle architecture with flexibility is necessary to add or change functions through software, allowing the in-vehicle network to realize functional additions and changes. JASPAR is studying applying the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) concept to in-vehicle networks and defines this as automotive SDN. SDN is a system that can dynamically update network configuration in the ICT field. For SDV, this presentation proposes a new in-vehicle architecture to realize a network that applies automotive SDN. Specifically, we define the minimum requirements for in-vehicle SDN based on use cases and define the prerequisites for an in-vehicle network, proposing a reasonable logical and physical architecture from the viewpoint of these constraints.

                With the spread of in-vehicle Ethernet, IEEE and multiple organizations, such as AUTOSAR, OPEN Alliance, and AVnu Alliance, have started developing standards. Unfortunately, the conflicts that cause various harmful effects can naturally arise among multiple standards. Against this background, this presentation introduces some conflicts between standards and examples of JASPAR’s effort to solve them. Finally, the presenters want to call on the audience to ensure that various standards cooperate.

At BMW she is responsible for the strategy for the in-vehicle networking technologies. This entails ensuring the availability of suitable in-vehicle networking technologies well before application engineers want to use them. In this context she successfully introduced Ethernet as a networking technology into the automotive industry. In her opinion, only open standards provide the basis for long term sustainability of networking technologies. She and her former colleague Thomas Königseder describe their experiences, background and technical concepts behind the use of Ethernet in the automotive industry in a book titled “Automotive Ethernet”. Her new book, co-authored by her colleague Michael Kaindl, “Automotive High Speed Communication Technologies, SerDes and Ethernet for Sensor and Display Applications”, appeared in Autumn 2022.</p>

                In 2023, BMW is looking back on 15 years of experience with Ethernet in series production cars. During this time, BMW has continuously extended the number of Ethernet nodes as well as the functionality of the Ethernet network in its cars. This refers to supported data rates as well as to supported networking capabilities (security, diagnostics, …). Looking forward, BMW intends to further extend its in-vehicle Ethernet network. This presentation elaborates on the architecture induced changes (“zonal”) and the challenges and solutions this offers. The extension to lower data rates (10BASE-T1S) as well as higher data rates (MGBASE-T1 as well as ASA-ML) each have different implications that will be discussed in detail.

                This presentation introduces the method/concept of supporting the functional safety standard (ISO 26262) in In-vehicle Ethernet. In-vehicle Ethernet is expected to be used more widely in the future. On the other hand, due to the complex protocol structure and the use of OSS (Open-Source Software), it is difficult to take conventional functional safety measures (functional safety measures are implemented for all communication elements). In this presentation, we will introduce functional safety measures that incorporate the concept of black channel, which can also be applied to In-vehicle Ethernet.

                With cars of the future moving towards software-defined vehicles demanding a more common and scalable architecture, the current distributed network architecture has reached the limit of its capabilities. Focus has moved to zonal controller architecture to simplify network design, reduce weight and cost yet maximize performance. This session explores these challenges that new interfaces such as Automotive Ethernet poses and provides insight into the tools to verify and debug high-speed digital links.

                The development of autonomous driving technologies and SDVs is accelerating, and there is a need for faster, real-time communication. As a result, the range of applications for automotivee Ethernet has expanded, and communication speeds have evolved from 100Mbps to 1Gbps and then to multi-gigabit. However, in order to accommodate such high-speed communications, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) design increases in difficulty in terms of SI(Signal Integrity)/PI(Power Integrity)/EMC(Electro-magnetic Compatibility). In this presentation, ECU hardware design and EMC performances for multi-gigabit Ethernet are explained.

                As stated in the purpose of this event, SDV is transforming in-vehicle systems into software-centric systems.<br>
                Software-centric systems require faster development speed and continuous development.<br>
                Therefore, development evaluation methods for in-vehicle systems are also changing.<br>
                In this presentation, we will introduce Vector solution for the evaluation of in-vehicle Ethernet communication in both virtual and real environments.
