This year will see transitions with a vigor that will exceed even that of last year. The reason for this is that games have now permeated the lives of women, seniors, and other people who have not played games before, to say nothing of hard-core games fans, and the great variety of game software that continues to be released is evidence of this. It can be thought that the proactive approach to business development in the game industry in light of this social trend is linked to the expansion of the scale of the Tokyo Game Show.</td>
