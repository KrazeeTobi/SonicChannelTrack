														Multiplayer casual games are increasingly being bought by mobile users, and we'll go through how Nokia is developing SNAP Mobile to address the masses in this area.  <br />
														Historically, mobile games have often been treated separately for the Eastern and Western markets, however there is huge potential in tapping into the global market, especially as more and more online communities with no geographical boundaries gain in popularity. We'll go through an actual case study of a promising Japanese publisher that managed to break through the Western barriers, and is launching a connected casual mobile game in North America. </p>
