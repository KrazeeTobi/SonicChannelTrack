                <h3><span>1</span>What's your background in making games?</h3>
                <p>I made small games throughout college when I was learning how to program. After I graduated, I went to a grad program at Entertainment Technology Center at CMU to make some more games. And I've just recently graduated.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>2</span>How much time did you spend working on the game?</h3>
                <p>I started with the first idea and prototype of the game in 2012 November. It began as a short 2-week project for a college course. I've been working on it on and off since, but in total I might have spent a year or so working on the game while in school. It feels like I've just started though.</p>

            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>3</span>How did you come up with the concept?</h3>
                <p>I came up with the concept when I was trying to sleep. I was trying to come up with an idea that I could implement in 2 weeks and still be interesting. Since I couldn't do art, I knew the game would probably involve objects as simple as a white cube. How do I move plain white cubes around in an interesting way? I thought of a few ways by changing velocity, but it was all too complicated. Then I had the thought, "why don't you just put it down?" It didn't make any sense, so I started thinking about it some more and came up with the concept. And then I went to sleep.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>4</span>What development tools did you use?</h3>
                <p>I'm using Unity and other miscellaneous media tools like Photoshop and Maya.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>5</span>What were the significant changes from the "old buggy prototype"<br /> you made a year ago?</h3>
                <p>It's significantly less buggy now! There was a big prototyping phase that went on for a while, and a bunch of weird ideas got implemented. At the moment, I'm trying to build more puzzles and build out the world.</p>

                <h3><span>6</span>Have you sold or released the game of your presentation? How did it go?<br /> Let us know what it has gone since then.</h3>
                <p>The game isn't released yet (and still a few years away), but since Sense of Wonder Night I've shown it at a few places including IGF Student Showcase, GDC's Experimental Gameplay Workshop, The MIX at SIGGRAPH, and IndieCade.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>7</span>What is your goal as a game developer?</h3>
                <p>My goal is to make game experiences that are unique that I would enjoy. And I also want to make sure I grow and be better as a game developer. I think any game developer able to fulfill those goals - and have enough to eat - are quite lucky.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>8</span>Please send a message to game developers who is joining SOWN<br /> with his game!</h3>
                <p>SOWN was the first time I showed my game to a lot of people, but the experience gave me confidence to carry the concept on further. For the first time, I felt that I could make it as a game developer. I think SOWN is a great opportunity for game developers who have a cool concept or a slice of game and are just starting out. A lot of great games debuted at SOWN, including Antichamber, Unfinished Swan, and Memory of a Broken Dimension.</p>

                        <p>The game "Kyoto" was a homage to the beautiful city that I've lived in. When I first moved there, I was so in awe of the beauty and majesty of the city that I wanted to pay homage to it in the only way I knew how -- which was to make a interactive game experience out of it!</p>

                        <p>I had the idea for a hyper-dimensional game in college, maybe around 2005? When you program a 3D game, every object’s position is represented using three numbers (usually called x, y and z), but that concept easily generalizes.</p>

                        <p>Ultima Online was the first MMO I played when I grew up.  It was very impressive to see so many players all across the world play the same game!  I wanted to be able to build the world together with my friends.  I began building early builds of a game that allowed multiple people to build in the world together.  It was very basic, but even early on it was fun to build together.</p>

                        <p>I frequently played video games with my friends and family. In that setting, the question that was always in the back of my mind was whether there was a game that more people could enjoy playing together.</p>
