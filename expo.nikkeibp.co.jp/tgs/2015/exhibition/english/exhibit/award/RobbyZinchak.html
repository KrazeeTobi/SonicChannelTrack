                <h3><span>1</span>What's your background in making games?</h3>
                <p>I made my first game when I was ten years old using the programming language 'BASIC'.  I began learning more programming and made many more small games.  Over the years, my games got bigger and better.  I went to college and got a degree in computer science.  After finishing college, I entered the professional game industry in 2006.  I worked at Midway, Capcom, and Microsoft and got to work on some great projects.  I had always wanted to work on my own project though, so in 2011 I became a full time indie developer.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>2</span>How much time did you spend working on the game?</h3>
                <p>I worked on 8BitMMO for around fourteen years (but only full-time for three years).</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>3</span>How did you come up with the concept?</h3>
                <p>Ultima Online was the first MMO I played when I grew up.  It was very impressive to see so many players all across the world play the same game!  I wanted to be able to build the world together with my friends.  I began building early builds of a game that allowed multiple people to build in the world together.  It was very basic, but even early on it was fun to build together.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>4</span>What development tools did you use?</h3>
                <p>For this project, I used C++ and Java programming languages.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>5</span>What were the significant changes from the "old buggy prototype"<br /> you made a year ago?</h3>
                <p>There is a whole new Player vs Player mode implemented now called 'Transponders' where players can build bases that other players can try to infiltrate.  Additionally, many new in-game items have been added.</p>

                <h3><span>6</span>Have you sold or released the game of your presentation? How did it go?<br /> Let us know what it has gone since then.</h3>
                <p>Yes, after many years, 8BitMMO is now finally released.  It is now up to more than 750,000 registered players!  I am thankful so many players have found the game interesting.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>7</span>What is your goal as a game developer?</h3>
                <p>I love to be able to follow my vision and make games full-time.  As a studio, I am currently almost profitable with my games, but I still have to do contract work on other projects sometimes to make ends meet.  My dream is to be fully self sufficient so I can spend all my time making my games.  Also while I am dreaming, I would very much love to live in Japan for a year or two.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>8</span>Please send a message to game developers who is joining SOWN<br /> with his game!</h3>
                <p>Congratulations to developers joining SOWN!  It is very exciting to be recognized internationally with this honor.  Getting to visit Japan and win this award was one of the best moments of my life.  I am looking forward to seeing your projects!</p>

                        <p>I came up with the concept when I was trying to sleep. I was trying to come up with an idea that I could implement in 2 weeks and still be interesting. Since I couldn't do art, I knew the game would probably involve objects as simple as a white cube.</p>

                        <p>The game "Kyoto" was a homage to the beautiful city that I've lived in. When I first moved there, I was so in awe of the beauty and majesty of the city that I wanted to pay homage to it in the only way I knew how -- which was to make a interactive game experience out of it!</p>

                        <p>I had the idea for a hyper-dimensional game in college, maybe around 2005? When you program a 3D game, every object’s position is represented using three numbers (usually called x, y and z), but that concept easily generalizes.</p>
