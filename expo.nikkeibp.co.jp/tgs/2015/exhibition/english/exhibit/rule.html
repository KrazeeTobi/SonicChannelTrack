		<li>・For booth decorations and structures, sound volume, exhibit contents/methods, manner of performance with no provisions in the &quot;Exhibitors Manual&quot;, OMO has an authorization to cancel an exhibition, and each exhibitor must follow OMO instructions regardless pre and ongoing exhibition periods.</li>
		<li>・Each exhibitor must ensure that its exhibit does not interfere with those of adjacent exhibitors.

<div class="RuleBox">
	<h3 class="RuleBox_ttl">■Determination of Booth Location</h3>
	<ul class="indent01">
		<li>・The location of booths will be determined at a booth location selection meeting to be held on June 23, 2015, (for exhibitors that applied for 40 booths or more) and June 1, 2015 (for exhibitors that applied for fewer than 40 booths).</li>
		<li>・If the exhibitor will not be able to attend the booth location selection meeting, the exhibitor must entrust the booth location selection to the OMO in advance.</li>

		<li>・Selection methods:<br />- In descending order beginning with exhibitors requesting a larger number of booths, exhibitors will be asked to select desired booth locations from among available booths, prepared by the organizer in advance, based on the number of booths.<br />- The selection order, if there are multiple exhibitors with the same number of booths, will be as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>1. Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show (TOKYO GAME SHOW 2014) and applied for booths before the application deadline.</li>
			<li>2. Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show but applied for booths after the deadline.</li>
			<li>3. Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show but applied for booths before the deadline.</li>
			<li>4. Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show and applied for booths after the deadline.</li>
			<li>5. If there are multiple exhibitors in the above conditions, the member of Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) has priority to select a booth location.</li>
		</ul>
		Further determination in the same conditions will be selected by a lottery.<br />
*Depending on the state of applications, there may be cases in which the selection method will be changed in advance. In that case, the OMO will send notification before the booth location selection meeting.

		<li>・It is not possible to change the number of booths at the booth location selection meeting.</li>
		<li>・If the number of booths cannot be accommodated during the booth location selection meeting, the exhibitor may have to adjust the number of booths requested in consultation with the OMO, or may be asked to change the depth-to-width ratio of the exhibition area, with the applied area being unchanged.</li>
		<li>・The exhibitor cannot change the location of booths after their selection. However, there may be cases in which the location of the exhibitor's booth will be changed, based on the exhibitor's consultation with the OMO, due to a booth cancellation by another exhibitor, the addition of new booths or other reasons.</li>
