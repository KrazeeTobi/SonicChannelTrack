<h2>Now Accepting presentation entries!</h2>

Nikkei Business Publications, Inc.</p>

<img src="sown2009_logo.png" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;">

<p>The Computer Entertainment Supplier&rsquo;s Association (CESA; Chairman: Yoichi Wada; Location: Minato-ku, Tokyo), in cooperation with Nikkei Business Publications, Inc. (Nikkei BP; President & CEO: Yasuo Hirata; Location:　Minato-ku, Tokyo), will hold the TOKYO GAME SHOW 2009 over a four-day period from Thursday, September 24 to Sunday, September 27, 2009 at Makuhari Messe in Mihama-ku, Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture. As in the last year, &ldquo;SENSE OF WONDER NIGHT 2009&rdquo; (SOWN) will be featured during the Show, in cooperation with the International Game Developers Association Japan Chapter (IGDA Japan; Representative: Kiyoshi Shin).</p>

<p>SOWN, first held last year, aims to discover new game ideas that will catch people by surprise and give them a &ldquo;Sense of Wonder&rdquo; &mdash; a sense that something will change in their world &mdash; right at the instant of seeing or hearing the concept. It spotlights motivated game developers by providing them with an opportunity to present their ideas and prototypes. Applications for presentations at SOWN 2009 are now being accepted.</p>

<p>Last year, it received 67 entries from 14 countries and regions. 11 titles were selected for presentation, including 4 from outside Japan. The audience of more than 500 people from 22 countries and regions gathered for the presentations as well as for the concurrently-held International Party. It was a truly international event and ended in a great success.</p>

<p>The SOWN 2009 office began inviting entries to SOWN 2009 on May 27 (Wed.). Entries will be accepted through August 16 (Sun). Innovative ideas are welcomed widely, regardless of the applicant&rsquo;s amateur / professional status and nationality, and from both individuals and corporate bodies.</p>

<p>For more information on SOWN 2009, please refer to the attached outline. You can also find more details at the SOWN 2009 official website (<a target="_parent" href="http://tgs.cesa.or.jp/sown/en/">http://tgs.cesa.or.jp/sown/en/</a>).</p>

<h4>Game Application Guidelines</h4>

<h5 style="margin-top:1em;">Games of any genre, platform, language, degree of completion, already released or non-released, which meet one or more of the following criteria</h5>

<ol>
<li>A game realizing an innovative user interface<br>
A game that employs features such as natural language processing, image recognition or gesture control to present a new kind of experience</li>
<li>A game created through an automatic generation process<br>
A game that creates a world where the game play or the environment in which the users are playing is changed dramatically according to selections made by the users</li>
<li>A game with an interactive story-telling concept<br>
A game that presents a story experience in a new way with a potential of developing into a tool to create a totally new story</li>
<li>A game with emergent elements<br>
A game that creates a new form of game play by skillfully incorporating the physical system into the game play elements and by combining AIs</li>
<li>An amazing game<br>
Any kind of new, eye-grabbing, and impressive game!!</li>
</ol>

<h5 style="margin-top:1em;">Games to which the following conditions apply <u>will NOT</u> meet the selection criteria:</h5>

<ol>
<li>A game in which only the elements comprising the game are the key factor<br>
A game in which the newness and highlight are focused on the elements comprising the game (such as the background setting, situation, character design, graphics, story, audio, etc.) instead of the game itself</li>
<li>A game of a new genre created by combining or rehashing existing genres<br>
However, a game providing a truly new game experience may be considered for acceptance.</li>
<li>A game that is new only in targeting a specific user group<br>
A game will not be deemed as being new and innovative just because it is focused on a specific user group (such as female users or the elderly). However, a game providing a truly new game experience may be considered for acceptance.</li>
<li>A game created for the purpose of demonstrating a technological innovation, experimental business model, or distribution mechanism<br>
Games of this kind will not be completely rejected from the screening process, but they must demonstrate that they are capable of directly and tangibly changing the game experience.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-top:1em;">Note: The above guidelines are provided solely for the purpose of outlining the basic principles.</p>
