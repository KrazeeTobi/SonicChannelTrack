						<p>If you would like to meet an exhibitor on Business Day, we encourage you to utilize the <a class="n_link" href="../meeting/bms.html">Asia Business Gateway</a>, a “matching system” available on the official TGS2017 website that visitors can use to set up meetings with an exhibitor during TGS2017. Use of the system is free of charge.</p>
						<p>By registering to use this system, Business Day visitors will be able to search technologies, products, services and other information related to exhibitors, contact the relevant persons at an exhibitor, and request an appointment for a meeting on Business Day.</p>

						<p>There are no cloakrooms available within the International Exhibition Halls. However, there are coin-operated storage lockers at the second-floor concourse and other locations.

					<dd>
						<p>We ask that all visitors turn off the power on their mobile routers as well as turn off the Wi-Fi functions on smartphones, handheld game consoles, etc., when inside the Makuhari Messe International Exhibition Halls 1 - 8 (See <a class="n_link" href="../visitor/attention.html">“For your attention”</a>). </p>
						<p>This is because the sudden increase of recent years in the number of mobile devices in use has been creating a poor radio wave environment within the exhibition halls. This can have an adverse effect on the demonstrations and trial game-playing taking place at the venue. If you would like to use wireless LAN, there will be a Wi-Fi hotspot (free of charge) available on the second-floor concourse (near the escalator) of Halls 1 – 8.</p>
