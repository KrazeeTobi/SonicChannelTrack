					Beware of heat exhaustion

Severely warm  condition is possibly expected in and around the venue. Be sure to keep hydrated and replenish electrolytes (salt) as the crowded conditions both within and outside the exhibition halls can make you prone to excessive sweating.

	<ul class="atten">
	<li>・Queuing all night for TOKYO GAME SHOW entry is strictly prohibited.</li>
	<li>・To prevent accidents, there is to be no running at the exhibition halls. Visitors who carry out behavior that is deemed dangerous, disruptive to other visitors, an interference of the smooth operation of the event, etc., may be refused entry or ordered to leave the TOKYO GAME SHOW by the Management Office.</li>
	<li>・When watching stage performances at exhibitor booths, cheering, shouting out, call-and-response, jumping and other such fan behavior are prohibited.</li>

	<li>・<span class="underline">Turn the power off mobile routers and turn off the Wi-Fi functions on smartphones, handheld game consoles, etc., when inside exhibition halls 1 through 11. </span>The sudden increase in recent years in the number of mobile devices in use has been creating a poor radio wave environment within exhibition halls. Because there is a limit to the amount of wireless LAN signals available, if too many devices using wireless LAN are present, it can have a significantly adverse effect on the demonstrations and trial game-playing taking place at the venue. If you would like to use wireless LAN, there will be a Wi-Fi hotspot on Central Mall and Esplanade.</li>
