            <h2 class="spacing">Games to which the following conditions will NOT meet the selection criteria:</h2>
            <h3>A game in which only the elements comprising the game are the key facto</h3>
            <p>A game in which the newness and highlights are focused on the one elements comprising the game (such as the background setting, situation, character design, graphics, story, audio, etc.) instead of the game itself.</p>
            <h3>A game of a new genre created by combining or rehashing existing genres</h3>
            <p>However, a game providing a truly new game experience may be considered for acceptance.</p>
            <h3>A game that is new only in targeting a specific user group</h3>
            <p>A game will not be deemed as being new and innovative just because it is focused on a specific user group (such as female users or the elderly). However, a game providing a truly new game experience may be considered for acceptance.</p>
            <h3>A game created for the purpose of demonstrating a technological innovation, experimental business model, or distribution mechanism</h3>
            <p>A game of this kind will not be completely rejected from the screening process but they must demonstrate that it is capable of directly and tangibly providing a new game experience.</p>
