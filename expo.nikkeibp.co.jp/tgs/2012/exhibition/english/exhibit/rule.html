<h2>Rules Governing TOKYO GAME SHOW 2012</h2>
<p><span>■Overseas Management Office (OMO)</span><br />
・The OMO is the operating secretariat of TOKYO GAME SHOW 2012 organized by the organizer and co-organizer of the Show.</p>
<p><span>■Eligibility for Exhibiting in the Show</span><br />
・Exhibitors are limited to companies and other organizations supplying products and services consistent with the purpose of the Show as set by the OMO. The OMO has the right to determine if any product or service is consistent with the purpose of the Show.
<p><span>■Restriction of Exhibits and Products for Sale</span><br />
・Exhibits are limited to those that meet the Ethical Rules of CESA. The exhibition of products related to software not in compliance with the Ethical Rules is prohibited.<br />
・Promotion of software for consumer use is the content of activities of any exhibitor, in principle.<br />
・Products not handled by exhibitors cannot be exhibited at the Show.<br />
・Sales of products are allowed only in the Sales Area.
</p>
<p><span>■Regulations for Exhibit</span><br />
・The decorating/exhibiting methods are described in the "Exhibitors Manual" to be supplied by the OMO, and all exhibitors are required to follow the guidelines in the Manual. There are limits to special structures, such as hanging structure and two-story booths, and the height of exhibition space, depending on the number of booths and location of booths.<br />
・Each exhibitor must ensure that its exhibit does not interfere with those of adjacent exhibitors. The OMO will determine, based on the Exhibitors Manual, whether an exhibitor is interfering with another exhibit or whether there is violation of rules, and the exhibitor is to comply with the OMO's determination.
</p>
<p><span>■Exhibitor Name</span><br />
・The exhibitor name on the Booth Space Application Form must be the official name. Unless the OMO is informed of any changes in advance, the name on the form will be used for the exhibitors list in the Show advertisements, official web sites of the Show, guidebook, etc.
</p>
<p><span>■Determination of Booth Location</span><br />
・The location of booths will be determined at a booth location selection meeting to be held on June 15, 2012, (for exhibitors that applied for 40 booths or more) and June 26, 2012 (for exhibitors that applied for fewer than 40 booths).<br />
・If the exhibitor will not be able to attend the booth location selection meeting, the exhibitor must entrust the booth location selection to the OMO in advance.<br />
・Selection methods: <br />
・In descending order beginning with exhibitors requesting a larger number of booths, exhibitors will be asked to select desired booth locations from among available booths, prepared by the organizer in advance, based on the number of booths.<br />
・The selection order, if there are multiple exhibitors with the same number of booths, will be as follows: <br /><br />

1.Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show (TOKYO GAME SHOW 2011) and applied for booths before the application deadline.<br />
2.Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show but applied for booths after the deadline.<br />
3.Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show but applied for booths before the deadline.<br />
4.Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show and applied for booths after the deadline.<br />
(AMENDMENT)<br />
5. If there are multiple exhibitors in the above conditions, the member of Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) has priority to select a booth location.  Further determination in the same conditions will be selected by a lottery. <br /><br />

Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show and applied for booths after the deadline.<br />
* Depending on the state of applications, there may be cases in which the selection method will be changed in advance.<br />
 In that case, the OMO will send notification before the booth location selection meeting.<br />
・In the case of an exhibitor applying for 40 or more booth spaces, the organizer will assure the exhibitor of an island configuration (a layout without any adjoining booths).<br />
・It is not possible to change the number of booths at the booth location selection meeting.<br />
・If the number of booths cannot be accommodated during the booth location selection meeting, the exhibitor may have to adjust the number of booths requested in consultation with the OMO, or may be asked to change the depth-to-width ratio of the exhibition area, with the applied area being unchanged.<br />
・The exhibitor cannot change the location of booths after their selection. However, there may be cases in which the location of the exhibitor's booth will be changed, based on the exhibitor's consultation with the OMO, due to a booth cancellation by another exhibitor, the addition of new booths or other reasons.</p>

<p><span>■Shape of the Booth Space</span><br />
・The shape of the booth space (___ booths in depth and ___ booths in width) should be applied for by placing whole numbers in the appropriate spaces.<br />
・An exhibitor's space can be at most 8 booths deep and 16 booths wide.<br />
・An exhibitor who desires 128 or more booth spaces is requested to consult with the OMO regarding the shape of the booth space.<br />
・To facilitate the overall Show site layout, an exhibitor with a booth space of a difficult shape may be requested to change its shape.</p>

<p><span>■Period</span><br />
・The exhibitor must decorate its booth space during the preparatory period to be defined by the OMO, and complete the work before the opening of the Show on Sept. 20, 2012.<br />

<p><span>■Damage Compensation</span><br />

</p>

<p><span>■Cancellation of the Show</span><br />

Apart from the foregoing, the OMO will not bear any liability for cancellation of the Show.<br />
・The organizer / OMO will not be responsible for any damages inflicted on the exhibitor, whether direct or indirect, through force majeur or by command or instruction of a third party.
