		<li>・Selection methods:<br />- In descending order beginning with exhibitors requesting a larger number of booths, exhibitors will be asked to select desired booth locations from among available booths, prepared by the organizer in advance, based on the number of booths.<br />- The selection order, if there are multiple exhibitors with the same number of booths, will be as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>1. Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show (TOKYO GAME SHOW 2015) and applied for booths before the application deadline.</li>
			<li>2. Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show but applied for booths after the deadline.</li>
			<li>3. Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show but applied for booths before the deadline.</li>
			<li>4. Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show and applied for booths after the deadline.</li>
			<li>5. If there are multiple exhibitors in the above conditions, the member of Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) has priority to select a booth location.</li>
		</ul>
		Further determination in the same conditions will be selected by a lottery.<br />
*Depending on the state of applications, there may be cases in which the selection method will be changed in advance. In that case, the OMO will send notification before the booth location selection meeting.

		<li>・The exhibitor cannot change the location of booths after their selection. However, there may be cases in which the location of the exhibitor's booth will be changed, based on the exhibitor's consultation with the OMO, due to a booth cancellation by another exhibitor, the addition of new booths or other reasons.</li>
