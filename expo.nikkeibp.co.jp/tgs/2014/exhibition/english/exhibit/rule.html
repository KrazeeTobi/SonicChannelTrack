<h2><strong>Rules Governing TOKYO GAME SHOW 2014</strong></h2>

<p>
<span>■Overseas Management Office (OMO)</span><br />
・The OMO is the operating secretariat of TOKYO GAME SHOW 2014 organized by the organizer and co-organizer of the Show.
</p>

<p>
<span>■Eligibility for Exhibiting in the Show</span><br />
・Exhibitors are limited to companies and other organizations supplying products and services consistent with the purpose of the Show as set by the OMO. The OMO has the right to determine if any product or service is consistent with the purpose of the Show.
</p>

<p>
<span>■Restriction of Exhibits and Products for Sale</span><br />
・Exhibits are limited to those that meet the Ethical Rules of CESA. The exhibition of products related to software not in compliance with the Ethical Rules is prohibited.<br />
・Promotion of software for consumer use is the content of activities of any exhibitor, in principle.<br />
・Products not handled by exhibitors cannot be exhibited at the Show.<br />
・Sales of products are allowed only in the Merchandise Sales Area, PC Game Area (except Turnkey Booth), and Cosplay Area (except Turnkey Booth)<br />
</p>

<p>
<span>■Regulations for Exhibit</span><br />
・Each exhibitor must follow the instructions for booth decorations and structures, sound volume, exhibition contents and methods, manner of performance, etc. are defined in the “Exhibitors Manual” to be supplied by OMO.<br />
・For booth decorations and structures, sound volume, exhibit contents/methods, manner of performance with no provisions in the “Exhibitors Manual”, OMO has an authorization to cancel an exhibition, and each exhibitor must follow OMO instructions regardless pre and ongoing exhibition periods.<br />
・Each exhibitor must ensure that its exhibit does not interfere with those of adjacent exhibitors. The OMO will determine, based on the Exhibitors Manual, whether an exhibitor is interfering with another exhibit or whether there is violation of rules, and the exhibitor is to comply with the OMO's determination.<br />
・Each exhibitor must pay all the cost of amendments and cancellations of booth decorations/structures, sound volume, exhibition contents/methods, manners of performance, etc. caused by the instructions of OMO.
</p>

<p>
<span>■Determination of Booth Location</span><br />
・The location of booths will be determined at a booth location selection meeting to be held on June 20, 2014, (for exhibitors that applied for 40 booths or more) and June 27, 2014 (for exhibitors that applied for fewer than 40 booths).<br />
・If the exhibitor will not be able to attend the booth location selection meeting, the exhibitor must entrust the booth location selection to the OMO in advance.<br />
・Selection methods:
<span style="display:block;padding:2px 10px;color:#D7D7D7;font-weight:normal;">
- In descending order beginning with exhibitors requesting a larger number of booths, exhibitors will be asked to select desired booth locations from among available booths, prepared by the organizer in advance, based on the number of booths.<br />
- The selection order, if there are multiple exhibitors with the same number of booths, will be as follows:<br />
<span style="display:block;padding:2px 10px;color:#D7D7D7;font-weight:normal;">
1. Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show (TOKYO GAME SHOW 2013) and applied for booths before the application deadline.<br />
2. Exhibitors that participated in the preceding Show but applied for booths after the deadline.<br />
3. Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show but applied for booths before the deadline.<br />
4. Exhibitors that did not participate in the preceding Show and applied for booths after the deadline.<br />
5. If there are multiple exhibitors in the above conditions, the member of Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) has priority to select a booth location.<br />
</span>
</span>
Further determination in the same conditions will be selected by a lottery.<br />
*Depending on the state of applications, there may be cases in which the selection method will be changed in advance. In that case, the OMO will send notification before the booth location selection meeting.<br />
・In the case of an exhibitor applying for 40 or more booth spaces, the organizer will assure the exhibitor of an island configuration (a layout without any adjoining booths).<br />
・It is not possible to change the number of booths at the booth location selection meeting.<br />
・If the number of booths cannot be accommodated during the booth location selection meeting, the exhibitor may have to adjust the number of booths requested in consultation with the OMO, or may be asked to change the depth-to-width ratio of the exhibition area, with the applied area being unchanged.<br />
・The exhibitor cannot change the location of booths after their selection. However, there may be cases in which the location of the exhibitor's booth will be changed, based on the exhibitor's consultation with the OMO, due to a booth cancellation by another exhibitor, the addition of new booths or other reasons.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span>■Shape of the Booth Space</span><br />

(For 40 or more booths)・An exhibitor’s space can be at most 7 booths in deep and maximum of 8 booths in width in the case of less than 7 booth in deep.<br />
In case for exhibitor that applied for 49 booths or more, the shape of booth space should be applied to a multiple of 7 and 7 booths in deep.<br />
