            the base station which leads the world and sends the latest information

            including DVD and internet terminals, PCs and mobile phones, have 
            been organized in the entertainment software industry. Under these 
            circumstances, beyond the traditional framework of games, a blending 
            of games and a wide variety of entertainment, such as movies and music, 
            is accelerated in the entertainment software. This will bring everybody 
            closer to games and create more diverse ways to enjoy games in our 
            daily life.<br>

            industry is ready to take the first step toward a new area through
