      Computer Entertainment Software Association (CESA, Chairman: Kagemasa Kozuki, 
      location: NishiShimbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo) has finalized the schedule for 
      &quot;Tokyo Game Show 2000 Autumn,&quot;September 22(Fri) 2000, will be 
      a business day, while the September 23 (Saturday) to 24 (Monday) will be 
      general admission day. The show will be open from 10 am to 5 pm on all days.<br>
      The venue will be Exhibition Halls 1 to 8 at &quot;Makuhari Messe&quot; 
      (Nippon Convention Center, Mihama-ku,Chiba). 150,000 visitors are expected 
      to attend the show.<br>
      <br>
      The Tokyo Game Show Secretariat will open applications for exhibitors for 
      CESA member companies on May 22 (Mon.). The press conference and exhibitors' 
      briefing and booth position selection meeting will be held on July 5 (Wed.) 
      at Ginza Gas Hall (Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo). A detailed overview of the show 
      will be given at the press conference.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Tokyo Game Show&quot; was first held in August 1996, and from the 
      following year it came to be held twice a year, in Spring and Autumn. 2000 
      Autumn will be the 9th time the show has been held. As the only comprehensive 
      exhibition of computer entertainment software in Japan, the number of people 
      from industry circles and from the press from Japan and overseas has increased 
      each time the show has been held, and it has grown into a show that attracts 
      worldwide attention.<br>
      <br>
      The computer entertainment industry, in an effort to keep up with high-performance 
      family game units, is progressing on an almost daily basis. This is the 
      evident in the wide range of software developed utilizing original ideas 
      and state-of-the-art technology, and the appearance of network games utilizing 
      the Internet and software for portable handy game machines. We are seeing 
      a large number of games that players can enjoy in a variety of different 
      ways. With the further broadening of the entertainment qualities of games, 
      games that can be enjoyed by a wider range of users are hitting the market 
      one after another.<br>
      <br>
      Preparations are underway to ensure visitors from throughout the world will 
      enjoy &quot;Tokyo Game Show 2000 Autumn,&quot; which will exhaustively showcase 
      the attractions of computer entertainment software with content more enhanced 
      than in the past. We look forward to seeing you there.<br>
