								<div class="section"><p>At the Tokyo Game Show 2011, for the purpose of protecting the visitors' security, baggage inspections will be conducted on both the Public Days (September 17, Saturday, and September 18, Sunday). We will set up baggage inspection booths along the paths leading to the admission gates.<br />
There are items that are strictly prohibited at the venue (see below). Keep your baggage as compact as possible so that the inspections will proceed smoothly. It is expected that those visitors with large amounts of baggage will have longer inspections (for example, those who plan to cosplay). Please arrive early to allow enough of time for this. In addition, with regard to pet bottles, we might check the contents inside.<br />
We request for your understanding and cooperation to ensure the safe management of the venue.<br />
