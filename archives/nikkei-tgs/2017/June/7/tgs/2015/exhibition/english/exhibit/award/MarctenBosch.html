                <h3><span>1</span>What's your background in making games?</h3>
                <p>I grew up in France. My first console was a Sega Master System and I owned most consoles since then. I always knew I wanted to be a designer and probably a game designer. As a kid, I filled tons of notebook with game designs. Each notebook was a strategy guide for a game that didn't exist. I moved to the US for college. I studied game programming at DigiPen and computer graphics & engineering at Brown. After that I briefly worked at EA, but I decided I wanted to make my own games so I showed a prototype of Miegakure at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop at the Game Developers Conference and people seemed to be into the game, so I kept working on it.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>2</span>How much time did you spend working on the game?</h3>
                <p>I have been working on the game for about 5 years.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>3</span>How did you come up with the concept?</h3>
                <p>I had the idea for a hyper-dimensional game in college, maybe around 2005? When you program a 3D game, every object’s position is represented using three numbers (usually called x, y and z), but that concept easily generalizes. It made me start to wonder, why not four numbers or more? What would an actual 4-dimensional game be like? It turns out some people have already thought about what you could do if you could move in 4D space that you couldn’t do before, such as being able to steal from closed containers without opening them, binding separate rings without breaking them, etc... I realized a game would be the perfect way to let you perform these actions, as games are all about let you do things you can't do in real life.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>4</span>What development tools did you use?</h3>
                <p>I built our own engine in C++. It is cross platform and uses OpenGL for rendering. I use Visual Studio as my editor. Our artist works in Photoshop and 3ds Max.</p>
            <!-- / InterviewAreaIn --></div>
            <div class="InterviewAreaIn">
                <h3><span>5</span>What were the significant changes from the "old buggy prototype"<br /> you made a year ago?</h3>
                <p>The first few prototypes were not very good, and I later realized the main reason was that even though the game was taking place in a 4D world it was not clear to me what the consequences of being able to move in 4D were. What could you do that you couldn’t do in 3D? It would not be very interesting to build a game where you just spend your time running around and shooting things, even if it was 4D... In order to understand a concept you need to interact with it in a meaningful way, to push on it and have it pull back, not just have it part of the background.<br />Also, the difficult thing about making a 4D game is that you can't take anything for granted, from how to render object to how to texture them and how to make them collide with each other... The prototype started very basic, but I later realized I could get much more visually complex objects in the game.</p>

                <h3><span>7</span>What is your goal as a game developer?</h3>
                <p>I would like to move the medium of video games forward by building games that showcase what it can do.</p>

                <p>Good luck with your game! Making experimental games is hard but it is people like you that will change the world by changing what games it plays.</p>

                        <p>I came up with the concept when I was trying to sleep. I was trying to come up with an idea that I could implement in 2 weeks and still be interesting. Since I couldn't do art, I knew the game would probably involve objects as simple as a white cube.</p>

                        <p>The game "Kyoto" was a homage to the beautiful city that I've lived in.

                        <p>Ultima Online was the first MMO I played when I grew up.  It was very impressive to see so many players all across the world play the same game!  I wanted to be able to build the world together with my friends.  I began building early builds of a game that allowed multiple people to build in the world together.  It was very basic, but even early on it was fun to build together.</p>
