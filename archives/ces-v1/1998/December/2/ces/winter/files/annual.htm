NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  Organizers of the 1997 
International Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</sup></font> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</sup></font>), the premier 
event for the consumer electronics industry, announced that the second 
annual Exhibitor Space Priority process (ESP) will be an active on-site 
program throughout the show which runs January 9-12, 1997.
<br><br>
ESP offices, which also will be manned the day before the show opens, 
will be in two locations: the Registration Pavilion at the Las Vegas 
Convention Center, and Hall &quot;G&quot; in the lower level of the Sands Expo &amp; 
Convention Center.
<br><br>
Priority and on-site space selection is an on-going, accepted trade show 
industry practice.  ESP was instituted last year at CES to streamline the 
WCES selection process allowing companies to learn their booth numbers 
and their location early in 1996 rather than waiting until later in the 
year.
<br><br>
Under this on-site selection system a WCES exhibitor is assigned a 
specific time to attend the ESP room and select space for the 1998 WCES.  
The exhibitor receives this information along with costs, services and 
floor plans three to four weeks before the 1997 show.
<br><br>
Dan Cole, director of sales for CES, said &quot;there were a few blips in this 
new CES process the first year but we have listened to our customers and 
improved the process for 1998 WCES booth selection.  For instance, 
exhibitors will have more one-on-one time with sales staff on-site at the 
1997 WCES.  There will also be  private rooms for exhibitors to view the 
floor plans and make their selections with sales staff to assist them.&quot;
<br><br>
For the 1998 WCES, the following locations and categories are scheduled: 
the Las Vegas Convention Center consists of satellite, audio and video, 
accessories, telephony, SoHo and converging; the Sands Expo &amp; Convention 
Center includes mobile, cellular and wireless, cellular accessories, 
personal electronics, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS); and the 
Las Vegas Hilton, home theater and home automation systems.
<br><br>
Specialty audio and adult software exhibitors will again be selecting 
their exhibit space later in the year.  CES staff will contact them by 
telephone and mail to make their selections using a similar ESP process.
