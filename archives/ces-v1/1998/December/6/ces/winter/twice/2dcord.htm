Cordless Phones Still Get A<br>
A Boost From 900 MHz Models

</b></font></center><br>

&quot;For calendar '96, we'll end up selling twice as many 900 MHz cordless telephones as we did a year ago. And we're projecting that we'll grow at a 50% rate next year. In 1995, about 1.5 million units were sold. Last year we saw about 3 million, and in 1997, we're looking for 4.5 million.&quot;
<br><br>That comes from John McNenney, Panasonic's national marketing manager for telecommunications. McNenney's positive view of the 900 MHz business   and the cordless market overall   is supported by factory sales of cordless equipment generally, as indicated by Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), and by other cordless product manufacturers.
<br><br>CEMA reports that there has been a steady curve upwards, with 1989 being a watershed year, when 10 million cordless phones were sold, dollars reached 830 million, and nearly a quarter of all households had the equipment.
<br><br>By 1995, 19.5 million units were taken by retailers, for $1.4 billion in manufacturer sales and a 55% consumer base. Last year, 21 million devices went to market, factory sales were $1.2 billion, and 64% of homes were using cordless equipment.
<br><br>In 1997, CEMA expects 22 million units to be sold for $1.2 billion. (Household penetration estimates for '97 are not yet available.)
<br><br>Price compression not withstanding, the cordless category continues to get a boost from the 900 MHz analog and digital products. But some manufacturers aren't counting out the main revenue-producing analog 10-25 channel, 46-49 MHz phones yet, even though they expect activity on the lower frequency models, particularly the 10 channel, to taper off. 
<br><br>Says McNenney, who has just introduced a 32 channel, Spread Spectrum 900 MHz digital product, &quot;Lots of people have been using cordless phones, but have been unhappy with the 46-49 MHz frequency products that don't perform as well in terms of sound quality or range. So replacement customers are looking for better performance equipment.&quot;
<br><br>McNenney thinks that as 900 MHz analog models become increasingly popular, coupled with the growing presence of 900 MHz digital units, there will be price erosion this year in all cordless categories.
In that regard, Eldon Chuck, product marketing manager for the communications groups at Thomson Consumer Electronics, emphasizes, &quot;Every manufacturer is going to be aggressively pursuing the 900 MHz market, which is excellent for consumers.&quot;
<br><br>Chuck amplifies, &quot;There's still a gap from the leader price point of $29 today, but we've seen 900 MHz going below $100. And this year, you'll see that continue. At the 900 level you'll have $89 to $100. And below that, you'll see the lower frequencies with various add-ons such as feature phones, Caller ID with an LCD display, etc. So you'll still have different things at 46-49 that supports that category. The more featured 900 units will be maintained at prices above $l00, primarily in the digital; and in the Spread Spectrum, also. What I think you will see happening is that the Spread Spectrum technology will continue to come down. And that's where you're separating the men from the boys. It is a distinct upgrade in quality and distance, and the environment.&quot;
<br><br>In Chuck's view, the key to the 900 MHz technology is, &quot;How quick you get back to the price point where it becomes very appealing to the consumer. Then, the consumer will be saying, `Now I have a technology that is as close to corded as I can get, with all the convenience of a cordless phone.' Today, it's selling for just under $200. That's unreasonable for most consumers. When that gets below $100, that's when 900 will grow. But I don't think it will ever get to the point where it completely demolishes the 46-49 category.&quot;
<br><br>However, Matt Ramage, marketing director for VTech, does see the 900 category &quot;absolutely taking over the cordless market, and it will probably be skewed toward analog pieces, just because it's price driven.&quot;
<br><br>What's going happen in general, he believes, is, &quot;Because the lower end, lower MHz units don't work very well they're going to start falling away. But that's going to take a couple of years since they represent a low price point and there's still a market for that.&quot;
<br><br>For about six months in 1992, VTech occupied a unique position, says Ramage, &quot;as the first manufacturer to bring a 900 digital phone to market.&quot; As he sees the business, &quot;For 1997, and the coming years, there will be a full integration with these products into other features, such as answering machines and Caller ID. Anything you can conceive as a standalone telephony product   voice recognition, alphanumeric name dialing, all kinds of add-on features    you'll see some price drops across the board. That is just the natural trend of the market.&quot;
<br><br>Referring to the CEMA's numbers, he says of the 22 million unit factory sales estimate for 1997, &quot;You're probably looking at about 25% being 900 MHz,&quot;   asserting, &quot;more people want to be wireless. They want to have a cordless phone in their home office, or in their offices. They want to be anywhere and not miss a call. There's a huge consumer demand out there.&quot;
<br><br>Sony Electronics' Tim Baxter agrees. Baxter, the company's marketing director for residential telephones, reflecting on Ramage's vision of fully integrated 900 phones, notes that Sony has been providing Caller ID capability throughout its cordless line, including a 900 MHz phone with Caller ID for Call Waiting, Type II.
<br><br>This year, it has introduced, &quot;By combination of a bit of a unique algorithm,&quot; two 235 channel 43-49 MHz phones that incorporate Caller ID on Call Waiting, with disposition. Baxter says, &quot;Last year was a great year for us in total residential telephones with more than double digit growth. And in the cordless category it was even stronger, we're getting close to triple digit growth.&quot;
<br><br>As prices decline in cordless equipment, and consumers continue to look for 900 solutions that provide them with greater sound quality performance and range, Baxter expects the 46-49 category to decline on a dollar basis and be relegated more toward entry level pricing. He stresses that in the 46-49 MHz range, Sony is focusing heavily on the ITAD category, saying, &quot;the cordless answering systems are really the second key growth segment.&quot;
<br><br>Baxter adds, &quot;We have only one 10 channel entry level phone product. Whether it will be on the shelves this year is still under review. All of our energy will be in the 25 channel.&quot; He emphasizes that the company is experiencing growth with a 25 channel, two line model, observing that, &quot;46-49 MHz is very much alive. There is still some play, there are still some opportunities there for both the basic and some specialized products.&quot;
<br><br>Like Baxter, Seong Ohm, product manager, 46-49 MHz, cordless phones, for Lucent Technologies, says the market has switched from under 10 channels and 10 channel products to mostly 25 channels, and that the growth is in ITADs.
<br><br>Ohm, who expects that prices will decline this year as they did in 1996, at about the same magnitude, indicates that 46-49 basic phones, probably under $100, will be, &quot;pretty much flat.&quot;
<br><br>However, she says projections on ITADs, show a 13% to 15% growth rate, year over year.
<br><br>As with Thomson's Chuck, Ohm, &quot;doesn't believe the 46-49 units will disappear in the near future, if you look at the next five years.&quot; In her opinion, &quot;I think what you're going to see is that the 46-49 range is going to offer consumers a lot of value and features, such as advanced Caller ID   rather than having people use adjunct boxes   and at very good price points. Whereas the 900 is going to concentrate on probably the range and clarity.&quot;
<br><br>Also, Ohm projects, &quot;In the ITAD category we will be concentrating on expanding our line up in the digital answering system, giving people better sound quality.&quot;
<br><br>Her colleague, Donna Silbert, Lucent's product line manager, 900 MHz, seconds Ohm's views, and expands, &quot;Let's say you can buy a 900 MHz unit for $100. It doesn't have any features. It's very basic versus a 46-49 unit that's an integrated answering system, for instance. So you're really talking about the price discrepancy and difference being a lot greater now, when you're going basic to basic. A few years from now that might be different. But right now there's enough of a delta that there's plenty of  space in the market for both categories. If you compare the basic 46-49 unit and the 900 unit there's probably anywhere from a $50 to $60 between an analog 900 basic and a 46-49 basic.&quot;
