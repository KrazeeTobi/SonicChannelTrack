Microsoft Will Deliver A Windows-based<br> Software Developers Kit

</b></font></center><br>

As part of what it sees as the next logical extension of its Simply Interactive PC (SIPC) concept, Microsoft yesterday announced it will deliver a Windows-based software developers kit (SDK) in February that will enable PCs to seamlessly blend television programming, the Internet, and a variety of data services. The company is licensing the technology to OEMs, which are expected to begin selling complete systems in time for Christmas 1997.
<br><br>Microsoft also says it has developed new user interface elements   designed to be used with a remote control   which will be optimized for distance family viewing and intuitive control over a variety of entertainment devices. New entertainment applets have been added for control over conventional A/V gear, such as VCRs, CD players, and by the time the first systems ship, DVD players.
<br><br>By being able to combine TV and Internet content with a variety of data services, Microsoft expects content creators to begin developing a variety of new applications and subscription services. While the broadcast architecture is &quot;network agnostic&quot;   meaning it will work with DBS, cable and other broadcast systems   programmers will have a single programming model for developing content for both networks and the Internet.
<br><br>Thomas Gershaw, senior product manager of Microsoft's consumer platforms division, says that although the typical living room now has numerous, single-purpose devices, the new SDK will help position the PC as &quot;a single open entertainment platform for content viewing and creation&quot; that will integrate networks and data services. And because the Internet can be delivered via broadcast networks, the current bottleneck slowing the transmission of Internet content can be remedied.
<br><br>In laying out a technology timetable for 1997, Gershaw says Microsoft expects electronic programming guides and tuners will be added to PCs during the first half of the year. In addition, broadcast systems will start to be upgraded and content development will be started.
<br><br>During the second half of the year, Gershaw predicts, distance-viewing interfaces will emerge, broadcast services will be added to PCs, broadcast systems will start delivering data, and OEMs will start to release broadcast-enabled PCs.
<br><br>In private demos being held in a suite at the Hilton Hotel, Microsoft is offering glimpses of what the technology might allow. Using a large-screen Mitsubishi VGA monitor, the company showed an alpha version of its electronic programming guide, which uses some StarSight technology. The system creates virtual channels, so users can call up data services, Internet content or TV programming from a single screen. 
<br><br>Microsoft also released the names of 50 companies it says will be developing technologies and products around Microsoft's technologies. Among the companies mentioned are AST, Adaptec, DirecTv, Fujitsu, Gateway 2000, Hitachi, Hughes, IBM, Matsushita, Micron Electronics, Mitsubishi, NBC, NEC, Samsung, Sanyo, Sony, StarSight, Toshiba and USA Network.
