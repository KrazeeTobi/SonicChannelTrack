Personal Information Products<br>Attracts Several New Players

</b></font></center><br>



Personal Information products, from Windows CE handheld PCs to organizers, are attracting new market entrants and are debuting here at CES in some radical new formats.
<br><br> Brother established a new Personal Information Product division that will offer products later this year, which may or may not include desktop organizers/PDAs shown here at CES. 
<br><br>In addition,  LG Electronics  is making a push into both Smartphones and Windows CE handhelds, and is planning to offer later this year a digital CDMA Smartphone with built-in alphanumeric pager, CDMA cellphone, and a databank that can send and receive faxes.
<br><br>The unit, called the IPC-1000, (shown at CES in analog cellular form) is the smallest Smartphone to be introduced, weighing less than 11 ounces, claims the company. It has a built-in 4,800-baud fax modem, 5,000 number telephone book, keyboard plus pen-input capacity and is also being offered for OEM supply.
<br><br>In Windows CE, LG Electronics, redesigned its Windows CE product first shown at Comdex, to become the first to incorporate a 28.8 Kbps modem. Also with new stylying, the model GP40M, will ship at the end of February. The company is also planning to offer a CDMA-based Windows CE/Smartphone HPC by the end of the year, according to S.W. Nam, LG Electronics brand manager, marking another first in the category.
<br><br> Canon  is also entering the databank market, introducing its first low priced pocket calculator with a databank to store up to 164 names. The model DM-320 will ship in March at a suggested retail price of $12.95.
<br><br>Brother is showing several new products under its new Personal Information Division, including an Information Control Center, a desktop databank with 3&quot; by 5&quot; LCD screen and detachable keyboard that serves as an answering machine, scheduler, calendar with memo function and a built in printer. The unit is designed to work with a telephone to serve as a family center for messages and storing other information.
<br><br>Also on display at Brother is the Millenia Memo, a &quot;digital ink&quot; tablet which simply allows users to store pen-input memos. A third product shown, called Pen Station, is a mini, proprietary PC with a removeable pen tablet/screen and wireless keyboard. 
<br><br>Brother senior VP Dean Shulman said the company will offer three new products, with Internet connectivity, under the new personal information division, this fall, but he would identify the products specifically. Each will use a proprietary, full web browser developed in conjunction with STNC in England.
<br><br>In other organizer related offerings at CES,  Franklin Electronic Publishers  debuted a line of nine new products under the Rolodex brand, the first to be offered since the company purchased Rolodex in October. The company will also begin marketing its Sidekick organizer under the Rolodex brand begining in March and plans to drop the price of is Sidekick units &quot;significantly&quot; at that time said Franklin spokesmen.
<br><br>Regarding Windows CE,  Casio  said the company's Casseopeia Windows CE products are currently sold out despite its doubling shipments both last year and for the first quarter. In addition, Casio executive vice president of marketing Gary Rado, said that the higher capacity 4MB units are outselling the 2MB units, two to one.
<br><br>In other innovations, LG Electronics is showing new designs in smartphones to guage retail reaction including a curved unit in a leopard print finish and a flip phone model with a mirror in the flip cover (aimed presumably at women).
