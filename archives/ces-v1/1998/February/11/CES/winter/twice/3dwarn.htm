Warner Outlines Plans For DVD Movie Rollout

</b></font></center><br>

During private meetings scheduled during CES, Warner Home Video executives announced their initial support for a DVD movie rollout and presented a study that projected DVD software could hit $3 billion at wholesale by the end of the third year of availability if the format receives widespread studio support.<BR><BR>During demos set up in its suite, Warner used a Toshiba DVD player and movies such as The Bridges of Madison County, Space Jam and Batman Forever to show better-than-laserdisc detail and resolution, multi-language capability with six-channel sound, and both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.<BR><BR>Perhaps even more interesting was a demo from Intel, which ran DVD and DVD-ROM software on a PC equipped with its secretive Klamath processor. While another system -- a 200MHX MMX Pentium -- was equipped with an internal DVD-ROM drive and an add-in hardware card, the prototype Klamath PC did all the decoding on the processor, with razor-sharp output appearing on both a VGA monitor and a large-screen TV.<BR><BR>Intel's multimedia evangelist for home software, Gregory Berkin, says the company believes that in the future, such a PC will typically sell for about $2,000.<BR><BR>During the meeting, Warner presented the results of market research conducted by Vantis International, a division of San Francisco-based The BASES Group. According to the study, DVD hardware has the potential to sell 2.8 million units in its first full year of availability and could reach a total of 12.1 million units by the end of its third year.<BR><BR>To put that in perspective, DSS hardware sold approximately 1 million units in its first year and is projected to reach a cumulative total of 3.3 million units during its first three years.<BR><BR>As a result, DVD software sales could match the current $3 billion level of VHS sell-through, based on unit sales of 250 million discs -- 25 per person per year -- at an average wholesale price of $12. If the average number of titles per person per year drops to 20, projected aggregate sales fall to $2.4 billion.<BR><BR>However, the report cautions, hitting those numbers is predicated on three important criteria: that the major consumer electronics brands achieve mass distribution; that all of the major studios fully support the format with both new titles and back-catalog releases in mass retail distribution; and that the consumer is presented with a single DVD format.<BR><BR>While several studios, including Warner, Polygram, TriStar and New Line, have announced support, several other prominent studios remain noncommittal, notably Disney, Paramount, Fox and even MCA, despite Matsushita's 20% stake. MGM/UA's DVD titles, slated for April, will include The Birdcage, The Wizard of Oz, Raging Bull and Rocky, while New Line is promising six titles initially, including The Mask, Seven and Dumb and Dumber. TWICE has previously reported Columbia TriStar's lineup.<BR><BR>Warner Home Video president Warren Lieberfarb, who during CES announced that Warner would support the DVD launch with 25 titles this spring, said Warner believes it is imperative to DVD's success that software be available simultaneously with, and priced similarly to, VHS releases. If it is, he says, "we hope that we'll have more sell-through than rental." <BR><BR>Warner's first DVD titles are expected to be available by the end of March. New titles will be released simultaneously with VHS, supplemented by a rollout of 25 to 39 titles from Warner's back catalog.<BR><BR>Lieberfarb, who called DVD "our best effort" to mitigate the impact of potentially competitive video delivery services, such as pay-per-view and the Internet, said Warner will not bundle its titles with hardware -- "We believe we put a lot of value in our content" -- but will probably offer some type of promotional sampler.<BR><BR>According to Richard Marquardt, VP of Warner Advanced Media Operations, the company's manufacturing arm is up and running at a replicating capacity of 32,000 discs a day. The company has already sold nearly a half-million DVD and DVD-ROM discs in Japan, the U.S. and Korea. <BR><BR>Warner estimated the cost of mastering a basic DVD would be in the $12,000 to $15,000 range, with discs containing more elaborate content costing close to $20,000.<BR><BR>Lieberfarb's highly conditional forecast for first-year DVD sales was contested by other members of a DVD discussion panel here at Winter CES yesterday. The difference really wasn't so much in terms of the sales potential, but in the view that things won't be falling into place so conveniently.<BR><BR>During the CEMA roundtable, Larry Pesce of Thomson Consumer Electronics said that although his company planned to begin selling DVD players this spring, that will only be in very limited markets. "Player manufacturers have the capability for a large-scale launch," but it will take more time for software producers to amass enough copies of enough titles. <BR><BR>So, Pesce said, Thomson is looking to go national early in the fourth quarter.
