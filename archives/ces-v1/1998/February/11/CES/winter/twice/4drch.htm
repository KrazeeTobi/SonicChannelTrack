Roach Discusses Plans For RadioShack, Computer City



</b></font></center><br>



Speaking about the decision to close all 17 Incredible Universe (IU) locations, Tandy CEO John Roach called the failure of the chain "a real disappointment," but one from which the company will emerge stronger and more focused.<BR><BR>In an exclusive interview with TWICE CES Daily, Roach said IU's demise was largely the result of poor timing -- the nationwide expansion of the gigastores coincided almost exactly with the general downturn in the consumer electronics industry.<BR><BR>"We took a relatively high-risk venture. We didn't want to be 'me-too,' " Roach said. "In the final analysis, the economics didn't work for us."<BR><BR>Roach said a combination of other factors also led to IU's short and costly life, including increased competition, the expense of one-store advertising in each market IU entered, and the use of non-commissioned sales people on the stores' floors.<BR><BR>Seeking to put the past behind him, Roach outlined a number of new retailing strategies for RadioShack and the remaining 89 Computer City stores in North America. Tandy is closing 19 unprofitable Computer City locations, including all seven of its stores in Los Angeles.<BR><BR>In addition to its plans to open a total of 100 new RadioShack outlets this year -- a goal which Roach says the company is "likely to meet" -- Tandy is introducing two new strategic retail plans for the chain. The first is RadioShack Select, a new dealer program designed to take the chain into small rural towns as well as towns that have no existing RadioShacks.<BR><BR>RadioShack Select stores will be preconstructed modules, about 400 square feet each, that can be set up in existing hardware stores, grocery stores or drug stores by dealers. Inventory will include 1,700 top-selling items cherry-picked from traditional RadioShack stores, and Tandy will offer a financing program to get dealers started.<BR><BR>Roach said Tandy's target is 1,000 RadioShack Select dealers over the next five years. All the Select stores will be located at least 10 miles away from any existing RadioShacks.<BR><BR>The second retail strategy Tandy will try is a store-within-a-store concept for existing RadioShacks that will focus on telephone and telephone services, including wireless and PCS. <BR><BR>The company plans to install the telephone centers into RadioShacks from March through September, with advertising to begin in October. The ministores will include a computer terminal, telephones and trained personnel and are part of Tandy's plan to refocus on telephones, its strongest category.<BR><BR>"Over the next year or two, everyone in America will recognize RadioShack as America's premier telephone supplier," Roach said. "We think RadioShack can be strong in '97, independent of the downturn in the industry."<BR><BR>Tandy's already-announced plans for reviving the remaining Computer City stores include re-merchandising and re-stocking the outlets to appeal to three targets: corporate clients, small office/home office customers, and second-time computer buyers. In its advertising, Roach said Computer City will devote less space to advertising CPUs and more space to products SOHO professionals need, such as peripherals and memory cards.<BR><BR>Roach said it will take the first and possibly the second quarter to get inventory in place at Computer City, as well as train salespeople to deal with corporate clients. He said there are already "subtle" changes afoot in many Computer City locations, but turning the chain around will take time.<BR><BR>As for increasing profits at RadioShack, Roach said Tandy will rely on its strengths -- cellular phone sales, direct-to-home satellite systems, wireless products, and the nuts-and-bolts parts and accessories business -- rather than wait for The Next Big Thing, such as DVD.<BR><BR>"I am not optimistic DVD will be a big consumer product in the short term," Roach said. "Tandy's not hanging its future on how much DVD business we're going to do this year."
