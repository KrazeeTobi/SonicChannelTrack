Ease Of Use Key To Convergence Success

</b></font></center><br>



Turns out top manufacturers have the same concerns about "convergence" that retailers do: They want easy-to-use products on shelves and better communication between all the companies that will offer the new products.<BR><BR>At a manufacturer panel on convergence, Carl Yankowski, president of Sony Electronics, James Firestone, general manager of IBM's Consumer Division, and Marty Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive, said all the buzz over audio/video, computer and telephone companies coming together with digital technology means nothing if consumers can't use -- or aren't interested -- in the resulting products.<BR><BR>"We've got to make technology simple -- dummy it down," Yudkovitz said. "The harder [products] are to use, the less and less likely we are to capture that vast American heartland."<BR><BR>Yankowski said Sony learned from its WebTV launch that communication between retailers and manufacturers is critical to the success of a convergence product. Many dealers didn't realize they would need a telephone line on store floors, he said, in order to display WebTV properly.<BR><BR>Yankowski said he is planning to hold a briefing with Circuit City and Sprint before launching Sony Sprint telephones at the giant retailer to assure a smooth rollout. He added that the "state of confusion" in the PC retail market over the emergence of the MMX chip and Pentium Pro computers was probably responsible for the downturn in retailer PC sales this past Christmas.<BR><BR>"I do believe there needs to be better coordination between chip manufacturers, CPU makers and content providers," Yankowski said. "Companies and industries converging is probably as important as the technologies converging."<BR><BR>Yankowski said the trend toward selling products such as cellular phones and digital broadcast systems for next to nothing in order to secure programming and service contracts is dangerous for the entire industry: "It's very tricky for the hardware guys [because] then we don't have enough revenue and profit to invest in research and development for the future." <BR><BR>When asked about reports of lukewarm sales of WebTV this past Christmas, Yankowski said, "We think we're off to a good start with WebTV." He added that the product is designed to be a cost-effective way to offer Internet access to everyone, and Sony will continue to offer set-top WebTV boxes even after it incorporates the technology into some of its traditional TV sets.<BR><BR>"Technologies take a lot of time to roll out and get established," said Yankowski. "Convergence is our core strategy at Sony."<BR><BR>Firestone of IBM said convergence products are already on retailers' shelves and in consumers' homes. "Have you been to your microwave lately, your refrigerator lately, or your car lately?" he asked. "There's tremendous computing power in the home already."<BR><BR>Sony chose to go high-end with its DVD launch because the company has learned there is definitely a high-end/low-end market segmentation, Yankowski said. "If there's a value proposition, people will pay a premium. The key is, does this product help the way [consumers] learn and play?"<BR><BR>All three manufacturers agreed that convergence does not mean loading products up with as many features as possible, as many PC companies are doing. Instead, they said, technology should be transparent to the consumer.<BR><BR>"We're charging down a road where we're trying to put everything into this package," Firestone said. "More and more solutions for the home will be bought in components, bit by bit."
