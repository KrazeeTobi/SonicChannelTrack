Carriers Blur
Lines Between
Cellular, PCS

</b></font></center><br>


Traditional cellular carriers, even those that are involved in PCS launches of their own, are intent on erasing the lines between PCS and cellular. It's a matter of frequency, they say, and consumers don't care about the nuts and bolts of their wireless services.
<BR><BR>"We're trying to blur the distinction between PCS and cellular," says Trent McGuire, a spokesperson with AT&T Wireless. "Our view is call it all cellular or call it all PCS. We don't want consumers thinking that they're getting a bum deal at 850 Mhz."AT&T Wireless rolled out 850 Mhz digital cellular on its entire system   40 major markets   in early October.
<BR><BR>"We have the same features on 850 as we will with 1900 Mhz," McGuire says. AT&T also plans to roll out 1900 Mhz service in 23 markets by the end of  1997. AT&T is also pushing the TDMA technology of its digital networks. "TDMA has been in operation since early 1993. With CDMA technology, you only have coverage where there is CDMA coverage," McGuire says.
<BR><BR>Dual-mode phones   capable of communicating on both analog and digital networks   combine the sexy features of digital PCS with the roaming capability of traditional cellular.
<BR><BR>AT&T's launch of  digital cellular steals some of the thunder from PCS, according to Zweig. "The initial uniqueness of that product has been diminished," she says. The most aggressive PCS launch belongs to PrimeCo, the joint venture involving Bell Atlantic/Nynex, Airtouch and Western Wireless. In November, PrimeCo rolled out networks in Texas, Florida and Virginia, along with Chicago, Milwaukee and New Orleans.
<BR><BR>PrimeCo now sells PCS through its own stores, as well as through general retailers, including Circuit City, Office Depot, Best Buy, Computer City, Wolf Camera & Video"We want to be available to the customer however they want to buy," says Allen Bourne, PrimeCo's distribution channels director.
<BR><BR>PrimeCo isn't calling their product PCS, either. "We're introducing it as a new wireless phone service, with a number of new features," Bourne says. "We like to position it as wireless the way it should be."
<BR><BR>Bourne says PrimeCo is pushing the PCS as an easier way for consumers to get into wireless communication. "We're highlighting the simplified billing, with only two rate plans," he says. "That's one of the things that have turned off may prospective wireless customers ever since the advent of cellular."
<BR><BR>PrimeCo currently has the country's only CDMA networks, so roaming is limited to the PrimeCo coverage areas. "We expect roaming capabilities as others come on line," Bourne says.
<BR><BR>Though Airtouch is one of the PrimeCo partners, the company is still touting the strengths of cellular."There's a lot of confusion in the marketplace right now," says Amy Damianakes, an Airtouch spokesperson. "PCS players are taking the approach that it's going to obsolete cellular."
<BR><BR>Not true, she says, "PCS, because it is digital, has some capabilities that go beyond what analog cellular has. But digital cellular and PCS are kissing cousins."
<BR><BR>AirTouch, which just went on-line with digital cellular in Los Angeles, isn't selling digital through general retail yet, choosing direct sales to move high-usage customers over from the analog network."With the beginning of year, we'll broaden that distribution," Damianakes says.
