Audio/Video Notes From Show Floor


</b></font></center><br>

* Sansui will hold a drawing for a $1,000 gold nugget at booth 1432 today. Only dealers and reps are eligible.<BR><BR>* Cerwin-Vega has introduced its first two home theater speaker packages to incorporate all speakers in one carton, and the company said it hopes in June to introduce home theater packages that will incorporate its first Cerwin-Vega-brand receivers. The speaker-only packages are expected to retail for $499 and $699 on promotion. Cerwin-Vega has also introduced new speaker lines that depart cosmetically from the company's traditional boxy design.<BR><BR>* Sherwood has announced a $1,299 suggested retail on the industry's first receiver to incorporate both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround technologies. It is due in the third quarter.<BR><BR>* Pacific Microsonics says introductions being made here at the Winter CES increase to 80 the number of CD players equipped with the company's audio-enhancing High Definition Compatible Digital system. Initial introductions are being made by Krell and Ultimate Technology, which join 14 manufacturers that are adding to their lines. Top record companies are now issuing HDCD recordings, and Pacific Microsonics estimates more than 1,000 titles will be on the market by the end of this year.<BR><BR>* By Christmas, Mission and Wharfedale plan to market speakers incorporating flat-panel technology developed by sister company NXT, said Farad Azima, chairman of the Verity Group, parent of all three companies. NXT is demonstrating the technology offsite to potential licensees.<BR><BR>* QSound Labs, the developer of the two-channel stereo-enhancement system that produces surround sound has broken out of its licensing mode and now is offering complete audio products of its own. Its opening line includes three models, one each for multimedia, home and auto application. The UltraQ, at $99.95 suggested retail, is a PC peripheral that fits between the computer and its speakers to deliver surround. The acQsonic, at $249, is an enhancer for home audio components. Enhancement for car stereo is provided by the Road Killer Q at $219.95. QSound is demonstrating here at WCES in a Hilton Hotel suite.<BR><BR>* Proton is showing here a set-top Internet access device called Xavier, which was designed to Oracle's Network Computer specifications. The set top will be bundled with a wireless keyboard, remote, joystick and printer port for a $500 estimated retail price. It is designed for connection to either a VGA computer monitor or a standard NTSC-interlaced TV set. The design will allow the Xavier to be used for home or business use. William Tovatt, Proton sales and market VP, said the company will be expanding its distribution to market the product.
