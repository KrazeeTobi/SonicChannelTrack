First Wave Of Network Computers<BR>
May Change Nature Of Industry

</b></font></center><br>


The Internet is not only changing the face of business, but the very nature of computing itself. Nowhere is that change more evident than in the arrival of the first wave of inexpensive network computers (NCs), which provide home and business users with direct access to the Internet, the World Wide Web, or a corporate Intranets, using conventional interlaced TV monitors as displays.
<BR><BR>The coming months will bring an outpouring of new NCs (also known as Web PCs, thin-client PCs, and Internet appliances) from major consumer electronics and computer manufacturers. Philips Magnavox and Sony are first out of the gate with set-top boxes developed under license from Palo Alto, CA-based startup WebTV Networks. With suggested retail prices of $329 for Philips' WebTV Internet Unit and $349 for Sony's WebTV Internet Terminal, the devices offer users unlimited access to the Internet via their TVs and a 33Kbps modem for a monthly subscription fee of under $30 from WebTV Networks.
<BR><BR>"With the TV as our focal point, we developed a system that doesn't compromise in meeting our customers' needs," says Bruce Leak, WebTV Networks' COO and executive VP of engineering. "It is easy to use, it includes powerful multimedia technology which makes it as natural as watching TV, and it enables people to deal with information in a personal, relevant way."
<BR><BR>WebTV supports up to five users per household. Each account is protected by a PIN number and has a personal Internet e-mail address, favorites list, and customized settings. Parental control options utilizing SurfWatch software are available for children's accounts, enabling parents to block children's access to inappropriate content and e-mail from strangers.
<BR><BR>According to WebTV Networks, the set-top box checks for software updates each time it connects to the server. When new software is released, the device is automatically updated, keeping users current with the latest trends in Internet technology.
<BR><BR>At the same time, several other prominent consumer electronics manufacturers have joined in hardware partnerships with Network Computer Inc. (NCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle Corp., based in Redwood Shores, CA. (Oracle's president Larry Ellison was among the first to champion the cause of the NC when he outlined the company's plans to develop a $500 Internet computer last year).
<BR><BR>Among the ranks in the NCI camp are Thomson Consumer Electronics, which has announced it will introduce an RCA-branded $300-retail set-top box this spring. Thomson is also in the unique position of eventually bolstering its NC product with satellite-delivered services via DSS.
<BR><BR>"As this product evolves we envision an entire family of products that merge the capabilities for Internet access with the entertainment values of such products as the Digital Satellite System and the DVD player," says Louis Lenzi, Thomson's multimedia products and services VP. "Movies, sports, and entertainment channels will be available along with Internet activities, all from a single consumer-friendly device linked to the family TV."
<BR><BR>Thomson has also formed an alliance with Compaq Computer Corp. to create a PC/TV convergence product that combines a 36-inch RCA color TV with a fully loaded personal computer to be introduced later this year.
<BR><BR>Another NCI partner, Proton USA, plans to begin production of its Xavier NC in the first quarter of this year. Based on Oracle's hardware architecture and UNIX operating system, the five-pound Xavier will utilize a 40MHz RISC multimedia processor, 4MB DRAM, 4MB of flash RAM, and either a 33.6 modem or 10BaseT Ethernet adapter at a suggested retail price of under $500 (Internet access will be provided via Proton's ProNet Internet Service on a $19.95/monthly subscription basis). Proton also plans to offer three NCTV models, with the Xavier NC component built in to the company's 35-inch, 31-inch, and 27-inch monitor/receivers.
<BR><BR>Other companies united under the NCI banner include: Acorn Computer Group, which is presently delivering its Acorn Network Computer to corporate users in Europe for under $400 (in volume shipments); Akai Digital, which plans to ship its $349 suggested retail Akai Internet Computer to home users in the first quarter; Funai Electric Co. Ltd., whose JANESA NC is designed for both corporate and home users and priced under $500; IDEA, which is presently shipping its Internet Client Station, an NC developed to address corporate users' needs for terminal replacement, multi-tier client/server transactions, and office automation at prices starting at $500 per station; and Uniden, which plans to introduce a consumer-oriented NC later this year.
<BR><BR>For the time being at least, the major computer vendors, including Corel, IBM, and Sun Microsystems, appear to be targeting their NC efforts at corporate users. IBM's Network Station, for instance, will be able access groupware over a corporate intranet and will be based on IBMs PowerPC processor with 8MB or RAM and no monitor at a price of about $695.
<BR><BR>In a speech at Comdex this past November, IBM chairman Lou Gerstner gave his blessings to the NC concept, saying: "Few users care where the processing, storage, and data exchange take place, whether it's in a tin box or anywhere. We think there will be a growing shift to this. It will be an evolution from the full-scale PC."
<BR><BR>Even Microsoft CEO Bill Gates has backed off from his initial skepticism of the NC concept. Although Gates remarked in early 1996 that competitors' support for the stripped-down computers was like "telling everyone to ride the bus," Microsoft recently announced a partnership with Intel to create an under-$1,000 NetPC. The Net PC will use Intel processors running at a minimum of 100MHz, standard components (including hard disks, which are not found on most NCs), and, it is presumed, a new Microsoft-designed operating system designed to lower administration costs.
<BR><BR>A recent study by the market research firm Yankelovich Partners Inc. seems to bear out manufacturers' high expectations for the NC. According to the study, 52% of respondents said they would prefer to use TV Internet access, compared to only 31% who chose a computer.
<BR><BR>The study also found that although approximately 35% of U.S. homes have a personal computer, only 10% take advantage of online services.
<BR><BR>"Consumer receptivity to television Internet access is surprisingly strong," says Hal Quinley, a partner at the firm. Close to 70% of those surveyed looked favorably upon the emergence of an easier, more affordable alternative to Internet which is delivered on television sets.
<BR><BR>Critics point out that the NC is far more limited in its capabilities than a full-fledged PC, and that remote delivery of services can be severely hampered by server crashes and system slowdowns due to heavy online traffic. The quality of content provided for NCs by the online services is another unproven quantity in the equation as well.
<BR><BR>"The winner in the war for eyeballs will be determined by what we can do to endow these platforms with interactive and life-like experiences," said Intel CEO Andy Grove at a news conference following his Comdex keynote address. "The sufficient condition for success is interactivity and two-way communications, and I think that the PC architecture is just better suited to that than the TV."
<BR><BR>Whether the NC turns out to be the ubiquitous set-top box envisioned by futureologists and electronics manufacturers alike, or a return engagement for the dumb terminals once popular in office environments, remains to be seen. In either case, consumers will soon be surfing a lot more than 500 channels on their TVs.
