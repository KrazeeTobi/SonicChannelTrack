Simple Pricing, Wireless Growth Spurs PCS

</b></font></center><br>

Simple pricing plans and booming wireless usage among consumers have helped boost the launch of PCS systems, according to a panel discussion among carriers. The panel discussion, moderated by TWICE senior editor Joseph Palenchar, included executives from PrimeCo, AT&T Wireless, Western Wireless and Pacific Bell.<BR><BR>In markets where both PCS and cellular are offered, both services continue to enjoy growth, said Peter Nighswander, director of PCS and wireless local loop industry research with MTA/EMCI. However, he said, "whether it's competitive or complementary has yet to be seen."<BR><BR>By the end of 1996, nine PCS carriers had signed up about 450,000 subscribers, according to Nighswander. That impressive growth, just 14 months after the nation's first PCS network went online, is a result of greater usage among consumers, he said. <BR><BR>In 1991, consumers accounted for 42% of wireless usage. Today, the consumer share is about 64%, according to Nighswander. "There's a much greater reliance on the mass merchants," he said, "it's a cash-and-carry market."<BR><BR>Daryl Newman, director of indirect distribution at PCS carrier PrimeCo, said the company sought to set itself apart from cellular carriers through simpler pricing plans.<BR><BR>PrimeCo offers two pricing plans, each with rates for in-state and out-of-state calls. "We had to simplify to get into mass distribution," Newman said.<BR><BR>PrimeCo's distribution network includes 35 company stores, which Newman said were necessary to establish the brand name among consumers.<BR><BR>Pacific Bell, which offers PCS service in California and Nevada, has become the top choice for new subscribers in those markets, said Terry Valeski, marketing and business development VP for Pacific Bell Mobile Services.<BR><BR>Pacific Bell rolled out its PCS network as quickly as possible, Valeski said, because "it's going to be very difficult to be fifth or sixth in a marketplace."<BR><BR>Broad distribution is the key to a successful PCS rollout, Valeski said. Sixty days into the launch, Pacific Bell is selling office stores, mass merchants and CE stores, he said, and "each channel has been very successful."<BR><BR>By not requiring long-term contracts and activation fees, PCS carriers have been able to move away from the phone giveaways that have become standard in cellular. "Customers are willing to pay for the phones," said Valeski. "It's our job to let them do that by providing the value to justify the purchase."<BR><BR>Western Wireless, which offers cellular service under the Cellular One name and PCS under the VoiceStream name, said the two services complement one another and extend the carrier's coverage.<BR><BR>In those Western states where VoiceStream has rolled out, the reaction from cellular carriers has been swift, Dotson said, "there's been a strong, strong push from cellular, locking up distribution and getting long-term contracts with subscribers."<BR><BR>AT&T Wireless is positioning PCS and cellular as complementary services, said Frank Kemery, senior product manager for the corporate marketing group.<BR><BR>"We see PCS as another evolutionary step in wireless communication," Kemery said. And as AT&T rolls out its digital cellular networks, the lines are blurring between PCS and cellular, and dual-mode, dual-band phones will allow users to roam from digital to analog networks.
