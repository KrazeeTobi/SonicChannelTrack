Leading Computer, Game Execs<BR>
Forecast '97 Market Trends

</b></font></center><br>



As the industry embarks on a new year of exciting activity, TWICE CES Daily gathered comments from a number of leading computer and video game executives to forecast what they see as the biggest challenges and opportunities facing the industry and/or their company in 1997. Here's what they had to say:
<BR><BR>
Dr. Andrew S. Grove<BR>
President/CEO<BR>
Intel<BR><BR>
The challenges that face us in delivering on [our] technology are to make our microprocessors faster, smaller and cheaper. The economics of our industry only work if we have large numbers of users demanding our technology. Consumers drive our industry now. They demand the highest performance and leading edge technologies. They are the early adopters of the latest in multimedia, Internet and communications.
<BR><BR>We need to be as relentless in our concern and efforts to grow the number of users and uses of our technology as we are in our efforts to develop and build the technology. Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today. We need to look outside our own backyard for new users. We need to broaden our thinking about what it is we do and how we do it.
<BR><BR>There are things that future consumers of PCs want. Expectations of what their visual experience should be that have developed over the past 50 years. These expectations are clearly shaped by the television. We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time. That competition is the TV. Consider that there are only about 1/3 as many PCs as TVs installed worldwide. While new PCs outship new TVs on a worldwide basis, we still have a long way to go before we win this "war for eyeballs." In this war, "He who captures the most eyeballs wins." This rule applies to the Internet, and it applies to consumers' minds and the time they spend on their PCs.
<BR><BR>In our battle for eyeballs, users experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing   it must exceed them. [The] PC user wants more than ever before in the history of our industry. And the PC can meet their demand for real-world, interactive, three-dimensional and lifelike experiences. I am convinced that we can do it. After all, in just four years, we went from "postage stamp" video to broadcast quality. And the platform will continue to evolve from the connected PC of the mid-90s to the visual computing platform on the late 90s.
<BR><BR>The focus will be on improving the PC experience at the same relentless pace the PC industry has pushed all other boundaries of new technology. By the end of the decade the definition of a personal computer will broaden again to include interactive, lifelike experiences as part of the standard platform.
<BR><BR>To drive such an effort, we need to look at our business as more than simply the building and selling of personal computers. Our business is the delivery of information and lifelike interactive experiences. By redefining our views and the way we think of ourselves, we will be better equipped to deal with the future of our ever changing, ever-evolving industry and to make the next 25 years as productive, exciting and rewarding as our first 25.

<BR><BR>James Corcoran<BR>
 General Manager, Segment and Solutions Marketing<BR>
IBM Consumer Division<BR><BR>
The biggest challenge facing our industry in 1997 is to create and convey (in a simple-to-understand way) a vision for how home technologies will evolve, and the role that the PC will play. Critical to this is an ability to understand "real customer needs' and intersect them with new technology developments.
<BR><BR>By being more customer-centric and solutions-oriented, we will in 1997 more effectively leverage our core computing competencies with existing and emerging digital home technologies. We will pursue these new opportunities with two main priorities in mind: creating solutions that are important and valued by consumers, and building a technology foundation that will support IBM's home networking vision.
<BR><BR>Our biggest challenges in this arena will come from consumer electronics suppliers that are entering the home computing market. We will also continue to be challenged by strong competitor price actions and business practices.
<BR><BR>Overall, IBM's Consumer Division views 1997 as an opportunity to build on our recent Aptiva successes and strengthen our position as a leading player in the consumer market.  To this end, our priority will be to build strong relationships between individual consumers, our channel partners, and the IBM brand.
<BR><BR>We will also continue to aggressively expand into complementary businesses, such as educational and enhanced learning software, by pursuing strategic relationships and new business investments.

<BR><BR>Peter Main<BR>
 Executive VP, Sales and Marketing<BR>
Nintendo of America<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>For Nintendo of America, 1997 marks a distinct change in both challenge and opportunity. Fopr the past several years, we've had to convince our players that there was, indeed, a superior game experience awaiting them with Nintendo 64. Apparently, a lot of them believed us because our singular challenge in the opening weeks of 1997 is making sure we can deliver enough machines to retail to meet demand.
<BR><BR>In a larger sense, Nintendo's goal is to expand the undisputed market leadership we asserted by year-end 1996: number one among next-generation machines, 16-bit machines and handheld machines; number one seller of video game software; and the leader in total video game revenues.
<BR><BR>As an industry, our collective challenge is to reverse the revenue declines of 1994 and 1995 and take the strong momentum built at the end of 1996 and carry it over throughout the new year. The key to that, I believe, is clear: each of the major players has now launched the hardware system that will propel it for several years, so the deciding factor in virtually every upcoming indutry battles will be software.
<BR><BR>Although much media attention will continue to be devoted to on-line applications, peripherals and the like, the winners will still be those who can develop and market the games that the nation's 13-year-olds decide they just can't live without. Those developers who figure out how to couple high-quality game play with the daunting new demands of three-dimensional programming will be handsomely rewarded; those who fail will at a minimum suffer   and many more will disappear.
<BR><BR>Indeed, 1997 may come to be seen as "the best of times." In aggregate, the future is bright as the graphical impact of the best new games is attracting a growing player demographic, and creating the highest level of excitement we've experienced in years.

<BR><BR>Ted Hoff<BR>
 Executive VP, Sales & Marketing<BR>
Sega of America<BR><BR>
There are three fundamental challenges facing the video game industry in 1997: one, maintaining the momentum we experienced this holiday season; two, ushering in the convergence of functionality and technology; and three, making on-line console gaming a reality.
<BR><BR>For next-generation consoles to reach the level of consumer acceptance enjoyed by the 16-bit predecessors, they will have to deliver impressive gameplay at mass market prices. Software developers are just now understanding how best to utilize the technology in advanced gaming hardware.
<BR><BR>I believe 1997 will be the year the industry will start to see real differentiation in gaming experiences among the next generation game consoles.  New gaming experiences and strong consumer incentives will help this business double in size in 1997.
<BR><BR>The convergence of gaming and online access through video game consoles presents both technical challenges and market growth opportunities. Research shows that 61% of console gamers want Internet access through their game systems. This merger of media is just the first step in a bigger convergence of entertainment elements all fed by the same black box. The video game business has the opportunity to become the crossroads for many different entertainment options on one box that could grow the user base in this business by up to five times its current size.
<BR><BR>Sega's first step toward this convergence is the Sega Saturn Net Link, which will allow for console-style on-line gaming in early 1997.  Our goal is to expand the realm of on-line games beyond PC-based, first-person perspective  Doom<BR>-style games. Sega will deliver 3D, arcade-action gaming to the on-line arena, which will demonstrate a new capability in the on-line games category and bring new consumers to the business.

<BR><BR>Jim DeRose<BR>
 President<BR>
Acclaim North American Operations,<BR>
Acclaim Entertainment<BR><BR>
Acclaim Entertainment is in a good position to move forward in a positive fashion, and we continue as a strong, global entity in the entertainment software industry, which is clearly showing signs of revitalization.  
<BR><BR>Yes, we faced a difficult year, transitioning from an entrepreneurial operation to the more traditional corporate disciplines required by a company of our size and complexity. This transition was compounded by the turmoil within our industry as the 16-bit business waned and new, 32- and 64-bit platforms emerged.
<BR><BR>It is now our challenge to create excellent games that demonstrate to our customers, our shareholders and our competitors that we continue as a major player in the interactive entertainment industry.
<BR><BR>Three factors, in particular, will contribute to our successful future.  They are: one, organizational and operational changes that we have made to favorably impact our business and our financial performance; two, Acclaim's investments of the past 17 months   in development studios, our comics company and our coin-operated entertainment unit   that are beginning to yield immediate and long-term returns; and three, the strength of our product line for fiscal '97   our stable of key franchises and new titles   to enable us to re-establish our leadership post.
<BR><BR>We are firmly committed to continuing our substantial investments in R&D, product development and product acquisition to maintain a steady flow of high-quality console and PC games, with the majority of our product now coming from our own, internal studios and not from outside developers.
<BR><BR>Our focus is on doing "fewer things better" and obtaining optimal sell-through from each title we market. As we did recently with  Turok: Dinosaur Hunter,<BR> we will delay a product release if necessary to ensure the most exciting gameplay. In doing so, we are confidant we will sell more units per title and improve our earnings, accordingly.

<BR><BR>Robert A. Kotick<BR>
 Chairman and CEO<BR>
Activision<BR><BR>
1996 was a year of profound changes in the entertainment software industry. Strong hardware sales for both personal computers, as well as next generation video game consoles, resulted in overall market growth in dollars and substantial growth in unit sales   particularly CD-ROM units   as price pressure accelerated.
<BR><BR>In 1997, we believe entertainment software publishers are going to face perhaps the greatest challenges seen since the mid 1980's.
<BR><BR>While there has been continued talk of consolidation, most of the consolidation that has taken place to date has been of troubled companies merging, selling, or exiting the business. The few well-positioned companies have chosen to focus on improving operating performance through higher quality production, international and platform expansion and more efficient distribution.
<BR><BR>Over the past year, the landscape of opportunity has changed. Therefore, small publishers will have to affiliate with larger publishers or risk elimination. Development talent is scarce and the highest quality third-party developers are affiliating themselves with the publishers who are well-capitalized and marketing savvy. Less capital will be deployed to make titles than in previous years, which may result in fewer titles and a more orderly retail marketplace.
<BR><BR>The Internet is providing exciting new opportunities for interactive entertainment, both from a content as well as distribution standpoint. Additionally, sales of Sony PlayStations and Nintendo 64s are creating an entirely new   and large   installed base for console games.
<BR><BR>With all this activity in the marketplace, the fundamentals for success remain unchanged. Activision continues to develop high-quality titles for the most popular platforms, based on proven franchises that we own or control.
<BR><BR>In 1997, our continued growth will come from increased product flow, corporate acquisitions and/or mergers and international expansion. We are using newly available Internet-based marketing tools to promote trial and sampling of our products prior to purchase, evangelize our products prior to release and develop even closer relationships with our core customers.
<BR><BR>As one of the few profitable, public interactive entertainment companies, we expect to be able to leverage our financial strength, our high-quality management team and well developed organizational infrastructure to grow our market share in both the desktop and set top markets this year.

<BR><BR>Karen Steinwach<BR>
 VP of Marketing<BR>
Transmonde Technologies<BR><BR>
Managing technology is the biggest challenge facing the computer industry. Basically, our industry is on a 3-3-1 cycle; three months development, three month product life, one month to kill it. Although the new technology continues to allow us to do more, faster, this frenetic pace challenges all vendors when considering quality, design and support.
<BR><BR>Anothet key issue is financial health. Manufacturers, retailers and dealers are all operating on razor thin margins. Obviously, the good side of this is that the constant price wars are allowing more folks to be able to afford computers. But, we do need a healthy industry to provide good
support and to fund future innovation.
<BR><BR>On the flip side of the above, I still think PC's are too expensive for most families, and unfortunately, a lot of schools. And as they become an increasingly important tool in society, we have to find a way to provide computing ability to those   like schools and kids   who need it.
<BR><BR>As for the biggest opportunities, the real issue is not about "computing"   it's access to knowledge and information. That sounds like a cliche, but I think the Internet, especially, will become the new Automatic Teller Machine (Imagine living without the cash machine!). The ability to jump on the internet and research from many different avenues is fantastic.  And much of the multimedia software being produced is just excellent. This all provides a learning experience for everyone that is unparalleled   and global!
<BR><BR>Will it be a PC? Will it be a Network Computer? WebTV?  Whatever device is ultimately chosen, we need to understand that our industry doesn't sell "boxes," we sell access, and it's not the feature that's important, it's the benefit.
<BR><BR>I think that improving "usability" is a huge opportunity. We still have a long way to go to make PCs intuitive and easy to use. This is especially true in the home, but also in small- to medium-size businesses. Not everyone has an in-home computer geek or an MIS department!
<BR><BR>You are also starting to see increased consumerization of the PC, with cool new desktop designs, experimentation with new colors, and of course portability! The PC is becoming more personal.

<BR><BR>Mike Culver<BR>
 VP & General Manager<BR>
Acer America, Consumer Division<BR><BR>
There are two major challenges facing personal computer manufacturers operating in the retail PC space in 1997. Specifically, how companies manage their business in a slow-growth or no growth market. Very few of the leading PC manufacturers are accustomed to conducting business in this type of environment, so learning to effectively balance and manage inventories will be a challenge for everyone. Manufacturers who carefully manage inventories both internally and in the channel will succeed in this volatile market.
<BR><BR>Secondly, there will be fewer storefronts selling PCs in 1997. Continued consolidation of major retailers will result in the elimination of less profitable stores, ultimately with fewer stores actually selling PCs.
<BR><BR>The biggest challenge facing Acer America in the coming year relates to our ability to effectively manage product inventory levels to coincide with increases or decreases in market demand.  There are definitely opportunities for growth, but Acer's outlook is relatively conservative in the coming months.
<BR><BR>Acer clearly views the notebook market as area of tremendous opportunity in the coming year.  Acer will focus heavily on this product segment, but continue to emphasize consumer desktops and commercial systems.
<BR><BR>From an industry perspective, DVD and Intel's MMX technology are exciting technologies that will stimulate consumer interest and demand for new PCs.  Overall, 1997 will be a challenging, but exciting year in the PC marketplace.

<BR><BR>Brian Fargo<BR>
President<BR>
Interplay Productions<BR><BR>
Ironically, both the biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity lie with online gaming. There has been a dramatic shift in the way gamers spend their time these days. As a challenge, we have gamers instead spending 200-plus hours playing a single product, like Descent or Warcraft, over the Internet. Those same hours would have been spent playing or purchasing other games a year ago. I really don't think publishers have realized this issue and come to grips with it. I believe it imperative to create a way to generate revenues from the whole online field. Interplay's strategy is to utilize Engage as our business model.
<BR><BR>That said, I believe there is tremendous opportunity for online games, assuming the model isn't that it is given away for free. We already know that playing games online is infinitely fun and infinitely replayable, so we aren't guessing whether it might be a good idea. I know I've stayed up till 2 a.m. playing games when I know I should have been going to sleep. Rarely does a TV program ever compel me to do that kind of thing. It's also good news that the content is often so large that we must have a retail CD to deliver the data, so we should continue to have a strong retail business for such titles.
<BR><BR>Also, as an industry we finally have a chance to really<BR>reach the mass market by the fact that on-line is so accessible to anyone.
<BR><BR>On-line games are exciting, replayable, easily accessed and clearly the future   we just need to find models that allow software publishers to share in the revenues so we can create bigger and better games.
