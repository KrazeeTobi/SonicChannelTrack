Audio Manufacturers Talk About DVD Audio Standards


</b></font></center><br>

It will be another six months to a year before the music and electronics industries agree on a DVD music disc standard, and it will take another one to one-and-a-half years before the first prototype DVD music players are unveiled, retailers were told during a seminar at the Alexis Park hotel.<BR><BR>The comments were made by Sony's David Kawakami, who is a member of the DVD consortium's working group on music DVD.<BR><BR>Kawakami also expressed optimism that the electronics industry would be able to meet a key music-industry requirement: that DVD music discs be playable on existing CD players. "The music industry has asked for two-layer discs, one with Redbook CD audio and one with DVD audio," he explained. <BR><BR>Calling the request a "very smart requirement," Kawakami nonetheless noted that "it is a difficult requirement to comply with [in the disc replication process]," but he noted that Sony and Philips "have done R&D on this" in the past and that "we think we can do it in a cost-effective way."<BR><BR>In other comments, Kawakami said he believes "there is little danger" that compressed audio will become a DVD standard because the music industry is very "talent-driven" and that artists and producers "are insatiable in terms of the quality of the tools they want to work with."<BR><BR>Other music-industry requirements include copyright protection and multichannel capability.
