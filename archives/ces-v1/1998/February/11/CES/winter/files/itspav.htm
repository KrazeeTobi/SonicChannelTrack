<center><font size=4><b>ITS Pavilion Planned for 1997 Winter CES<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup></b></font></center><P>

ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, May 31, 1996.  With 83 percent of Americans making 
at least one "road trip" of 100 miles or more each year, Intelligent 
Transportation System (ITS) products have a ready-made market.  A special 
ITS Pavilion to help mobile electronics retailers take advantage of this 
growing market is set for the 1997 International Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="1">&#174;</font></sup>) in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 9-12.  Located 
within the Sands Expo & Convention Center, the third annual showcase will 
house several manufacturers within 2,000 net square feet.  The ITS 
Pavilion was first introduced at the 1995 Winter CES.  
<P>
The ITS Pavilion educates retailers about new potential mobile growth 
areas within the ITS field.  The Pavilion also allows manufacturers -- 
especially OEMs, smaller companies, and young ITS product divisions at 
large corporations -- to get their feet wet in marketing their ITS 
products at Winter CES without the financial and logistical obligations 
of launching a full product line and booth.  Last year's participants 
included Delco Electronics, Etak Inc., ITS America, Magneti Marelli, 
Navigation Technologies, POIS, Rockwell Automotive and Siemens 
Automotive.  
<P>
Out of 27,000 buyers surveyed during last year's Winter CES, 13 percent 
indicated that they were interested in ITS-type products.  Manufacturers 
who wish to participate in the 1997 Pavilion should contact Kirk 
Smallwood of CES, tel: 703-907-7606, fax: 703-907-7691.  The exhibit 
space cost of  $4,100 per 100 net square feet includes a pre-fabricated 
booth set-up that requires minimal planning and effort on the part of the 
exhibitor.
<P>
"We were extremely pleased with the 1996 Winter CES in general and with 
the ITS Pavilion in particular.  We plan on being part of the 1997 
Pavilion as well," said Thomas P. Theisen, product line manager, 
navigation systems for Rockwell Automotive's Driver Information Systems 
business.  "Participating in the ITS Pavilion provided us with increased 
visibility and booth traffic, which was critical to Rockwell.  We used 
the show to meet with potential distributors and retailers of The 
PathMasterTM System, our premium turn-by-turn route guidance and 
information system.  The ITS Pavilion attracted the kind of visitors to 
our booth that we wanted to meet."
<P>
ITS products are designed to improve passenger and freight efficiency and 
safety along surface transportation modes.  ITS America hopes to make ITS 
technologies available to all consumers of passenger and freight 
transportation within five years.  
<P>
More than half of Americans are aware that ITS car navigation systems are 
now available for purchase, according to a recent survey by the Consumer 
Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA).  And, more importantly, 
almost 20 percent of those surveyed would like to purchase some type of 
car navigation system.
<P>
State-of-the-art ITS navigation systems use Global Positioning System 
(GPS) satellites to identify vehicle locations, plus sophisticated 
mapping software and databases to show a driver where his/her car is in 
relation to its destination.  Depending on the system, the software can 
identify such landmarks as surrounding highways and local roads, 
airports, parks, restaurants, specific addresses and more.  Drivers can 
use the software to plan their routes, tour familiar sites, locate new 
addresses and plan their trips as they go.
