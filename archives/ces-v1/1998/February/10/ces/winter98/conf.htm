Over 81 percent of the consumers with a multimedia computer have a system featuring a 486-level, Pentium, or Pentium-Pro processor, compared to just 3 percent with the 386-level computer, which was the original multimedia PC standard of just 5 years ago.  What does this all mean to your business?  What distribution channels are changing with new technology?  Where will new technology growth lead you?  Join any of the below Home Computing sessions to learn more and answer your questions.
