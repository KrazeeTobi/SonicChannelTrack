A bundle of advanced systems and services exist for new homes, both multi-unit and single family. Understanding what consumers want, what they can afford, how they make their choices, and which systems to deploy is the first challenge. The second is choosing products and services that match the needs of your target markets. Join us for this session from key builders who are using technology to create competitive advantage. Hear their views on trends, consumer reactions, risks, opportunities, and perhaps most importantly, what they need from manufacturers and service providers to help them make their decisions and then market their innovations.
