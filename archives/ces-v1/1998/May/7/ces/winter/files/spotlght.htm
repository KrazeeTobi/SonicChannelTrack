<br><br>
 

ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, October 25, 1996.  The neon lights of Las Vegas will 
be shining on the fast-growing home systems industry at the 1997 
International Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup>), January 9-12, 
1997.  Home systems exhibits will be placed alongside home theater and 
multi-room entertainment exhibits at the Las Vegas Hilton, one of the 
four CES facilities -- the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), Sands Expo 
and Convention Center, and Alexis Park Hotel are the others.  Some home 
control products will be displayed at the LVCC.      
<br><Br>
Show management -- the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association 
(CEMA) -- expects to attract over 80,000 attendees to Winter CES, making 
it the world's largest event showcasing consumer electronics products, 
including integrated home systems technology.  Currently, the square 
footage of home systems exhibits at the 1997 Winter CES is double that of 
the '96 Show.
<br><Br>
"For suppliers of home controls and services, Winter CES will offer a 
targeted audience of tens of thousands of installers, integrators, 
contractors, and retailers," said Robbi Lycett, Winter CES Show Director. 
 "This year at the Hilton, CES is promoting the growing synergy of custom 
home theater products into integrated home systems by providing a 
one-stop venue to see these fast-growing products and services."
<br><Br>
Independent research indicates that 55 percent of polled 1996 Winter CES 
attendees are interested in home systems products and services.

Exhibitors Enthusiastic for CES 
</b><br><Br>
"We are excited to show the new RCA Home Control at Winter CES," said 
Jack Nick, Vice President, Accessories & Component Business at Thomson 
Consumer Electronics.  "Our home control product, operated by a standard 
universal remote control, starts at only $49 and can control consumer 
electronics products in the home, in addition to other electrical 
products.  By bringing the benefits of home control to the mass market, 
this product will help grow the entire home control industry, and I 
expect the CES attendees will heartily embrace this concept."     
      <br><BR>  
Will West, President of PHAST added, "Winter CES will enable us to build 
excitement around our products -- a full line of hardware and software 
which makes high-end automation truly practical.  This is an essential 
show for us because CES is a key place for all our dealers to check out 
the latest in consumer electronics." 
<br><br>
Attendees at the 1997 Winter CES will see some new companies on the 
exhibit floor.  Among the first-time CES exhibitors are: AMP, AVSI, 
Dancraft Enterprises, Diablo Research, IES Technologies, Lutron 
Electronics, and PHAST.

Lycett concluded, "We see home and building control as one of the 
fastest-growing segments of our industry.  CES' commitment to this 
product category can be seen in the significant jump in exhibit space 
alongside home theater products, a comprehensive seminar track, and a 
major effort to attract system designers, installers, integrators, and 
retailers.  Winter CES has become an invaluable showcase for the home 
systems industry."
