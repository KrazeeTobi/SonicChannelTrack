    <b>1997 Winter CES® To Bring Mobile Buyers 
    To The Sands</b></font><br><p></center><p>


For the 1997 Winter CES®, to be held January 9-12, several product 
categories have been moved to accommodate exhibitors. At the Sands, 
mobile electronics exhibitors will join cellular, paging, wireless, 
telephones and personal electronics. The mobile electronics, cellular, 
paging, wireless and telephone exhibitors will be located on the upper 
level of the Sands in halls A, B and C, while the other products will be 
on the lower level of the convention center in hall G. 
<p>
Winter CES is the largest gathering of the mobile electronics product 
category in the world. As of mid-March, more than 180 mobile electronics 
exhibitors had signed up for booth space at the Sands for 1997. A total 
of 800 consumer electronics companies had already reserved space for 
1997; almost 50 percent of those exhibitors asked for space at the Sands. 
Many prominent companies in car audio have already agreed to reserve 
booth space at the Sands, including Alpine, Audiovox, Clarion, Kenwood, 
Pioneer and Sony.
<p>
&quot;The mobile electronics industry should all pull together and make the 
Winter CES at the Sands a great show,&quot; said Loyd Ivey, MTX CEO and 
president. &quot;We [the industry] have a responsibility to make the best show 
in Las Vegas we can. MTX will go and have a great show and urge all 
others to be there and do the same. Get on the bus or get run over by the 
bus. Let's all work together to make Winter CES a great industry show.&quot;
