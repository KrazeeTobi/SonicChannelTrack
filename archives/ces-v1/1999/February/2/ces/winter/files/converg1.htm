Growth of Industry and Show Reflected in Wireless/Cellular, Satellite,<br>
Accessories and Home Systems Categories </center>

<br><br>
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, October 8, 1996.   If the science fiction writers 
scribing earlier in this century had their way, consumers would probably 
be floating in air ships, hovercrafting their way to work, and creating 
elaborate meals out of a seed the size of a speck of dust.
<br><br>
Although consumers are floating in air ships (they're called airplanes) 
and creating elaborate meals out of seemingly nothing -- thanks to 
two-family households and busy lifestyles -- they're hardly doing much 
hovercrafting.  But the very idea that anyone could accomplish the 
heretofore unimaginable -- a science fiction staple -- and create these 
previously unimaginable things is being practiced day in, day out, by the 
consumer electronics industry.
        <br><br>
At the 1997 International Winter Consumer Electronics Showr (CES<sup><font size="-1"> ® </font></sup>), being 
held in Las Vegas this coming January 9th through 12th, the convergence 
of a variety of technologies that result in the creation of products that 
enhance the quality of the lives of millions of consumers around the 
world will be in the spotlight.
<br><br>
More than 1,500 companies -- 234 new exhibitors -- are set to be in place 
exhibiting on the show floors  this coming January.  Nearly one million 
square feet of exhibit space has already been assigned.  With a focus on 
converging technology-infused products, and a wide array of manufacturers 
from the United States and such countries as France, Germany, Hong Kong, 
Israel, Italy, Korea, Nigeria, and Taiwan, the 1997 Winter CES is shaping 
up to be another strong consumer electronics showcase.
<br><br>
Also converging in Las Vegas this year is a variety of hot topics being 
addressed in a comprehensive conference program: over 50 sessions are 
being held at all four properties housing the 1997 Winter CES (the Alexis 
Park Hotel, Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), Sands Expo and Convention 
Center and the Las Vegas Hilton).  The sessions, free to all 
badged-attendees, are comprised of eight tracks.  These tracks include 
new technology, internet, multimedia, SoHo, specialty audio, mobile 
electronics, home theater and general sessions. Two other special 
six-session accredited tracks on retail management and home systems are 
available for $125 or $30 a session.
<br><br>
In addition, Michael Bloomberg, president and founder of Bloomberg 
Financial Markets, will deliver the 1997 Winter CES keynote address in 
the LVCC on January 9th, along with Bob Borchardt, president of Recoton 
and Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers 
Association (CEMA), sponsor of the CES.
<br><br>
Convergence is certainly a buzzword in today's consumer electronics 
universe.  &quot;We hear a great deal about convergence these days,&quot; says 
Shapiro.  &quot;Witness products being created for use with the Internet, such 
as PC TVs or web TVs, or for use in home offices, such as all-in-one 
fax/copier/scanner units.  'Converging technologies' are key to these and 
other products'  success.  In fact, certain products like these would not 
be possible if a variety of technologies did not converge.&quot;
<br><br>
A quick look at the names of some exhibitors showing products anchored by 
converging technologies tells the tale: Casio, Denon, Thomson, Philips, 
Pioneer, Sharp, Sony, and Thomson.  Clearly, convergence is a 1997 Winter 
CES benchmark.
<br><br>
A first-time Winter CES Emerging Technologies Pavilion, located on the 
lower level of the Sands, will zero in on the efforts of small companies 
manufacturing products infused by new and exciting technologies.  
Eligible companies are those who produce less than $2 million in revenue, 
have never had a booth larger than 10' x 10' at a CES, and have fewer 
than 15 employees.  The Pavilion is ideal for companies that are looking 
to gain exposure to nearly 80,000 financiers, investors, venture 
capitalists, retailers and trade press.  The pavilion is a veritable 
one-stop-shopping experience for 1997 Winter CES attendees.
<br><br><b>
Exhibitors Embrace Winter CES
</b><br><br>
As competition for consumers' disposable income continues to increase, it 
is becoming more important for consumer electronics manufacturers to 
target their products to the trade at the Winter CES.  Square footage for 
specific product areas is also on the upswing; most notably, gainers 
include cellular and wireless equipment, SoHo, home systems, accessories 
and satellite categories.  A steady increase is also visible in mobile 
electronics, home theater and furniture. 
<br><br>
All of this and more will be played out on the show floors in all 1997 
Winter CES properties.  Responding to changes in the consumer electronics 
marketplace, the show floors have been rearranged to serve attendees 
better.
<br><br><b>
Sands Expo and Convention Center
</b><br><br>
Much is happening at the Sands Expo and Convention Center.  Mobile 
electronics manufacturers will join those of the cellular, paging, 
wireless, telephone and personal electronics varieties there.  All but 
the personal electronics companies will be located on the hotel's upper 
level in the A, B and C halls; the rest will reside on the lower level of 
the hotel's convention center in hall G.  Over 160,000 square feet of 
mobile electronics space has been reserved.  &quot;It was important to move 
the mobile electronics exhibitors to a location that would accommodate 
this product categories' growth,&quot; says Jonathan Thompson, CES vice 
president.
<br><br>
The Winter CES is important to Earthquake Sound Corporation.  Eddie 
Chucrallah, operations manager, says the company believes &quot;that the 
Winter CES is the medium of choice to project our message to current and 
future clients.  Facing and interacting with clients on a one-to-one 
basis is very important to us -- what better way to do it than at CES.  
For us, the CES is a 'monstrous' display for new products and innovative 
ideas, whether (they are) Earthquake's or someone else's.&quot;
        <br><br>
Chucrallah also says that the benefits of the CES &quot;extend beyond the U.S. 
continent.  A large part of Earthquake's international business was 
acquired at CES, and we are 'shooting' for &#12;much more.  Earthquake runs 
massive advertisement campaigns in trade magazines, yet we always rely on 
CES to acquire more business.&quot;
<br><br>
Overall, the Sands represents more than 500,000 square feet of exhibit 
space: approximately 650 exhibitors have already been assigned space 
here.   In other words, the Sands is truly a critical mix of the show.  
In addition to substantial exhibit space, the Sands will also house 
Innovations '97, the annual showcase of design, engineering and software 
excellence in the consumer electronics marketplace.  The Innovations '97 
Design &amp; Engineering Honors Program is endorsed by the Industrial 
Designers Society of America.
<br><br>
Other key exhibitors in the Sands include cellular/wireless manufacturers 
 like Motorola (5,000 square feet), Ericsson (4,000 square feet), and 
Samsung Cellular (3,000 square feet). Nokia, PageMart, PageNet, and 
Pacific Bell Mobile Services will also be present, as well as caller ID 
manufacturers CIDCO and Colonial Data.  
<br><br>
Companies such as PageMart Wireless consider CES to be an important 
showcase for their products. &quot;The Consumer Electronics Show is one of the 
most successful trade shows we attend all year,&quot; says John D. Beletic, 
PageMart Wireless's president and CEO.  &quot;CES gives us a chance to meet 
with hundreds of buyers and resellers to discuss new products, services 
and promotions.&quot;
<br><br>
The Sands is also the home of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) 
Pavilion, which will feature products designed to improve passenger and 
freight efficiency and safety along surface transportation modes.  
There's a ready-made market for ITS products: 83 percent of Americans are 
making at least one &quot;road trip&quot; lasting 100 miles or more every year.  On 
display in this pavilion will be in-vehicle navigation systems, traveler 
information systems, safety devices, mayday and collision notification 
systems, and vehicle radar systems.  Manufacturers represented will 
include Etak, Navigation Technologies, Rockwell and Siemens.
<br><br><b>
Specialty Audio moves to the Alexis Park Hotel
</b><br><br>
There are over 200 exhibitors committed to displaying their products in 
the new home of specialty audio at the Winter CES -- the Alexis Park 
Hotel, located just under two miles from the Las Vegas Convention Center 
(shuttle buses run every 10 minutes).  The move to the Alexis Park looks 
to be a successful and lasting one, as well as a clear representation to 
the trade of  the power of specialty audio.
<br><br>
Exhibitors showing their specialty audio products at the Alexis Park will 
range from AudioQuest to Vandersteen Audio, from Krell Industries to 
Thiel, and from Martin-Logan to Mobile Fidelity.  Six conference 
sessions, part of the overall 1997 Winter CES Conference Program, will be 
held in the hotel.  The sessions include &quot;How to Introduce New People to 
Specialty Audio,&quot; &quot;The Art of Listening -- How to Conduct Listening Tests 
with Demos,&quot; and &quot;High-End Accessories -- Do They Make a Difference?&quot;
<br><br><b>
The Las Vegas Convention Center
</b><br><br>
The Winter CES's traditional audio and video exhibit areas, located in 
the LVCC, are thriving once again this year.  Sold out for the most part, 
the LVCC is packed with all manner of audio and video products (on the 
main and upper levels and in North 1 and the South 2, 3, 4 and 5 halls).
<br><br>
With the LVCC's Grand Lobby retooled to accommodate fire marshal 
restrictions, many publication and trade show booths will be scattered 
among the show properties, rather than simply reside in the Grand Lobby 
of the LVCC where they have traditionally been situated.  Although some 
will remain in the lobby this year, others will be placed by product 
category in the appropriate location.
<br><br>
On the LVCC floor, don't miss the many new and exciting products on 
display, like Microsoft's new Windows CE operating system for handheld 
personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other like 
products (look for it in the company's 1,200 square foot booth in South 
2).
<br><br>
With a wide variety of Internet-related products on the market, it might 
seem as though CES is going &quot;Internet crazy.&quot;  However, it's just 
reliable Winter CES magic, bringing manufacturers such as Hughes, Oracle, 
Philips, Sony, Thomson and Zenith together to reflect the continuing turn 
of the consumer electronics industry toward all things Internet.
<br><br>
The ever-changing worlds of multimedia and desktop publishing -- both 
ongoing centers for converging technologies -- will be on display at the 
Multimedia/Desktop Publishing Pavilion in the LVCC.  Expect to see a 
variety of multimedia hardware and accessories on view, along with 
CD-ROM-based electronic gaming and software products.
<br><br>
The 1997 Winter CES is also the premier January showcase for satellite 
products (which will be found in the LVCC).  Winter CES is clearly the 
place for satellite manufacturers to exhibit their products -- satellite 
square footage rose an incredible 1,100 percent over last year's show.   
On display will be the latest products from such companies as Echostar 
Communications, DirecTV, General Instrument and Prime Star.
<br><br>
The LVCC's North 2 hall is the main home for small office/home office, or 
SoHo, exhibits.  The SoHo offerings will come from such companies as 
Brother International, Franklin Electronic Publishers, Hewlett-Packard 
USA, Royal Consumer Business Products, and Smith Corona.
<br><br>
Tedd Rozylowicz, vice president in Sharp Electronics' Consumer Business 
Products Group, says that &quot;The Winter Consumer Electronics Show is an 
integral part of Sharp's overall marketing program.  It's our best 
opportunity to show our customers the types of products and marketing 
plans we have for the next year.  It also enables our dealers to meet 
with many
levels of our management teams in sales and marketing.&quot;
<br><br>
Furniture, the stationary anchor for most consumer electronics products, 
is making a big splash at the 1997 Winter CES in the South 1 and 2 and 
3-5 halls, with manufacturers such as Bush Industries, Gusdorf, and 
Sauder Woodworking displaying their products.
<br><br>
More LVCC excitement comes in the form of digital cameras from 
manufacturers such as Casio and Vivitar.
<br><br>
The Las Vegas Hilton is the 1997 Winter CES headquarters for home theater 
and home systems exhibitors, in which a showcase will be provided for the 
growing synergy between the two areas.  Look for a variety of exciting 
products to put a charge into the ever-important home theater sector of 
the consumer electronics industry, including those from Advanced 
Technology Group; first-time CES exhibitor Prosumer Technologies, (a new 
division of Extron Electronics being unveiled at the show); first-time 
Winter CES exhibitor THX, (which will be cross-promoting its licensees 
who are showing their products in Las Vegas); MB Quart; MTX; and Snell 
Acoustics.
<br><br>
&quot;As a new division of Extron Electronics, Prosumer Technologies sees 
Winter CES as a tremendous opportunity to publicize our new line of home 
theater products to the extensive consumer electronics market,&quot; says Gary 
Kayye, vice president, sales and marketing, Prosumer Technologies.
<br><br>
The Home Systems market, which is experiencing nearly a 70 percent 
increase at this time in square footage at the 1997 Winter CES and 
continues to grow in appeal to the retail marketplace, architects and 
custom installers, will be represented by a number of exhibitors, 
including Crestron, Lutron Electronics, Phast, and X-10 (USA).
<br><br><b>
Bringing It All Home
</b><br><br>
The 1997 Winter CES will be a classic showcase for the consumer 
electronics industry's new and existing products: from accessories and 
audio and video hardware and software to small office/home office, 
specialty audio and telephone products, Las Vegas will be the place to be 
this coming January.
<br><br>
&quot;We always say that the 'next' Winter CES will be the best ever,&quot; says 
Gary Shapiro.  &quot;But it's absolutely true.  The industry changes 
constantly, and with so many new products and trends evident on our show 
floors each year, it's important for the industry to have a regular, 
reliable showcase.   The 1997 Winter CES is the next 'best ever' showcase 
for the world of consumer electronics.  We look forward to all of the 
technologies in our rainbow, and our attendees converging on Las Vegas 
(over 80,000 retail buyers, distributors, manufacturers, market analysts, 
importers/exporters and journalists from 112 countries attended last 
year).
