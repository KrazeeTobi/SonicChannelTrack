<p>


ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, November 1, 1996.  In an effort to build booth 
traffic for mobile electronics exhibitors at the Sands Expo &amp; Convention 
Center, CES show management is adding a number of special promotions for 
the International Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>) in Las 
Vegas, January 9-12, 1997.   As of late October, requests for mobile 
electronics exhibit space were up 10 percent and requests for wireless 
communications exhibit space were up 34 percent compared to the same time 
frame for the 1996 show;  much of the allocated mobile and wireless 
exhibit space within the Sands has been sold. The Winter CES is the 
world's largest trade-only exposition for the mobile electronics 
industry.
<br><br>
CES will be giving a 1997 Ford F150 Supercab that will be outfitted with 
some of the latest mobile electronics gear to a lucky attendee at the 
Sands.  A duplicate model of the truck will also be on display at the Las 
Vegas Convention Center (LVCC).  Attendees should look for details on 
this promotional sweepstakes in December.
<br><br>
To further promote mobile electronics exhibitors at the Sands, CES is 
also teaming up with Sound Solutions to create a Mobile Electronics 
Exhibitor Information Kiosk System.  Two kiosks will be placed in 
designated areas of the LVCC and one at the Sands.  These kiosks will 
display a graphics display and booth number of each mobile electronics 
exhibitor, and exhibitors can purchase a 15 second to 30 second video 
presentation about their company or products for a minimal cost of $200.  
The kiosks will also contain details about bus schedules, conferences and 
a display of the Sands floor plan.
<br><br>
Outside of the show floor, attendees should look for additional mobile 
electronics exhibitors displaying their latest sound systems in the Sands 
parking lot.  This space has recently opened up for exhibits.  Interested 
exhibitors should contact the CES Sales Department at 703-907-7657.
<br><br>
Also in the Sands, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association 
(CEMA), the Winter CES sponsor and manager, will host an association 
booth featuring the Mobile Electronics Certification Program (MECP), 
mobile electronics market research, mobile electronics membership 
services and other products and publications for the mobile industry.
<br><br>
With vehicle navigation awareness on the rise, a special Intelligent 
Transportation Systems (ITS) Pavilion to help mobile electronics 
retailers take advantage of this growing market will be located within 
the Sands.  The pavilion allows manufacturers - especially OEMs, smaller 
companies and young ITS product divisions at large corporations -- to get 
their feet wet in marketing their ITS products at Winter CES without the 
financial and logistical obligations of launching a full product line and 
booth.  
Participants in this year's pavilion include Etak, Navigation 
Technologies, POIS, RoadTrak and Rockwell.  Interested companies should 
contact Kirk Smallwood of CES at 703-907-7606 to inquire about exhibit 
opportunities.
<br><br>
&quot;With promotions and special events such as these -- along with our other 
promotional line-up that includes targeted advertising campaigns, on-site 
banners and signage, the location of Innovations at the Sands, service 
facilities, partnership mailings and express bus shuttles -- CES show 
management has pulled out all the stops to make Winter CES the best show 
ever for mobile electronics exhibitors,&quot; said Robbi Lycett, Winter CES 
Show Director.   &quot;Winter CES has always been the largest trade-show event 
for mobile electronics and we plan to continue that tradition.&quot;
<br><br>
All profits from the Winter CES and other CES-sponsored events are 
reinvested into industry services, including the MECP, media relations 
programs, engineering standards development, market research, and 
governmental and legal affairs support as directed by CEMA.
