<img align="left" valign="top" SRC="../images/bob.gif" WIDTH="155" HEIGHT="217">Thank you Gary for the kind introduction.  I am honored to be here both
as Chair of CEMA and
as a member of the class of 1967.
<br><br>
The consumer electronics business has just ended one of the most
difficult years I can ever
remember. According to the analysts, consumers chose to use their
discretionary income this
holiday season for clothes, jewelry and toys.  Consumer electronics and
PCS suffered.  What we
all needed was an electronic Tickle Me Elmo.   
<br><br>
I am confident the future holds great promise for sales and profits to
rebound for the industry. 
How can I be so sure?  Its simple.  Consumer electronics products offer
incredible value.  What
other type of product can you think of that has steadily decreased in
price, while adding features
and benefits.  Virtually none.  
<br><br>
Over the past 10 years, the cost of housing, apparel, automobiles and
food have increased an
average of three percent annually.  On the other hand, prices of
consumer electronics products,
such as compact disc players, VCRs, camcorders and TVS have decreased by
about four percent
a year.  
<br><br>
What is amazing to me is that during this same period we have unveiled
so many great
technological and feature advancements.  For example, multi-disc CD
players, VCRs that set the
clock, picture in picture TV, wireless headphones, and Dolby Digital
receivers.  We continue to
give consumers incredible products at very affordable prices.  Value for
value you just can't beat
consumer electronics.  
<br><br>
How is this all possible?  First of all, the cost of these technologies
has decreased dramatically
over the years, so it does cost less to make many of these products. 
Secondly, both the
manufacturers and retailers are in a constant battle for market share
and keep taking drastic steps
to grow their market position.  
<br><br>
While, low prices are great for consumers, it has become detrimental to
our industry.  On the
manufacturer side we have seen layoffs, plant closings or plant sell
offs and mergers.  On the
retail side we have seen consolidation and store closings.  We must not
continue this way much
longer if we expect to grow this industry further.  An eye for an eye
leaves two blind men. 
Maybe it is time for all of us to step back and regroup.  Profitless
prosperity is not the answer.
<br><br>
There is definitely room for optimism.  The digital age is just around
the corner and I believe that
strong growth may be on the horizon.  DVD and digital television should
drive customers back
into the stores.  We have been anxiously awaiting DVD and consumers
should finally be able to
experience this outstanding technology in just a few months.  While I do
not expect DVD to be
the savior for our industry, I anticipate that it will create some
needed excitement and prompt
consumers to upgrade other components such as their televisions, audio
equipment and speakers.  
<br><br>
As an industry, it is imperative that we take advantage of this
opportunity and capitalize on the
consumer's desire to create a true home theater experience.   It is
obvious from this past holiday
selling season that people are willing to pay for quality products.  We
should fight to get our fair
share of those dollars.
<br><br>
Just down the road is digital television.  While the political process
set us back just a bit, TV and
computer manufacturers are already putting the pieces in place for a
1998 market introduction.  I
for one am looking forward to next January's CES where the first HDTV
sets should be on
display.  Digital TV is a win-win for everyone -- manufacturers,
retailers, broadcasters and
consumer.  I can't wait to get one in my home.  For those that have not
viewed this technology, I
must tell you it is really incredible.  
<br><br>
But, that isn't all.  Flat screen TV,  new cellular technology, digital
radio and the proliferation of
compact digital camcorders and cameras, are just some of the exciting
new products and
technologies that consumers can look forward to in the very near
future.  Look for them to flock
to your stores.
<br><br>
We should take pride in our accomplishments and our technological
advancements. We should
not sell ourselves short or cheap.  Our products are valuable and should
not be taken for granted. 
Our New Year's resolution should be to not undervalue our products and
to work together to
make 1997 a very profitable and successful year.  Notice the reoccurring
message in my speech.  
<br><br>
Leading the way to the future will be CEMA - our industry trade
association.  To many of you,
CEMA is just the organization behind these great CE Shows.  But, there
is much more to this
association.   CEMA provides its members with numerous services and
expertise ranging from
research to lobbying.  
<br><br>
Its extensive market research efforts provide us with monthly reports on
over 500 product
categories that help companies track sales to dealers.  Additionally,
CEMA conducts monthly 
consumer research projects that give us valuable feedback on consumers'
likes, dislikes and
future purchase intentions.
<br><br>
CEMA's technical experts coordinate efforts to create industry standards
for new technologies. 
They have been instrumental in making sure we have future products like
DVD, digital TV and
digital audio radio. CEMA is also our voice in Washington, which, for
many of our smaller
members is their only voice.  As an industry we can get more attention
on Capitol Hill than we
can as individuals and CEMA has done an excellent job in lobbying on our
behalf.
<br><br>
CEMA recently played a major role  in the HDTV negotiations, and has
been assisting members
in working through the complicated European Union directives that impact
many smaller firms
who export overseas.
<br><br>
I am pleased to announce some dramatic new CEMA programs for 1997.   An
industry
Consumer Electronics Executive Summit to be held June 25-27 in Bermuda. 
This three-day
invitation-only conference, which we hope will become a yearly event,
will give senior level
retailing and manufacturing executives a forum to discuss vital issues,
take a look at the future
and look towards growing a healthy consumer electronics industry. 
Issues to be addressed will
include new technologies, returns, zero percent financing, and
partnerships for the future.
<br><br>
Also planned for later in the year is a conference devoted solely to
product returns, a serious
problem that plagues both retailers and manufacturers.     You will hear
much more about both of
these programs in the near future.
<br><br>
Lets reach out to a profitable future.  None of us are alone out there. 
We should take advantage
of the support and assistance CEMA provides.  Together, we can all make
1997 a banner year. 
Good selling and have a great show.
