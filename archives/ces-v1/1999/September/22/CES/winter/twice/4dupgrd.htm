Suppliers Upgrade Shelf System Capabilities



</b></font></center><br>

The audio industry is expanding its selection of shelf systems with Dolby Pro Logic surround, upscale price tags, and component-size performance at WCES in response to the growing use of shelf systems as primary listening systems -- and the growing need by retailers and suppliers to strengthen sales at higher price points.<br><br>Pointing to that need, Pioneer estimated that 68% of all shelf systems sold in 1996 were retail-priced at $299 or less.<br><br>To change that ratio, Harman Kardon, Sharp and Pioneer are here at WCES with their first Pro Logic shelf systems; Yamaha is introducing its first compact system consisting of separate mini-size components; and Harman Kardon expanded its selection of high-end two-channel shelf systems. Sansui is also at WCES with new Pro Logic shelf systems. <br><br>In recent months, Denon and Onkyo introduced their first Pro Logic shelf systems; and JVC introduced tiny shelf systems targeted at discerning two-channel listeners.<br><br>The introductions underscore how a large consumer segment looks on shelf systems as primary audio and home theater systems, whereas only five years ago, shelf systems were used as secondary music systems in kitchens, bedrooms and dens, suppliers said. Because many of today's shelf-system purchasers want component-like power and features, many of this year's introductions, like last year's, incorporate higher ticket features such as 2x100-watt amplifiers and Dolby Pro Logic. <br><br>The same issues motivated Yamaha to introduce its first series of Classic minicomponents at WCES. The first three Classic components, less than a foot wide and about 15-inches deep, are a Pro Logic receiver rated at 3x45 plus 2x15 watts, a CD player, and a dual-well cassette deck sold as a system for a suggested $1,250.<br><br>The receiver incorporates a 5.1-channel input and digital soundfield processing, which creates concert hall and rock concert modes for music. DSP video modes are Pro Logic, 35mm Cinema DSP, concert video, and mono movie.<br><br>Also at the upper end, Harman Kardon introduced its revamped Festival line of high-end compact systems. At the top of the trio is the $1,999-suggested-retail Festival 80, billed as a space-saving high-performance home theater solution. The components consist of an AM/FM tuner, seven-disc CD changer, Dolby Pro Logic processing, five two-way satellite speakers, and a powered subwoofer that incorporates amplification for all channels to the tune of 3x55 plus 2x20 watts, with another 100 watts for the subwoofer.<br><br>The 80 is due in late spring. The two-channel Festival 60, due at the same time, will retail for a suggested $1,199. A two-channel Festival 40 will retail for a suggested $899.<br><br>Sharp's first Pro Logic shelf system, also on display at WCES, is priced at a suggested $399 an ships in April. The CD-C460 minisystem comes with 70 watts of amplification, three-disc changer, and five speakers. Two other new Sharp minisystems are priced at a suggested $199 and $249 with three-disc changers. And three new midi systems are priced from a suggested $319 to $699, the latter with 50+1 CD changer.<br><br>At WCES, Pioneer is positioning its new CCS-406 minisystem as an A/V system. The 406, Pioneer's first shelf system with Pro Logic, is expected to ship in March at an expected retail of no less than $599. It also features a 25-disc changer, 2x70 plus 2x20 amplification, and three-way speakers.<br><br>With the 406 and four new two-channel shelf systems at $249 to $500, Pioneer is expanding its shelf selection to five models from three. Three of the line's models will have 25-disc changers, up from last year's two.<br><br>Panasonic's shelf-system focus remains in the two-channel market at WCES, where the company is adding higher power to its shelf line. The new SC-AK91, for example, is a biamped 2x100-watt system compared to 2x70 watts and no biamping in the model it replaces. Each speaker contains a tweeter, midrange, woofer and built-in subwoofer. It also features a 50+1 CD changer. It's due in May at an expected retail of $499.<br><br>The SC-AK71, due in June at $399, is rated at 2x70 watts compared to the 2x35 watts in the model it replaces. It also comes with 50+1 changer.
