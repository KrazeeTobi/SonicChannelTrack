Keynote Speeches Open 1997 Winter CES <br>
with a Peek at the Digital Future

</b></font></center><br>


LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, January 9, 1997.  Heading into the 21st century, the consumer electronics industry can look forward to a thriving, digital future where products will continue to make consumers' lives easier and better.  This was a consistent theme among the three keynote presentations today, marking the official opening of the 1997 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> ) in Las Vegas.
<br><br>
Michael R. Bloomberg, president and founder of Bloomberg Financial Markets, challenged the standing-room audience in the Las Vegas Hilton to produce new practical products that can be used by everyone -- not just the technologically inclined.  Mr. Bloomberg said that the products of the future should match the functionality of a newspaper.  &quot;What is it about newspapers that keep people reading?  There are two fundamental benefits -- a newspaper is a random access device, and it keeps readers informed.  If our businesses are going to grow, we have to make our products more like a newspaper.&quot;
<br><br>
Relating what he considers to be the key benefit of a newspaper -- the ability to find only the sections you want to read -- Mr. Bloomberg emphasized the similar potential of services such as video-on-demand.  &quot;The fact of the matter is that the public wants to see things when they want to see them.  Video-on-demand, a digitally delivered product, is the way of the future -- a killer application.&quot;
	<br><br>
Finally, Mr. Bloomberg said that he believes the convergence of products such as Internet TV and TV/PC will render competition between the consumer electronics and computer industries moot, because &quot;in the next two years the difference between PCS and televisions will go away.&quot;
<br><br>
The future of the industry was the focus of the preceding speech by Robert Borchardt, CEO of Recoton Corporation and chair of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA).  Despite a challenging 1996, Mr. Borchardt's outlook for the industry's future was very optimistic.  &quot;I am confident the future holds great promise for sales and profits to rebound for the industry.  How can I be so sure?  It's simple.  Consumer electronics products offer incredible value.  What other type of product can you think of that has steadily decreased in price, while adding features and benefits?  Virtually none.&quot;
<br><br>
While talking about the future, Mr. Borchardt relayed his thoughts about two of the key products on the horizon -- DVD and HDTV.  &quot;DVD and digital television should drive consumers back into the stores.&quot;  He added, &quot;While I do not expect DVD to be the savior for our industry, I anticipate that it will create some needed excitement and prompt consumers to upgrade other components such as their televisions, audio equipment and speakers.&quot;  	     
<br><br>
Regarding HDTV, Borchardt remarked that &quot;Digital TV is a win-win for everyone -- manufacturers, retailers, broadcasters and consumers.  For those that have not viewed this technology, I must tell you it is really incredible.&quot; 
<br><br>
CEMA President Gary Shapiro also remarked on the industry's digital future.  &quot;While I believe there are enough eyeballs to go around for the television and computer industries to benefit, we must continue to create exciting and compelling products.  HDTV and DVD are two such products.&quot;
<br><br>
Finally, after looking back on thirty years of CES, Mr. Shapiro focussed on this year's show as he left the audience with a reminder of why they're here.  &quot;As you walk the aisles, keep in mind that these are the products that will help grow this business.  These are the products that will drive customers into your stores.  These are the products that will take us all into the 21st century.&quot;
