<p>


NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  The 1997 International Winter 
Consumer Electronics Show (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>) will be the first major trade show to 
be independently audited since a recent agreement between the Audit 
Bureau of Verification Services, Inc. (ABVS) and IAEM Services, Inc.  
<br><br>
Created specifically to verify trade show attendance, ABVS is a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), the 
world's largest auditor of newspapers and periodicals.  In August, ABVS 
and IAEM Services, a subsidiary of the International Association for 
Exposition Management (IAEM), announced a joint program to educate trade 
show organizers and exhibitors on the necessity of auditing expositions.
<br><br>
Winter CES, to be held in Las Vegas, NV, January 9-12, is the world's 
largest computer and consumer electronics trade show aimed at the retail 
distribution channel.  More than 80,000 retailers, distributors, buyers, 
press and industry personnel are expected to visit the 1500+ exhibitors, 
covering more than one million net square feet of exhibit space.
<br><br>
&quot;CES has long held an honest policy of self-auditing of our attendee 
figures.  In 1989, we were one of the first trade shows to verify our 
attendance figures through badge holder pick-up auditing.  Now we're 
taking our policy of  honesty one step further by using an independent 
auditor designed for trade shows,&quot; said Gary Shapiro, president of CEMA, 
the Winter CES manager and sponsor. &quot;We are pleased that ABC and ABVS 
took the lead in offering this type of program.  We are proud to be the 
first show to take advantage of it.  We challenge other trade show 
organizers to do the same so that exhibitors can truly compare their 
trade show options.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Industry acceptance of this program will allow the exposition industry 
to prosper as better comparisons can be made with alternative forms of 
marketing,&quot; said Steven Hacker, CAE, president of IAEM.  &quot;The audit will 
verify the absolute attendance of a show.  It will also ensure that the 
demographic profiles exhibition management provides to potential 
exhibitors are accurate. If the trade show industry shifts to attendee 
verification and independent audit, the entire industry's credibility 
will soar.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;As an association, our members expect honesty.  Now we have an 
independent measurement system in place to further back-up our 
statistics,&quot; added Shapiro.
<br><br>
&quot;We congratulate CES for being the first trade show to make this 
commitment since the IAEM agreement.  Their decision puts them at the 
forefront of a new effort to respond to the exhibitor's need for 
reliable, credible information to provide accountability for their trade 
show investment,&quot; said Michael J. Lavery, ABC and ABVS president and 
managing director.
<br><br>
ABVS auditing services verifies attendance and attendee information 
claims, records and recordkeeping systems.  On-site and post-show 
analyses are conducted with every ABVS audit.
<br><br>
During the trade show, ABVS auditors will validate attendance with an 
in-depth examination of CES' recordkeeping systems and procedures, 
including direct, on-site observation of its registration system.  
<br><br>
After CES closes, attendees will be contacted independently to validate 
information collected during the show.  With the source documentation 
provided by CES, auditors will then reconcile the attendance list, 
eliminate duplicate names and verify demographic data. 
<br><br>
Following the audit, ABVS will produce an audit report, identifying key 
audiences, demographics and geographic make-up of trade show 
participants.  CES will receive the report on the winter show within 
three to four weeks after providing final documentation to the ABVS 
auditing team.
<br><br>
ABVS was established in 1995 to serve the verification requirements of 
new and non-traditional, census-based advertiser-supported media.  In 
addition to its trade show auditing program, ABVS Interactive provides 
third-party audits for Web sites and other online advertising activity 
claims.  ABC is the world's first and largest circulation-auditing 
association with more than 4,100 advertiser, advertising agency and 
publisher members.
<br><br>
IAEM is a not-for-profit association representing approximately 3,800 
individuals within organizations that manage more than 75 percent of all 
North American trade shows.
