</b></font></center>
<p>


NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  The International Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>) will host the world's largest gathering of 
the mobile electronics industry ever at the Sands Expo &amp; Convention 
Center in Las Vegas, January 9-12, 1997.  As of late October, requests 
for mobile electronics exhibit space within the Winter CES were up 10 
percent compared to the same time frame for the 1996 show;  much of the 
allocated mobile exhibit space within the Sands has been sold.  
Historically, the Winter CES has been and continues to be the world's 
largest trade-only exposition for the mobile electronics industry.
<br><br>
This year more than 210 mobile exhibitors will be showcasing their newest 
products at the Sands.  Plus, there will be additional autosound exhibits 
in the Sands parking lot.  A few other mobile electronics companies are 
scattered throughout the Winter CES facilities.  The biggest players in 
the industry will be at the Sands, including AAMP, Alpine, Audiovox, 
BEL-Tronics, Blaupunkt, Clarion, Cobra, Directed Electronics, Eclipse by 
Fujitsu Ten, Kenwood, MTX, Phoenix Gold, Pioneer Electronics, Rockford 
Fosgate, Stillwater Designs and Whistler.
<br><br>
&quot;By using the entire Sands Expo and Convention Center, we're able to 
offer the industry the best in facilities with special services for those 
exhibitors and attendees, plus room to expand as this product category 
has grown both on the show floor and at retail,&quot; said CES Vice-President 
Jonathan Thompson.  &quot;In an effort to build booth traffic for Sands 
exhibitors, we're pulling out all the stops.&quot;
<br><br>
<b>These promotional plans and services include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Express shuttle among all CES facilities;
<li>Direct non-stop bus service between official CES hotels and the Sands;
<li>Complete line of service facilities, including an international 
business center, press room, registration area, CES store, CEMA/MECP 
booth and CEMA member business center and lounge;
<li>Innovations located at the Sands (More than 30,000 attendees saw 
Innovations, the Winter CES awards program and display, during the 1996 
show);
<li>Meeting/closing rooms; 
<li>On-site housing assistance; 
<li>Promotional partnership mailings;
<li>Mobile electronics exhibitor kiosks; and
<li>A 1997 Ford F150 Supercab sweepstakes; the truck will be outfitted with 
some of the latest mobile electronics gear and given to a lucky CES 
attendee at the Sands.
</ul>
CES is working with Sound Solutions to create a Mobile Electronics 
Exhibitor Information Kiosk System which will graphically display mobile 
electronics booths.  The kiosks also will contain details about bus 
schedules, conferences and a display of the Sands floor plan.
<br><br>
<b>Profit-Making Opportunities &amp; Tools</b>
<br><br>
One of the fastest emerging products within the mobile electronics 
industry is the vehicle navigation system.  Awareness of these systems is 
definitely on the rise, up to 66 percent, according to a recent survey.  
Eighteen percent of consumers say they are interested in purchasing a 
vehicle navigation system.  A special Intelligent Transportation Systems 
(ITS) Pavilion to help mobile electronics retailers take advantage of 
this growing market will be located within the Sands.  Participants in 
the pavilion include Etak, Navigation Technologies, POIS, RoadTrak and 
Rockwell.
<br><br>
To help capitalize on the new profit-making products introduced at Winter 
CES, retailers should plan on attending at least one if not many of the 
educational sessions included in the 1997 Winter CES Conference Program.  
All mobile electronics sessions will be at the Sands, including:
<ul>
<li>Car Navigation -- What are the Options?;
<li>Computerizing Your Mobile Electronics Business;
<li>How to Troubleshoot During an Installation;
<li>How the Aftermarket Can Complement with OEM Installation;
<li>What's New and Profitable in Auto Security;
<li>How to Sell Beyond the Basic System; and
<li>Promoting Installation as a Profit Center.
</ul>
Also in the Sands, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association 
(CEMA), the Winter CES sponsor and manager, will host an association 
booth featuring the Mobile Electronics Certification Program (MECP), 
mobile electronics market research, mobile electronics membership 
services and other products and publications for the mobile industry.  
MECP certifies installers of autosound, cellular and vehicle security 
systems.  During Winter CES, attendees can take all four exam levels.  
<br><br>
All profits from the Winter CES are reinvested into industry services, 
including MECP, media relations programs, engineering standards 
development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support 
as directed by CEMA.  Through services such as these, CEMA is working to 
expand the consumer electronics industry for both manufacturers and 
retailers.
