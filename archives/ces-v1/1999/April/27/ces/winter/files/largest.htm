<p>      



ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, August 26, 1996.  Mobile electronics and wireless 
communications companies will have one of their best showings ever at the 
International Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size="1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="1">®</font></sup>) in Las Vegas, 
January 9-12, 1997.  More than 80 percent of the product area for mobile 
electronics and wireless communications exhibitors within the Sands Expo 
&amp; Convention Center has been sold.  As of mid-August, 203 mobile 
electronics companies and another 111 cellular and paging companies had 
been assigned space within the Sands, totaling 227,263 net square feet -- 
ahead of 1996's sales pace in regards to cellular and about even in the 
cases of paging and mobile electronics.  The Winter CES is the world's 
largest trade-only exposition for the mobile electronics industry.
<br><br>   
&quot;Overall exhibitor sales are going well with 1,331 companies signed up to 
exhibit,&quot; said Robbi Lycett, Winter CES Show Director.  &quot;Some of the 
biggest players in cellular, paging and mobile electronics will be 
showcasing their newest and most advanced products at the Sands, 
including AAMP, Air Touch, Alpine, Audiovox, BEL-Tronics, Blaupunkt, 
Clarion, Cobra, Directed Electronics, Eclipse by Fujitsu Ten, Ericsson, 
Kenwood, MobileComm, Motorola, MTX, NEC, Nokia, Pacific Bell Mobile 
Services, PageMart, PageNet, Pioneer Electronics, Rockford Fosgate, 
Stillwater Designs and Whistler.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;By using the entire Sands Expo and Convention Center for 1997, we're 
able to offer the mobile and wireless industries the best in facilities 
with special services for those exhibitors and attendees, plus room to 
expand as those product categories have grown both on the show floor and 
at retail,&quot; Lycett added.
<br><br>    
Show management is finalizing promotional plans for the 1997 Winter CES.  
With the Sands as a primary facility for 1997, CES has added many 
services to balance and enhance traffic flow among all trade show 
facilities.  Since this is the first time mobile electronics exhibitors 
are at the Sands, show management is pulling out all the stops to 
highlight this area for CES-attending retailers.  These plans include:

<br><br><ul>Express shuttle among all CES facilities, including back-door delivery;
<br>Complete line of service facilities, including an international 
business center, press room, registration area, CES store, and CEMA 
member business center and lounge;
<br><br>Innovations located at the Sands -- More than 30,000 attendees saw 
Innovations, the Winter CES awards program and display, during the 1996 
show;
<br><br>Meeting/closing rooms; 
<br>On-site housing assistance; and
<br>Direct non-stop bus service between official CES hotels and the Sands.</ul>

Other promotional activities include give-away incentives for buyers and 
press; a promotional partnership mailing; a video wall at the McCarren 
Airport promoting the Sands; banners at CES facilities, show hotels and 
bus shuttle sites promoting the Sands; and a special Sands advertisement 
to run in key trade publications.
<br><br>
More than 40 educational sessions are included in the 1997 Winter CES 
Conference Program.  All wireless and mobile electronics sessions will be 
at the Sands, including:
<br><br>
<ul>Paging's Role in the New Wireless World<br>
PCS: What is the Status<br>
Car Navigation -- What are the Options<br>
Computers in Mobile Electronics<br>
How to Troubleshoot During an Installation<br>
What's New in Auto Security<br>
How to Sell Beyond the Basic System<br>
Promoting Installation as a Profit Center</ul>

Moderators and panelists for these sessions will be announced within the 
next few weeks.  A special Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) 
Pavilion to help mobile electronics retailers take advantage of this 
growing market will also be located within the Sands.  This third annual 
showcase will house several manufacturers within 2,000 net square feet. 
The Pavilion allows manufacturers - especially OEMs, smaller companies, 
and young ITS product divisions at large corporations -- to get their 
feet wet in marketing their ITS products at Winter CES without the 
financial and logistical obligations of launching a full product line and 
booth.  Last year's participants included Delco Electronics, Etak Inc., 
ITS America, Magneti Marelli, Navigation Technologies, POIS, Rockwell 
Automotive and Siemens Automotive.  
<br><br>
All profits from the Winter CES and other CES-sponsored events are 
reinvested into industry services, including the Mobile Electronics 
Certification Program (MECP), media relations programs, engineering 
standards development, market research, and governmental and legal 
affairs support as directed by the Winter CES sponsor and manager, the 
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA).
