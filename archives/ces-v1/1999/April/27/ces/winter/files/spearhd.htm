Convention Center (LVCC).

Gary Smith, manager of trade show operations and marketing support for 
IBM,  said, &quot;the 1997 CES provides us with the best internet showcasing 
opportunity that exists in the industry.  We are delighted to be 
spearheading this project with CES especially as part of one of the 
largest converging electronics trade shows in the world.&quot;
<br><br>
Smith added, &quot;Both the high-interest and high-activity level for internet 
and converging categories at CES already demonstrate that this is indeed 
the ideal, exciting and vibrant venue for showcasing the converging 
marketplace.&quot;
<br><br>        
Jonathan Thompson, vice president of CES, said &quot;the industry and CES is 
fortunate to have an industry leader such as IBM demonstrating the latest 
in internet technology.  For years, IBM has been a solid long-term 
contributor to the show as well as a proven industry pioneer.  The 
company's sponsorship of the Internet Showcase only adds fuel to the 
internet fire at the 1997 show.&quot;
<br><br>
Overall, more than one million square feet of exhibit space at the Winter 
CES has been assigned to more than 1500 companies and manufacturers from 
all over the world.  Featuring nearly 400 new exhibitors, the CES will be 
located at four major locations: the LVCC, the adjoining Las Vegas 
Hilton, the Sands Expo and Convention Center, and the Alexis Park Hotel.

  Traditional audio and video products will converge with internet and 
satellite products in the LVCC.  All major Direct Broadcasting System 
(DBS) manufacturers will exhibit their latest products in this facility.  
Companies such as Philips, Sony, Thomson, and Zenith will be 
demonstrating their new TV/PC and internet products.

designed to improve passenger and freight efficiency and safety along 
surface transportation modes.  Products will include in-vehicle 
navigation systems, traveler information systems, safety devices, Mayday 
and collision notification systems, and vehicle radar systems.  As part 
of its larger presence at the CES, the Sands is also serving as an 
additional arena for all product categories as more and more companies

companies like AudioQuest, Krell Industries, Martin-Logan, Mobile
