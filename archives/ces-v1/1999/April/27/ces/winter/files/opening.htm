Las Vegas, NV, January 9, 1997  -- Converging technologies and the Internet play the
key 'reality' roles for the 1997 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show  (CES ),
surrounded by a strong supporting cast including red hot Internet technologies, dramatic digital
products and pulsating special-interest pavilions.  More than 80,000 attendees will have a first-hand look at the products and technologies that will be on retail shelves tomorrow as they walk
over one million square feet of exhibit space in the next four days.
<br><br>
Convergence today best describes the merging technologies of today with television
companies and telecommunications provides offering interactive Internet capabilities and
computer companies offering broadcast and entertainment venues -- all providing the consumer
with a wide choice of products.  
<br><br>
Converging technologies include DVD, DSS, TV/PC, web-browsing TV, interactive
cable, digital cameras, smart phones, wireless products and more -- all with related ancillary
products, accessories and support.
<br><br>
The cast of characters for the 1997 Winter CES includes the debut of the Internet
Products Showcase sponsored by IBM, the Emerging Technologies Pavilion, the Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS) Pavilion, Innovations '97 and hundreds of companies led by top
names such as Casio, Denon, Thomson, Philips, Pioneer, Sharp, Sony and Zenith.  &quot;These
pavilions represent the hottest emerging technologies coming into the marketplace today. For
buyers and retailers to see all of this together in one place at one time and have the occasion of
being part of this first-hand, is an opportunity that simply should not be missed,&quot; said Robbi
Lycett, Winter CES show director.  
<br><br>
More than one million square feet of exhibit space has been assigned to more than 1800
companies and manufacturers from all over the world.  Featuring over 400 new exhibitors, the
CES will be located at four major locations: the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), the
adjoining Las Vegas Hilton, the Sands Expo and Convention Center, and the Alexis Park Hotel. 
The 1997 Winter CES is attracting nearly 3,000 media journalists from around the globe.
Traditional audio and video products will converge with internet and satellite products in
the LVCC.  All major direct broadcasting system (DBS) manufacturers will exhibit their latest
products in this facility.  Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Philips, Sony, Thomson, Zenith
and others will be demonstrating their latest Web-browsing TVs, and Internet products. 
Companies like JVC and Casio will be showcasing their advanced digital camcorders.  The latest
technologies and products for the small office/home office (SoHo) will be showcased by such
companies as Brother International, Franklin Electronic Publishing, Hewlett-Packard USA, 
and Royal Consumer Business Products.
<br><br>
The nearby Las Vegas Hilton will be the headquarters for all home theater and home
systems manufacturers and marketers.  MB Quart, as part of its Domain loudspeaker line, is
unveiling a high-powered subwoofer with an interchangeable flip-up top for ease of operation by
the consumer in home theater scenarios.  Also, Lutron Electronics is using the CES to introduce
its Spacer lighting remote control and dimmer, making home entertainment retreats or office
environments as custom and automatic as desired.  Other companies showcasing equally exciting
new products at the CES include THX, MTX, Creston, Phast and X-10 (USA).  &quot;As products
for home entertainment and other home functions become popular, these companies' integrated
home system products are becoming a necessity for the home builder and installer,&quot; said Lycett.
The Sands Expo and Convention Center will be playing an ever-greater role at the '97
CES with about 650 exhibitors in more than 500,000 square feet of exhibit space, including the
mobile electronics, cellular, paging, wireless, telephone, personal electronics and more.  CIDCO,
with its caller ID products and new smartphone; Audiovox and Motorola with small, digital
telephones, and Tandy and others with &quot;Family Radio&quot; are all part of the powerful assembly of
exciting products being exhibited at the Sands.  Innovations '97, the prestigious honors showcase
of the best-of-the-best products exhibited at Winter CES, selects winners via a panel of
journalists tasked with choosing the ultimate in design, engineering and software excellence. 
The Sands also is host to the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Pavilion. 
Represented by such companies as ComRoad, Etak, Navigation Technologies, Pois,
RoadTrac, Rockwell  and ITS America, the pavilion will feature products designed to improve
passenger and freight efficiency and safety along surface transportation modes.  Products will
include in-vehicle navigation systems, traveler information systems, safety devices, Mayday and
collision notification systems, and vehicle radar systems.  
<br><br>
The Internet area in the Sands, featuring such companies as Audiotek, is a showcase of
the latest 
state-of-the-art Internet products.  As part of its larger presence at the CES, the Sands
also is serving as the overall overflow arena for all product categories as more and more
companies catch CES fever and sign on.
The Alexis Park Hotel will be the main home for specialty audio for companies like
AudioQuest, Krell Industries, Martin-Logan, Mobile Fidelity, Thiel and Vandersteen,
displaying state-of-the-art audio advancements.  
<br><br>
A highly-focused comprehensive conference program of more than 50 sessions to be held
at all four main locations consists of eight tracks: new technology, Internet, multimedia, SoHo,
specialty audio, mobile electronics, home theater and general sessions.  Two six-session
accredited tracks on home systems and retail management also are available for $125 total or $30
a session.
<br><br>

president and founder of Bloomberg Financial Markets.  Bloomberg will present the prestigious
keynote address during the opening session on Thursday, January 9 from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m.
along with Bob Borchardt, president of Recoton and chairman of the Consumer Electronics
