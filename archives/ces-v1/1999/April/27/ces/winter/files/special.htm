NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.   With the theme &quot;Beat Yesterday's 
Performance,&quot; the organizers of the 1997 International Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>), the premier event for the consumer electronics 
industry, will be showing buyers and decision-makers attending the show 
just how to beat yesterday -- by offering tomorrow's technologies now.
<br><br>
&quot;CES, through its special exhibits and pavilions for evolving 
technologies, is putting the focus on the future and excitement of 
consumer electronics by highlighting and displaying the most dramatic new 
technologies.  The Emerging Technologies Pavilion, the Intelligent 
Transportation Systems Pavilion (ITS), and Innovations `97 all will offer 
far-reaching insights for the retailers and buyers into the technologies 
of tomorrow today,&quot; said Jonathan Thompson, CES Vice President.
<br><br>
The Emerging Technologies will be located on the lower level of the Sands 
Expo and Convention Center just left of the Registration lobby.  The ITS 
Pavilion and Innovations `97 is on the upper level of the Sands Expo on 
the left side toward the back.
<br><br>
The first-time Winter CES Emerging Technologies Pavilion focuses on small 
companies manufacturing products who produce less than $2 million in 
sales and have fewer than 15 employees.  This is an entrepreneurial 
showcase which highlights small companies efforts which may become the 
Microsoft or Motorola of tomorrow.
<br><br>
The ITS Pavilion features products designed to improve passenger and 
freight efficiency safety along surface transportation modes.  It 
includes exciting in-vehicle navigation systems, traveler information 
systems, radar, Mayday and collision notification systems.
<br><br>
Innovations '97 includes those &quot;best-in-class&quot; products that are winners 
in the Innovations `97 Design &amp; Engineering Honors Program.  These select 
product winners are honored as the most prestigious product and design 
advancements at the 1997 Winter CES.
