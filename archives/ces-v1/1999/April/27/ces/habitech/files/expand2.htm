Dallas to Host 1997 Event</font></center>

 
<br><br>
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, September 4, 1996.  The premier trade and training 
event, CES<sup><font size="2">®</font></sup> Habitech, is expanding its scope to include small building 
systems and service providers.  The annual event, which is managed, 
sponsored and produced by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers 
Association (CEMA), will now showcase those products that are installed 
and integrated in the residential and light commercial market.  CES 
Habitech '97, to be held June 24-26 in Dallas, will feature the 
infrastructure, controls, communications, entertainment, security and 
energy management products that enable systems integration in today's 
home as well as in small commercial applications.
<br><br> 
Some of the systems and products to be exhibited at the Wyndham Anatole's 
Trinity Hall include network infrastructure, home theater/entertainment, 
HVAC, lighting, security, telecom/intercom, whole house/building, 
conference/board room, and related technologies and systems.
<br><br>
&quot;We recognize that many of the products in this area are appropriate for 
both residential and light commercial applications and most of the 
integrators we attract do business in both  markets,&quot; said CES Habitech 
Show Manager, John Galante.  &quot;In addition, Texas' construction and high 
technology markets are in the midst of a steady, healthy boom.  Combine 
that with the easy, affordable air travel access in the Dallas area, and 
CES Habitech should experience an even stronger nationwide draw for the 
event.&quot;
<br><br>
In addition to the exciting and innovative products on display, CES 
Habitech will offer the most comprehensive conference program of its kind 
in North America, with dozens of hands-on trade and training sessions for 
the professional interested in advice from the experts in home and 
building networks.  For 1997 a special conference track has been added to 
focus on small building networks.  
<br><br>
&quot;The CES Habitech conference program provides attendees with the 
technical, marketing and management information needed to tap the 
potential of the home systems market,&quot; said conference organizer, Tricia 
Parks, president of  Parks Associates.  &quot;We've worked hard to provide the 
best training possible for system integrators.&quot;
