Carriers Blur
Lines Between
Cellular, PCS

</b></font></center><br>


Traditional cellular carriers, even those that are involved in PCS launches of their own, are intent on erasing the lines between PCS and cellular. It's a matter of frequency, they say, and consumers don't care about the nuts and bolts of their wireless services.
<br><br>&quot;We're trying to blur the distinction between PCS and cellular,&quot; says Trent McGuire, a spokesperson with AT&amp;T Wireless. &quot;Our view is call it all cellular or call it all PCS. We don't want consumers thinking that they're getting a bum deal at 850 Mhz.&quot;AT&amp;T Wireless rolled out 850 Mhz digital cellular on its entire system   40 major markets   in early October.
<br><br>&quot;We have the same features on 850 as we will with 1900 Mhz,&quot; McGuire says. AT&amp;T also plans to roll out 1900 Mhz service in 23 markets by the end of  1997. AT&amp;T is also pushing the TDMA technology of its digital networks. &quot;TDMA has been in operation since early 1993. With CDMA technology, you only have coverage where there is CDMA coverage,&quot; McGuire says.
<br><br>Dual-mode phones   capable of communicating on both analog and digital networks   combine the sexy features of digital PCS with the roaming capability of traditional cellular.
<br><br>AT&amp;T's launch of  digital cellular steals some of the thunder from PCS, according to Zweig. &quot;The initial uniqueness of that product has been diminished,&quot; she says. The most aggressive PCS launch belongs to PrimeCo, the joint venture involving Bell Atlantic/Nynex, Airtouch and Western Wireless. In November, PrimeCo rolled out networks in Texas, Florida and Virginia, along with Chicago, Milwaukee and New Orleans.
<br><br>PrimeCo now sells PCS through its own stores, as well as through general retailers, including Circuit City, Office Depot, Best Buy, Computer City, Wolf Camera &amp; Video&quot;We want to be available to the customer however they want to buy,&quot; says Allen Bourne, PrimeCo's distribution channels director.
<br><br>PrimeCo isn't calling their product PCS, either. &quot;We're introducing it as a new wireless phone service, with a number of new features,&quot; Bourne says. &quot;We like to position it as wireless the way it should be.&quot;
<br><br>Bourne says PrimeCo is pushing the PCS as an easier way for consumers to get into wireless communication. &quot;We're highlighting the simplified billing, with only two rate plans,&quot; he says. &quot;That's one of the things that have turned off may prospective wireless customers ever since the advent of cellular.&quot;
<br><br>PrimeCo currently has the country's only CDMA networks, so roaming is limited to the PrimeCo coverage areas. &quot;We expect roaming capabilities as others come on line,&quot; Bourne says.
<br><br>Though Airtouch is one of the PrimeCo partners, the company is still touting the strengths of cellular.&quot;There's a lot of confusion in the marketplace right now,&quot; says Amy Damianakes, an Airtouch spokesperson. &quot;PCS players are taking the approach that it's going to obsolete cellular.&quot;
<br><br>Not true, she says, &quot;PCS, because it is digital, has some capabilities that go beyond what analog cellular has. But digital cellular and PCS are kissing cousins.&quot;
<br><br>AirTouch, which just went on-line with digital cellular in Los Angeles, isn't selling digital through general retail yet, choosing direct sales to move high-usage customers over from the analog network.&quot;With the beginning of year, we'll broaden that distribution,&quot; Damianakes says.
