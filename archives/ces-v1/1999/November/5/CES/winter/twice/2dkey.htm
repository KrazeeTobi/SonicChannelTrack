Bloomberg Says CE Industry Must Meet Consumer Needs

</b></font></center><br>


Media mogul Michael Bloomberg kicked off the 30th anniversary CES with a simple message to the industry: Provide the products consumers want, not the ones you want to sell.
&quot;I am a consumer. And consumers don't care what you want to sell,&quot; Bloomberg said in his keynote address. &quot;They're the ones who are running this marketplace. Let's give them what they want.&quot;
<br><br>What they want, he said, is to be able to access exactly the entertainment and information they want, when they want it. &quot;The killer application is video on demand,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't stop it, because the demand is there.&quot;
<br><br>Bloomberg dismissed the much-hyped battle between the PC and the TV for the consumer's attention. &quot;PC versus TV? Two years from now, no one's going to care,&quot; he said. 
<br><br>Bob Borchardt, CEMA chairman and CEO of Recoton, offered a sober assessment of the industry's health, but he predicted better times ahead.
<br><br>&quot;Consumer electronics just ended one of the most difficult years I can ever remember,&quot; Borchardt said. &quot;Profitless prosperity is not the answer. Our New Year's resolution should be not to under-price our products.&quot;
<br><br>Promising new technologies and products, however, can help pull the industry out of its current doldrums, Borchardt said. &quot;Strong growth may be on the horizon with DVD and HDTV. Our industry must capitalize on the opportunity.&quot;
<br><br>To address some of the challenges facing the industry, CEMA will host a summit of retail and manufacturing executives in Bermuda this June, Borchardt said. A separate CEMA conference, also set for this year, will address product returns.
<br><br>As part of the opening ceremonies, CEMA president Gary Shapiro presented awards to 30 companies that have been exhibitors at each and every CES since 1967.
