Caller ID Service Is Growing<br>
When Coupled With Call Waiting

</b></font></center><br>



Although &quot;block name,&quot; &quot;privacy,&quot; &quot;unavailable,&quot; and &quot;out-of-area&quot; still account for a significant portion of the messages seen on Caller ID equipment, there's little doubt that early adapter frustration will go away and the service will grow as it becomes more useful by being coupled with Call Waiting.
<br><br>

The good news in 1996, for manufacturers, retailers, and consumers was that the CLASS Caller ID service became a national reality as California joined the rest of the country, albeit with a &quot;number only&quot; designation.
<br><br>

The bad news is that the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCS)   and some 1,300 independent phone companies   are at various stages in their ability to implement off-hook Call Waiting with on-hook caller ID.
<br><br>

But the equipment producers see the future and are gearing for it by concentrating their efforts this year on adjunct boxes and integrated phones that offer Type II, and even Type III Caller ID capability, known informally as SCWID and DSCWID, or Spontaneous Call Waiting, Caller ID, and Spontaneous Call Waiting, Caller ID...with Disposition...or Deluxe.

<br><br>
Type I, on hook, basic service is available in most residences and small/home offices now.
<br><br>

With Type II, users can discern the person who is on Call Waiting when they're already engaged in a conversation, and then make an informed decision about whether to interrupt the on-line caller.
<br><br>
Type III, allows them to dispose of the call, &quot;interactively,&quot; by responding in a variety of ways, including bringing the individual into the conversation; and also to capture information about the call &quot;waiter&quot;  while staying with the primary caller. Because of the new practicality, expectations are that Type I will become a commodity product.
<br><br>

Even though it will take time for the service to fully roll out, the Type II and III equipment moves Caller ID to a higher level of functionality, and is expected to significantly raise it from the current 10% installed base level, considering that Call Waiting is already at more than 50 percent, manufacturers believe.
<br><br>

And, makers expect that the regional phone companies, recognizing the recurring revenue potential, will invest to proliferate the technology: to some degree in defense of the free-for-all starting to take place among competitive access organizations; i.e., cellular is aiming for both long distance and local markets, the RBOCs themselves want a slice of long distance, and AT&amp;T is looking to capture a 30% share of the local business by 2000.
<br><br>

At this stage, switch implementation is in the RBOCs' court, but the sophisticated consumer equipment is already out there for 1997, emphasizes Charles E. Gay, marketing services director for Cidco.
<br><br>

Gay's observation that the makers are taking the lead in preparing consumers for a leap forward can be seen in a smart phone that Cidco has just introduced. &quot;It's a product that will support all of the new services such as SCWID, and will also provide access to the Internet through a seven-inch touch screen that will enable you to get the full Web experience, with graphics,&quot; he says. (See separate story for some major producers' new 1997 Caller ID entries on page 82.)

<br><br>
Another smart phone that supports advanced Caller ID services has recently been introduced by InteliData Technologies, created by the merger of Colonial Data Technologies and US Order, that separately were among the early developers, respectively of Caller ID, and the smart phone.

<br><br>
As InteliData's marketing VP Joe Payne, reports, &quot;One of the patented features that we have is a 'block' on the 'blocker' capability. If someone doesn't want you to see who is calling, our technology will send a message to the blocker that says, 'This line doesn't accept blocked calls, please unblock your number.' One of the drivers on Caller ID is the whole security/privacy issue. And we're addressing that. Our whole mission is Caller ID. That's what the company does. And you'll see over the next 12 months some very innovative applications of that.&quot;
<br><br>

While the right to privacy and the perception of anonymity are always important, Payne asserts, &quot;The folks who say, 'We don't want this information passed,' have lost the battle. The information is being passed today. So the question now is, whether you like it or not, do you want to be one of the people who reads it? And I think most will say, 'Yes.' &quot;
<br><br>

In that regard, Dennis Cox, marketing VP of Casio PhoneMate stresses, &quot;There's an element of the end user environment that wants to maintain a privacy level, and they're going to be holdouts. But with Call Waiting at a 50% level, people will all-of-a-sudden realize that the simultaneous capability makes a lot of sense.&quot;
<br><br>

Cox adds that Casio PhoneMate &quot;wouldn't enter the market without advanced Caller ID equipment because we believe it's the right answer for consumers. It is really an investment in the future. 'Caller ID on Call Waiting' is an absolutely viable growth market. We have two additions to our line supporting the service, one is an adjunct answering machine, the other is an integrated answering machine with corded phone. It's a matter of changing the mindset of consumers when they see the utility in the capability.&quot;
<br><br>

Actually, &quot;Caller ID on Call Waiting,&quot; as Cox calls it, is the official Bellcore appellation. If any institution is responsible for creating the accepted industry moniker of SCWID, it is Northern Telecom (Nortel), that originally coined the term as an internal code name.

<br><br>
Says Bert Fletcher, Nortel's senior manager, market development, &quot;We were trying to get across the point that Call Waiting and ID could be used spontaneously. Unfortunately, it stuck and I've had people refer to our line as the calamari products.&quot;
<br><br>

But there's nothing even slightly fishy about SCWID, as far as Fletcher is concerned. As he puts it, &quot;A lot of service providers are opting to go straight to Type III. We put a Type III product out there and it works fine in all modes. Nortel has taken the manufacturing pressure off the obsolescence factor that occurs in the computer industry with a modular unit, depending on the module you plug in, it can be any of the types. It's the number one Type III set in the world and has about 90 percent market share in the U.S.&quot;
<br><br>

In Fletcher's view, after consumers experience the benefits of SCWID, when they look back they will say, &quot;Call Waiting was just a subset of the real feature.&quot; He adds, &quot;When I provide you, as a consumer, with value, you're going to drive the market. In our own internal budgeting process we see that happening fairly rapidly. I think you will see Type II in wide use by the end of 1999.&quot;
<br><br>

Picking up on that, Chris Furhmann, marketing VP for B.E.L.-Tronics, advises, &quot;When you talk to people who use, or purchase the products, what they're saying is that the reason they want Caller ID is not for the initial call, but for the call they get while they're on the phone. That seems much more important to many customers.&quot;
<br><br>

To satisfy that need, the company is showing adjuncts, &quot;That are unique because they have block reject/call reject features whereby consumers can put into memory numbers of individuals they don't want to hear from,&quot; Furhmann says. The feature is also in an integrated phone.
<br><br>

Even as consumer awareness is heightened to SCWID multifunction capability by RBOC and retail promotions, the fact is that basic and featured adjunct units will dominate the market for several years, says Furhmann, who sees the boxes, &quot;eventually available more as an entry level product, for the first time user.&quot;

<br><br>
And the other suppliers agree. Some also suggest that the less expensive Type I products will continue to have value for some period of time. 

<br><br>
Eldon Chuck, product marketing manager for the communication groups at Thomson Consumer Electronics, states: &quot;There is a secondary market out there for Type I equipment, still. We see the main phone, wherever that may be in the house being a fully-featured Type II, possibly a Type III. But what about the rest of the rooms? I don't think people will replace their phones with a Type II unit. I think they'll buy Type I boxes   currently at $29 to $39   just to see who is calling in. I assume someone will come out with a de-featured unit at $19.99.&quot;

<br><br>
He adds, &quot;Considering the limited money the consumer has to spend,  you'll see us, as well as our competitors continuing to offer adjunct Type II boxes that are more affordable than integrated units.&quot; Thomson will have Type II boxes ready this quarter. 
<br><br>

In the same vein, John McNenney, national marketing manager for telecommunications of Panasonic, whose company is offering two cordless Caller ID integrated phones, thinks adjuncts &quot;will be with us for awhile, especially since the market penetration on Caller ID is still so low, and the RBOCs will continue to give away the boxes as an incentive for signing for the service.&quot;
<br><br>

McNenney notes, &quot;It could be compared to the answering machine business. Although stand-alone answerers aren't a growing business they have been around for a lot of years. I see corded Caller ID boxes taking the same path as stand-alone answerers. They will have nice growth over the next couple of years, then they'll peak out and most of the sales will go the integrated route.&quot;
<br><br>

Further, McNenney is of the opinion that cordless integrated handsets with Caller ID will play an important role in the market because of their portability.
<br><br>

That view of cordless sits well with a Lucent Technologies spokesman, who reminds, &quot;Nowadays, about half of the phones are cordless. Our position in the industry is the market leader in cordless, corded and answering machines. In cordless we're number one with about a 30% share, which is more than double the second ranking company.&quot;
<br><br>

Lucent doesn't talk about upcoming products, but the spokesman refers to the company's digital answering speakerphone with Caller ID, that was launched last April, as indicative of the direction it is taking.
<br><br>

&quot;That product,&quot; he says, &quot;has all of the benefits of digital technology, which improves reliability by recording voice messages in solid-state memory chips.&quot; He declares, &quot;We're excited about Caller ID because it went national, and we predict that customers are going to be growing at about 18% a year, compounded for the next four years.&quot;
<br><br>

Advanced Caller ID capability is being highlighted in adjunct units and integrated telephone equipment this year. Here is a sampling of what is available from some key suppliers.
<ul>
<li><b>              Bel-Tronics</b>   is offering three units. Adjunct, AD100, at a $59 suggested retail price (SRP), retains a record of the last 100 incoming callers; has a Call Reject that allows the user to record up to 100 undesirable calls and respond with a polite message stating the call will not be accepted. A Block Reject feature intercepts incoming calls from persons who block their identity and responds with a pre-recorded message advising that the party doesn't accept such calls. Stand up design allows easy viewing of LCD from a distance. 


<br><br>AD101, at $49, SRP, is essentially the same without Call Reject/Block. 


<br><br>Caller ID on the CF130 integrated speakerphone with electroluminescent display, at $119 SRP, identifies name and number of caller when the phone is engaged (SCWID). And Caller ID numbers can be dialed directly from memory with a single key press. The unit also has Call Reject/Block.
<br><br><li><b>              Casio PhoneMate</b>   has two new products that feature Type II caller ID. One is an adjunct answering machine and the other an integrated answering machine with corded phone. The adjunct unit, TA-160, is about $80. The answering machine/phone, TI-360, has a street price of about $100. In addition, the company has a cordless, Caller ID configured phone, CP-725, at about $100.
<br><br><li><b>               Cidco</b>   has several products, among them are: The CL-500CWi, the first Type II cordless unit that also supports one-touch access to telephone company network services. The model has nine dedicated soft keys offering one-touch access to voice mail, repeat dialing, call forwarding and other network services, at a $219 SRP. 


<br><br>The company's CST-2000 ADSI screen phone, at $249 SRP, provides increased access to telephone management services and personal information such as stock quotes, news and sports scores. It features a nine-line LCD screen and 14 soft keys, and is fully ADSI-compliant, providing a platform for services such as home banking, retrieving personal financial data or retrieving Internet e-mail. 


<br><br>At under $500, the company is introducing the iPhone telephone with a graphical screen display that offers quick access to the World Wide Web. With an attached keyboard, graphical Internet browser interface and a seven inch touch screen it can &quot;surf'' the Internet, just like a PC. Telephone companies will also be able to build their own customized services into the graphical interface. The iPhone is a joint venture between CIDCO and InfoGear Technology, a subsidiary of National Semiconductor.
<br><br><li><b>               ClassCo</b>   is putting a new twist on Caller ID with its new CIDney line of products that both announce and display the caller's information. The 9500 lists at $99.95 and the model 9500cw Type II unit is $119.95. Both also offer other advanced features such as the ability to leave outgoing messages for specific incoming callers. 


<br><br>The model 550 carries a $59 price tag and a two-line version will sell for $129.95.<br><br><li><b>Cobra</b>   is adding Caller ID for the first time this year and will feature Type II units. The CID 1000 will sell for under $100. Also coming are two Intenna products with Caller ID, the model 2525 at $129 and the 2530 at $139 with private call and power protector.
<br><br><li><b>               InteliData Technologies</b>   is emphasizing its new Call Manager, Model 2100, at under $130 suggested retail. It is an adjunct device that is designed to be used with voice mail and Type III caller ID. 


<br><br>Another new unit is the Intelifone, smart phone (Model SP 2000). Designed for use on analog phone lines, the unit, at $299 SRP integrates a full-feature speaker phone with graphic display, alphanumeric keyboard, V.22 modem and card reader. It combines a personal organizer   500 entry directory (names, numbers, address and notes) and a calendar   with advanced SCWID. In addition to being fully compliant with the Bellcore ADSI standard, the instrument is pre-programmed to access the US Order SmartTime Network for information, transaction and communication services.
<br><br><li><b>               Northern Telecom</b>   has launched a multi-line telephone system that includes AudioEdge sound quality and digital bandwidth signaling to allow multiple voice communications to occur at the same time. The instrument allows up to eight telephones to share three analog lines. It doesn't require a central system controller, and is the first KSU-less system to provide integrated caller ID and call waiting right on the telephone. The Multi-Telephone has a $299.95 SRP.


<br><br>Also, there two cordless phones, the Maestro 6200 and 6300, that both feature DSWID. In addition, Nortel will have an advanced adjunct in April.
<br><br><li><b>               SNI Innovation</b>   is featuring three new adjunct Caller ID units at prices ranging from $29.95 to $89.95 for the SN-095CW that operates with call waiting.


<br><br>The company is also showing new corded phones with Caller ID. the IP-60A lists for $59.95 and the message phone MP-200 with visual indication for voice mail lists for $69.95.
<br><br><li><b>               Thomson Consumer Electronics</b>  , presently with Type I cordless adjuncts and cordless phones will have a type II adjunct this quarter, and by the second half will have a type II cordless phone. The basic Caller ID boxes, 2-9030 and 2-9060, one with 30 name/number capability, the other with 60, are promoted at $29.95 and $39.95 SRPs. An integrated, corded unit, the 2-0295, is $49.95. A high end product, the 2-9398, a corded, one touch, featured speakerphone is $99.99.
<br><br><li><b>               TT Systems</b>   is featuring its new Type II TT-95NCW Caller ID unit with 95-name/number memory. At a suggested retail price of $79.95, it has a large three-line display to show the name and number of each caller, along with the time and date of the call, a call counter and a call summary.
