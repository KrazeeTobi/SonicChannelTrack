<p>


ORLANDO, FLORIDA, April 19, 1996.   Next year's CES<sup><font size="1">®</font></sup> Mobile Electronics 
will move to the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia.  The 
MES is the world's only trade show dedicated exclusively to the 12-volt 
industry and provides a true educational forum for manufacturers of 
mobile electronics products and accessories to conduct business with 
retailers and installers of these products.  The 1997 Show will be held 
April 4-6.
<p>
The 1997 will features the next generation of products in car audio, 
vehicle navigation, vehicle security, radar detection, safety warning 
systems, CBs, scanners, mobile office, cellular, personal communications 
systems (PCS), paging and mobile electronics accessories.  
<p>
The aftermarket mobile electronics industry is expected to continue its 
steady growth.  The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association 
forecasts dollar factory sales of aftermarket vehicle security to rise 
seven percent from 1996 to 1997.  Unit factory sales of in-dash CD 
players are expected to grow 16 percent from 1996 to 1997 with sales of 
autosound CD changers to increase 13 percent during the same time period.
<p>
Exhibit space selection for the 1997 Show will begin at this year's show 
location in Orlando on April 20.  Show management expects at least 200 
exhibitors will be on board for the 1997 MES, covering approximately 
98,000 net square feet.  MES '96 exhibitors will have priority in 
selecting booth space for the 1997 Show.
<p>
CEMA owns, manages and sponsors several industry trade shows including 
the CES Mobile Electronics, International Winter Consumer Electronics 
Show (CES), CES Specialty Audio &amp; Home Theater, CES Mexico, CES Habitech 
and CES Orlando...The Digital Destination (premiering in 1996).
<p>
 In 1994 CEMA co-sponsored the MES with Bobit Publishing, the Show 
founder.  CEMA assumed the role of Show manager of the MES beginning with 
the 1995 Show.  All profits from the Show are reinvested into industry 
services and the programs and activities of the CEMA, including the 
Mobile Electronics Certification Program (MECP) and other services for 
the mobile electronics industry which are offered by CEMA's Mobile 
Electronics Division.
