NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  Families increasingly want more 
home entertainment.  Retailers ready to capitalize on this trend will 
find a host of new home entertainment profit makers at the Las Vegas 
Hilton and Alexis Park hotels during the International Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>), January 9-12, 1997.  Home systems exhibits 
will be placed alongside home theater and multi-room entertainment 
exhibits at the Las Vegas Hilton; specialty audio and some high-end home 
theater exhibits will be shown at the Alexis Park.  Some home control 
products also will be displayed at the Las Vegas Convention Center.      
<br><br>
&quot;This year at the Hilton, CES is promoting the growing synergy of custom 
home theater products into integrated home systems by providing a 
one-stop venue to see these fast-growing products and services,&quot; said 
Robbi Lycett, Winter CES Show Director.
<br><br>
Attendees at the 1997 Winter CES will see some new companies on the 
Hilton exhibit floor.  Among the first-time CES home systems exhibitors 
are: AMP, AVSI, Dancraft Enterprises, Diablo Research, IES Technologies, 
Lutron Electronics and PHAST.  Home theater companies such as Atlantic 
Technology International, Definitive Technology, Lucasfilm/THX, Madrigal 
Audio Labs, Marantz America, Niles Audio, Sonance and Stewart Filmscreen 
will also be exhibiting at the Hilton.  In total, more than 170 
exhibitors, covering approximately 69,000 net square feet of space, will 
be housed in the Las Vegas Hilton.
<br><br>
Lycett added, &quot;We see home and building control and home theater as some 
of the fastest-growing segments of our industry.  CES' commitment to 
these product categories can be seen in exhibit space expansion, a 
comprehensive seminar track, and a major effort to attract system 
designers, installers, integrators and retailers.  Winter CES has become 
an invaluable showcase for the home systems and home theater industries.&quot;       
<br><br>
<b>Alexis Park is THE Trade Show Venue for Specialty Audio</b>
<br><br>
Specialty audio manufacturers and retailers will view the Alexis Park 
Hotel as their personal trade show venue at Winter CES.  During the 1997 
show, all companies with a specialty audio focus will be located at the 
Alexis Park.  More than 150 specialty audio exhibitors, covering 
approximately 32,000 square feet of space, are expected, making the 
Alexis Park host to one of the largest gatherings of the specialty audio 
community ever.
<br><br>
&quot;Some of our largest exhibits at the Alexis Park include Adcom, 
AudioQuest, Burmester Audio Systems, Krell Industries, Martin-Logan, 
Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, Nakamichi, TEAC America, Thiel and 
Vandersteen Audio,&quot; said Lycett.  &quot;With the Sahara undergoing major 
renovations this year, we had to move the specialty audio exhibitors to 
another venue.  Fortunately, we found the Alexis Park, a hotel which can 
offer both exhibitors and attendees superior benefits and services.&quot;
<br><br>
Located at 375 East Harmon Avenue, the Alexis Park is less than two miles 
from the Las Vegas Convention Center.  The hotel has ample self-parking, 
valet parking, a four-star restaurant, and a multilingual concierge 
staff.  There is no casino at the Alexis Park, so finding exhibitor rooms 
will be quick and uncomplicated.  Sleeping rooms are available at the 
hotel for both exhibitors and attendees.
<br><br>
Express shuttle bus service is available between all CES facilities.  
Plus, on-site registration, a CEMA member lounge and on-site housing 
assistance will be available at the Alexis Park.  Journalists can pick up 
Alexis Park exhibitor press kits outside the CES Show Office at the 
Alexis Park Hotel.  
<br><br>
