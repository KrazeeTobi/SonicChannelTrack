</b></font></center>
<p>
 

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  The sights and sounds of 
multimedia, the Internet, and converging technologies will be emanating 
from the halls of the 1997 International Winter Consumer Electronics 
Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>), January 9-12,  in Las Vegas.  The show will mark the 30th 
anniversary of CES.
<br><br>
&quot;For thirty years CES has showcased the industry's cutting-edge products 
to the world, and our commitment to IT and converging products in the 
upcoming Winter show will once again highlight why CES is the place to 
see the products of the future,&quot; said Robbi Lycett, Winter CES Show 
Director.  &quot;On the show floor, right before our eyes, we will see the 
lines of distinction between computers, communications, and traditional 
consumer electronics products continue to blur, while exciting new 
products and services emerge.&quot;
<br><br>
<b>Exhibitors Enthusiastic for CES</b>
<br><br>
A broad range of exhibitors focusing on new computing and converging 
technologies are signed up for Winter CES.  The impressive list of

&quot;Hughes is looking to Winter CES as a launching pad for our entry into 
the consumer electronics marketplace, as we take our satellite know-how 
from the corporation to the home,&quot; said Dick Armstrong, Vice President 
and General Manager, Broadcast Products for Hughes Network Systems.  &quot;In 
addition to our quality DSS dish and receiver, we are very excited to 
showcase our satellite-based DirecPC&#132; System which enables the consumer

<br><br>
&quot;The new Zenith will come out swinging at CES with some exciting entries 
in the digital and convergence arenas,&quot; said Gregg Gronowski, division 
Vice President, Product Management, Zenith Sales Company.  &quot;Among the 
products we'll show are Internet-surfing TVs and add-on boxes that can 
turn any large-screen TV into a computer monitor -- perfect for business
