Dolby AC-3 Should Continue<br>
Its Step-Up Role At Retail

</b></font></center><br>

Dolby Digital AC-3 fulfilled its expected role as a step-up lure for the hobbyist market in 1996, according to mid-fi suppliers who delivered Dolby Digital-equipped and ready receivers and processors to the specialty retail network last year.
<br><br>With only a scant number of Dolby Digital AC-3 laserdisc titles to support the fledgling next-generation surround-sound platform, there was little real call for 5.1-channel decoding capability, but the digital upgrade made its mark upon early adopters looking for the
 latest and greatest in home theater audio technology.

<br><br>Looking to 1997, where relatively affordable DVD players are expected to
 create a much greater demand for 5.1-channel digital surround playback systems, manufacturers hope Dolby Digital continues to carry panache among
 home theater buyers. At the same time they concede the market is ripe for confusion as the technology transitions to the mainstream market.

<br><br>At issue is the audio/video receiver, which has all but obsoleted the stereo receiver market. Only a small percentage of A/V receivers, however, are equipped to provide the full Dolby Digital experience with either the
 AC-3 decoder chip or independent rear surround channels. Will salespeople understand the mechanics of the Dolby Digital system enough to explain it to customers? Will consumers balk at having to upgrade their electronics in order to have the full benefit of DVD? Will the A/V receiver market
 stall in 1997 as consumers wait for the price of Dolby Digital AC-3 electronics to fall?

<br><br>&quot;1997 is going to be the year of Dolby Digital,&quot; says Grant Lansdell, national product specialist for home audio at JVC, &quot;but I think the biggest
 fear for all of us is that we'll do nothing more than add to the confusion consumers already have. There's the potential that we'll bring out product, there will be limited source material, there will be more inputs and then consumers will be rethinking what they finally realized was Dolby 
Surround. Our biggest challenge is to clearly convey what Dolby Digital is and make it so that a lot more people will be willing to take the plunge.
&quot;
<br><br>Marantz had success in 1996 serving its savvy upgrade customer base with
 high-priced early-adopter units, according to marketing manager David Birch-Jones. Now that the first-on-the-block customer's needs have been met
, however, the forecast is hazy for the rest of the year. How will the customer with the five-year-old Dolby Pro Logic receiver take to rehauling his receiver to gain AC-3 prowess? &quot;That's the $64,000 question,&quot; Birch-Jones says.

<br><br>Marantz took a modular and flexible approach to the issue by offering a good/better/best lineup of Dolby Digital-ready receivers last year, and then last July shipped the $700 DP-70 digital decoder which worked with all three models.
<br><br>&quot;We felt that having an expensive line of receivers with the decoders built in would not appeal to the high end segment of our customers,&quot; he says. The company also had in mind AC-3-equipped DVD players when it devised that strategy, although the players didn't materialize in
 1996.

<br><br>&quot;Customers who purchased the Marantz SR-770 Dolby Digital-ready receiver last year for $800, &quot;got a good Pro Logic receiver with the possibility for a future upgrade,&quot; Birch-Jones says. &quot;This way they weren't paying for
 something (AC-3 decoding) that they wouldn't be using for quite some time,&quot; he says. With the number of AC-3-equipped DVD players promised by Toshiba, Panasonic and presumably Marantz, Dolby Digital-ready receivers will be sufficient for many consumers, he says. &quot;By making Dolby Digital AC-
3 a fixture of all receivers, you're making consumers pay twice for the same thing,&quot; he says.


<br><br>According to Tom Graham, national marketing director for Yamaha, two-thirds of the company's receiver line in 1997 will have Dolby Digital built in or will be Digital-ready with the independent rear channels and a six-channel jack. Even in 1996, there were Digital-ready models selling on the street for $799 in order to spark a slow fall sales season, and those numbers will drop significantly by the end of '97 according to Yamaha market projections. &quot;Dolby Digital is pretty important for the revival of the
 audio market,&quot; Graham says, &quot;and you're going to see much more reachable
 price points to allow more people to get involved.
&quot;
<br><br>As a core supplier of mid-fi audio, Yamaha has a stake is preserving customers' commitment to the audio portion of the home theater business. Since many DVD players, including a share of Yamaha models, will come with Dolby Digital AC-3 decoders built in, Yamaha wants to provide a niche solution for customers who are happy with their current stereo or home theater electronics. The solution is the DSP-E492, an add-on component that makes stereo receivers or amplifiers equipped with pre-main couplers Dolby Digital-ready. Carrying a suggested retail price of $399, the unit packs a
 trio of 60-watt amplifiers for center and rear-channel surround and a circuit that switches the amps between stereo and AC-3.

<br><br>&quot;I can't tell you the number of calls we've gotten from people asking what they can do to get AC-3,&quot; Graham reports. &quot;Until now, we've had to say
 they had to buy a new receiver, and they'd say, 'But I have this $900 amplifier that was state of the art 9 years ago, and I don't want to get rid of it.' The DSPE-492 takes a stereo amp and makes it a full-fledged Dolby Digital-ready system.
&quot;
<br><br>Onkyo reports a heavy backorder situation with its $1,500 TX-DS838 receiver with a built-in Dolby Digital AC-3 decoder, which began shipping late
 last year. The company will unveil a THX-certified 5.1-channel integrated amplifier at Winter CES, according to Ted Green, sales and marketing VP.
<br><br>&quot;It's an interesting market,&quot; Green says. &quot;Either there are more early adopters than we thought or there's a lot of pent-up demand for AC-3,
&quot; he says. &quot;The interest level is very high, and the enthusiasm is trickling down to home theater users. Initial bookings have exceeded our expectations.
&quot;
<br><br>Sony has downplayed the Dolby Digital theme along with its overall reticence about DVD prior to 1997. The company had an AC-3-ready receiver in its specialty ES line for the early adopter market but said all along that
 DVD and supporting Dolby Digital wouldn't be marketable until this year.

<br><br>The company will show at Winter CES a companion outboard processor for $
800 and a receiver with built-in AC-3 for delivery later in the year.

<br><br>&quot;AC-3 will be the step-up feature for receivers in 1997,&quot; said Ron Boire
, marketing director for hi fi, referring both to ES series and the upper end of the mainstream line. At the same time, he expects price-oriented Pro Logic receivers to fare well over the course of the transitional year. The premium for AC-3 is not one that everyone is going to want to pay for especially at the entry level,&quot; he says.

<br><br>Consumer education will be crucial to the development of the Dolby Digital market, Boire says, and Sony plans to lead a campaign that will deliver the Dolby Digital message to traditional audio magazines, retail point-of-purchase displays and training seminars nationwide. &quot;We'll be communicating about DVD and hi fi and the difference between Pro Logic and AC-3,
&quot; Boire says, &quot;and we'll be encouraging consumers to step up to AC-3.
&quot;
<br><br>With Kenwood already having broken the $1,000 barrier for an AC-3-equipped receiver last year, there's little doubt that entry-level Dolby Digital receivers will drop below $700-$800 later this year when DVD hardware and software ramps up. Mid-fi suppliers will be attempting to hold the upper tier of product in the $1,500-$1,600 range. 


<br><br>At CES, Harman Kardon will show the AVR-75 receiver, which will retail for $1,600 when it ships in April, according to Tom McLoughlin, HK president. McLoughlin agrees that education is key to the success of DVD but Harman will rely on its sales staff as disciples of the breaking format. &quot;Our thrust will be to educate the retail sales staff,&quot; he says. &quot;They're our first line of defense for customers, and we have a training manager and
 independent reps who do nothing but train the sales force.
&quot;
<br><br>The introduction of Dolby Digital last year erased the high-end Pro Logic market, according to Stephen Baker, sales and marketing VP at Denon America, one of the first suppliers of AC-3. In fact, Denon helped the downshift when it took the price of its flagship AVR-2500 down $200 to $800
 and replaced the $1,000 price point with the Dolby Digital-ready AVR-260
0. The migration south for Pro Logic will pick up steam once DVD arrives in full force.

<br><br>&quot;You'll see Dolby Digital-ready receivers starting at around $500 and going to $1,000,&quot; predicts Denon's Baker, &quot;and there's a clear trend toward
 Dolby Pro Logic falling below $500. Our goal is to get people into a full system with Dolby Digital and DVD for a significantly lower price than what it currently costs,&quot; Baker says. &quot;The cost of AC-3 chip sets is still rather high, but that will change. We have many serious manufacturers who have chip sets in the pipeline. We're going from a few AC-3 chip sets to busloads.&quot;
