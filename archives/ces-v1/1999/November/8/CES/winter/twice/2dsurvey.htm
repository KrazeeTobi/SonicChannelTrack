Exhibitor Survey Shows Upbeat Mood On 1st Day

</b></font></center><br>


The near-record crowds that flooded the exhibits at this Winter CES can be considered a reflection of the generally upbeat retailer outlook for 1997 as indicated by the results of TWICE's exclusive survey of exhibitors conducted on the show floor yesterday.
<br><br>Asked what kind of feedback they are getting from dealers with respect to the prospects for 1997 business, fully 79% of exhibitors said retailers were looking for the year to be better than 1996.
<br><br>But, realistically, said one respondent, 1996 &quot;was such a bad year, there's nowhere to go but up.&quot; Things apparently have already picked up to a modest degree, with another exhibitor noting that he has seen improvement in orders from both retail and OEM accounts. However, pointed one retailer pointed out, &quot;some of our retail customers are doing well, others are out of business.&quot;
<br><br>As indicated in past surveys, the majority of exhibitors (63%) said they were not here at the show expecting to write any major orders. Fully 74% said they were looking to sign on new accounts. That's a somewhat higher percentage than in past years, and may be the result of last year's rash of store closings and bankruptcy filings.
<br><br>The survey results indicate that, at least for this year, the Winter CES will continue to outshine its summer counterpart. Only 42% of exhibitors at this show said they were considering displaying at the June 2-5 Summer CES to be held in Atlanta in conjunction with COMDEX. But 53% said they were interested in showing at the Fall COMDEX, scheduled to be held in Las Vegas in November.
<br><br>Also, the survey shows, the growing internationalization of CES continues to be of major importance to exhibitors. Some 58% of queried exhibitors said foreign buyers at the show are creating new business opportunities for them. Several said they saw international accounts as a way to lessen the impact of the soft U.S. market, and one expressed appreciation for the list of foreign attendees supplied by WCES show management.
