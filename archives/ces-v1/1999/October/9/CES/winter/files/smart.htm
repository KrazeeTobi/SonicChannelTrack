Buyers to Descend on 1997 WCES</b></font></center>
<p>

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  The Consumer Electronics 
Industry's most influential buyers will descend on the 1997 International 
Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size="-1">®</font></sup>) in Las Vegas, and they will have 
plenty of hot new digital products to see as well as the latest prototype 
products and technologies.  The CES show, which runs from January 9-12, 
will be hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), the Las Vegas 
Hilton, the Sands Expo &amp; Convention Center, and the Alexis Park Hotel.
<br><br>   
&quot;Based on a 1996 CES attendee audit, 88 percent of the buyers come to CES 
looking for products fresh on the market, nearly half come to see 
prototypes, while 6 out of 10 percent are looking for mature categories.  
If you combine the plethora of exciting, digital convergence products 
that just hit the market, and converging technologies that are becoming 
intertwined at a compounded rate, and the thousands of buying 
decision-makers, there will be a lot of happy campers at the 1997 CES,&quot; 
said Jonathan Thompson, vice president of the Consumer Electronics Shows.
<br><br>
Another interesting comparison based on last year's CES which adds to the 
convergence spin is 85 percent of the top computer retailers attended the 
show, while nearly 80 percent of the TWICE Magazine top 100 consumer 
electronics retailers attended the CES.
<br><br>     
&quot;With more than 1500 companies exhibiting along with nearly 400 brand new 
exhibitors, coupled with the first-time Emerging Technologies Pavilion, 
the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Pavilion, and Innovations 
`97, the prestigious consumer electronics honor roll exhibit, there will 
be more than enough convergence and technological developments to keep 
the buying community more than motivated for the full four days,&quot; 
Thompson reported.
<br><br>
1997 CES is already off to a tremendous start with approximately 10 of 
the largest buying companies represented at the very highest levels.  
Among some of the major retailers registered this year are the senior 
vice president of merchandising, AAFES; the senior vice president, BJ's 
Wholesale; president, Brandsmart; president, Best Buy; chief executive 
officer, CompUSA; president, Elek-Tek; president, Fedco; senior vice 
president, Fingerhut; president, H.H. Gregg; president, Nobody Beats the 
Whiz; president, Hardlines-Sears; chief executive officer, Service 
Merchandise, and chairman, Tweeter.
<br><br>
According to this survey, buyers as a group brought $46.4 billion in 
retail buying power to the 1996 CES with an average of $1.6 million in 
retail buying power per buyer.  Additionally, 65 percent of the buyers 
attending the show indicated they have final decision-making authority 
while some 25 percent of the buyers responded that they have significant 
influence in retail buying.
<br><br>
In addition to wanting to find the latest and greatest products in the 
world of consumer electronics at the 1996 CES show, buyers said that they 
also were interested in networking with their peers, and comparison 
shopping of vendor lines in one location.  On average, they prefer the 
broad horizontal appeal of WCES, while 80 percent prefer to attend one 
large, multi-category show rather than other smaller, single category 
shows.
<br><br>
Last year's WCES, repeat attendees among the buyers reached 70 percent, 
while new buyers reached 30 percent.  The audit indicated that the entire 
buyer audience turns over every 5-6 years.
<br><br>
&quot;With more than 80,000 distributors, manufacturers, market analysts,  
importers/ exporters, and journalists also descending on the 1997 WCES, 
the industry buyers will be among a vast audience from over 50 states, 
and 110 countries.  The 1997 WCES, with nearly one million of square feet 
of exhibit space, is sizing up to be the best consumer electronics 
showcase ever, particularly in the areas of new converging products -- 
from TV/PCs to multi-function centers to satellite products to digital 
cameras to computer and telephony products.  This year's industry 
showcase promises to be just what the buyer is looking for plus a whole 
lot more,&quot; said Thompson.
