Independents Ponder Strategies During TWICE Retail Roundtable


</b></font></center><br>

Coming off a year that was good for major appliance sales but not good for consumer electronics, independent retailers are taking steps to jump start their 1997 business.<br><br>At a TWICE roundtable discussion held here, 1996 was described as &quot;a wake-up call for the consumer electronics industry&quot; by Dave Workman, president/COO of Colorado-based Ultimate Electronics, because of its disappointing sales. This year could bring more of the same, Workman says, &quot;unless successful retailers move themselves outside the box and think about creating business that would not naturally be there&quot; by building store traffic and taking time to promote package sales and add-ons.<br><br>&quot;Retail salespeople need a different mind-set -- instead of going for the fast nickel, working for the slow dime,&quot; he suggests.<br><br>At the current stage of market saturation and retail competition, market share gains are not easy to come by, says Doug Colbert, VP of the American Appliance chain in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. While predicting an upturn in his own company's sales this year, Colbert says, &quot;If you want to grow today, you have to take share from someone else, by dressing up your stores, getting your ads right -- the basics.&quot;<br><br>Adds Colbert, &quot;A power retailer has to be a low-cost provider and have a perception of broad selection. If your advertising doesn't scream out those two things, you won't be successful.&quot;<br><br>Dan Crain, of four-store Appliance &amp; Furniture Mart in Garden City, Kan., sees add-on sales as one key to boosting profitability this year. &quot;We plan to be more aggressive about extended service and peripherals as profit centers,&quot; he says. <br><br>Another approach Crain takes is promoting home theater packages that customers can't get elsewhere. &quot;They'd have to go to two or three other places to get all the equipment in our package,&quot; he explains. &quot;We provide one-stop shopping.&quot;<br><br>That kind of narrowed focus is a good strategy for independents, according to Bob Lawrence, executive director of the AVB buying group. &quot;We're seeing a shift from independent retailers trying to be all things to all people, because we can't,&quot; Lawrence says. &quot;What's working for our members is becoming more of a specialist in areas such as home theater and built-in appliances,&quot; which offer less competition and higher profit margins.<br><br>Although most retailers at the roundtable decried the widespread use of 0% financing, they agreed it is here to stay. <br><br>On the bright side, however, &quot;these 0% offers can work to help consumers add on to what they're buying,&quot; such as creating a more fully featured home theater package, says Ron Romero of Schaefer's TV &amp; Appliance Center in Lincoln, Neb. <br><br>Romero, who is also chairman of the board of NARDA, suggests retailers should also &quot;maximize their sales ability and improve their people skills by providing value-added services&quot; as a way to compete. &quot;We have to make sure we're the best at what we're doing,&quot; he says.<br><br>&quot;Customer service is key,&quot; agrees NARDA's director of retail development, Hugh Eubank. &quot;A progressive retailer, willing to reinvest in his or her business, will not only survive but do well.<br><br>&quot;Independent retailers have a fantastic opportunity, but they have to do all the basics, including stressing add-on sales,&quot; Eubank says. &quot;You can't just survive in this business. You've got to grow.&quot;
