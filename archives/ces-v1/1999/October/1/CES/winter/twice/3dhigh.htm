High Hopes For High Tech Shown In Retailer Survey


</b></font></center><br>
 

The crowd of independent retailers filling the show venue aisles at this Winter CES came primarily to see new products and, in general, have high hopes for the new technologies being introduced here, according to the results of an exclusive TWICE on-floor survey conducted yesterday.<br><br>That new products are proving to be the big draw at the show is evidenced by their being cited by 80% of survey respondents as being the primary reason for attending. Ranked a distant second in importance was the chance to meet with suppliers, with a relative handful saying the most important job here is to help set spring-summer buying plans.<br><br>Although the sales results for 1996 being reported by the large, publicly held retail electronics-appliance chains reflect the generally depressed state of the market, things were a lot better for the smaller independents -- or at least so they say.<br><br>Asked how their 1996 business compared with that of 1995, fully 74% said they experienced an improvement, while 21% said their operation was relatively flat. Only 5% said their fortunes declined.<br><br>But while the average independents apparently had a good year in 1996, they are not going overboard in terms of inventory building for 1997. Just over half of those asked said they were holding their open-to-buy at this Winter CES at about the same level it was at this time last year, 29% indicated they were coming with a somewhat larger order book, and 12% said they were cutting back.<br><br>As for what new product the independents are counting on most as a sales booster, DVD was the runaway winner of the optimism award. Asked to predict the mass market success prospects of DVD, 47% said excellent and an additional 42% said good. All the others rated the outlook as just fair, but not one said poor -- the remaining multiple choice option.<br><br>While the TV-PC combo and the set-top TV Web browser shared an overall 58% favorable rating, the browser came out on top with an &quot;excellent&quot; view of its prospects offered by 21%, against just 16% for the TV-PC. But on the other side of that same coin, 11% said they considered the outlook for the TV Web browser to be poor, against just 5% with a downbeat view of the TV-PC.<br><br>Car navigation systems came in fourth in our four-product poll, but not by much. Its prospects raking as excellent came in at 20%, exceeding that of the TV-PC, while 35% said they saw the chances of success as good. But the largest response rating, 40%, was for &quot;fair&quot; -- and several of that group of respondents said that while they personally would like to have one, they questioned whether it would really catch on as a mass market item.
