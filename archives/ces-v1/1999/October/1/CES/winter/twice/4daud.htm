Audio Manufacturers Talk About DVD Audio Standards


</b></font></center><br>

It will be another six months to a year before the music and electronics industries agree on a DVD music disc standard, and it will take another one to one-and-a-half years before the first prototype DVD music players are unveiled, retailers were told during a seminar at the Alexis Park hotel.<br><br>The comments were made by Sony's David Kawakami, who is a member of the DVD consortium's working group on music DVD.<br><br>Kawakami also expressed optimism that the electronics industry would be able to meet a key music-industry requirement: that DVD music discs be playable on existing CD players. &quot;The music industry has asked for two-layer discs, one with Redbook CD audio and one with DVD audio,&quot; he explained. <br><br>Calling the request a &quot;very smart requirement,&quot; Kawakami nonetheless noted that &quot;it is a difficult requirement to comply with [in the disc replication process],&quot; but he noted that Sony and Philips &quot;have done R&amp;D on this&quot; in the past and that &quot;we think we can do it in a cost-effective way.&quot;<br><br>In other comments, Kawakami said he believes &quot;there is little danger&quot; that compressed audio will become a DVD standard because the music industry is very &quot;talent-driven&quot; and that artists and producers &quot;are insatiable in terms of the quality of the tools they want to work with.&quot;<br><br>Other music-industry requirements include copyright protection and multichannel capability.
