Intel Plans Major Ad Push For MMX Processors 


</b></font></center><br>


Offering encouraging news to computer retailers after a disappointing fourth quarter, Intel said it will begin advertising its new MMX Pentium processors on January 21 and 22. The campaign will be its largest advertising campaign to date, topping its huge Pentium campaign of several hundred million dollars, the company says. <br><br>In addition, many computer vendors, including Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, which launched the first MMX PCs during CES, have revamped all but leader models to the new MMX extension, signaling a swift industry conversion to the new processor.<br><br>The new MMX extension to the Pentium improves processor performance by up to 60% or 70% in audio, video and graphics modes to boost multimedia applications. <br><br>Hewlett-Packard said initial MMX products were selling very well, based on early retail reports, according to general manager of the home products division Webb McKinney.<br><br>&quot;Our lineup now is all MMX except for one P150,&quot; McKinney said. &quot;We've had a hard, fast transition because there's no real price premium on MMX, and Intel is very strong on making all future products MMX, so anything non-MMX will be devalued.&quot;<br><br>Intel said there is still non-MMX product in the channel although close to a dozen leading vendors and retailers interviewed during CES -- including IBM, Compaq, Packard Bell, Hewlett-Packard and Acer -- said they had flushed old inventory through the channel. This followed the panic sales of the fourth quarter where many vendors slashed prices and retailers sold PCs below cost.<br><br>Intel manager of consumer brand strategy Vince Thomas, commenting on MMX at the Intel meeting room, said, &quot;This will be the biggest advertising campaign Intel has ever undertaken including a retail campaign with in-store events, demo days and co-op. Over the lifetime of the Pentium Intel said it will spend several hundred million dollars, and over the lifetime of MMX it will exceed that.&quot;<br><br>Major advertising is expected to kick off the third week in January with specifics still being finalized, said Thomas. Demo days are also expected to begin that week, promoting both MMX and Intel videophone, said David Baumgarten, North American retail marketing manager. <br><br>&quot;Starting January 21 all our store reps will be in the channel doing training for both MMX and videophone. There is incredible excitement for the MMX. I've been in the industry for 13 years, and the momentum that started from launch is the strongest I've ever seen,&quot; said Baumgarten.<br><br>Among those vendors showing MMX product at CES are Hewlett-Packard, which introduced on January 8 six new models, five with MMX, including the first units to place control buttons for audio, gaming, CD, messages, Internet and other functions directly on the keyboard. <br><br>The new Pavillion line includes the 7350P Imaging SKU, a P166 unit with MMX and built-in PhotoDrive 5 x 7 scanner, 2.5GB hard drive, 16X CD ROM, 33.6 Kbps modem, 2MB video RAM and 32MB EDO memory at $2,299 estimated street price. <br><br>The top-of-the-line gaming unit is the 7370V, a P200 model with MMX, 32MB EDO RAM, HP/Altec Lansing subwoofer and speakers, gamepad, 4.0GM hard drive, 16X CD-ROM, 3Dfx Interactive dual 64-bit Voodoo Graphics card, and 6MB video RAM at $2,699 estimated street price. <br><br>Other new Pavillion units include the 5320 non-MMX P150 with 8X CD ROM, 16MB EDO memory, 33.6 Kbps modem, 2MB video RAM, and 1.6GB hard drive at $1,399 and the Pavillion 7320, P166 with MMX minitower, which upgrades to a 2.1GB hard drive, and 16X CD-ROM at an $1,799 estimated street price. <br><br>Gateway 2000 also upgraded its destination PCTVs to MMX versions including the D5-166, a 166 version with MMX, offering a 31-inch VGA monitor, wireless keyboard and remote mouse, 32MB RAM, 2.5GB hard drive, 33.6 Kbps modem, and 8X CD ROM drive at $2,999.
