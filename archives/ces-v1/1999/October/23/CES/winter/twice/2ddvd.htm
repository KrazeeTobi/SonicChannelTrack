DVD Gets More Support From Hollywood Studios<br>
Sony/Blockbuster promo also improves prospects

</b></font></center><br>


DVD's prospects improved at WCES with the announcement that the Blockbuster video store chain will support the format's launch in a co-promotion with Sony.
<br><br>A trio of studios   Polygram, TriStar and Warner Home Video  also released additional details about their software launch plans, with Warner and TriStar announcing specific titles and spring shipments, while Polygram announced summer shipments of an unspecified number of titles. Toshiba, meanwhile, claimed that MGM/UA and New Line Cinema have also committed to software launches, but details were unavailable.
<br><br>In other DVD developments, Panasonic, Philips and Denon firmed up their DVD ship dates, with Panasonic and Denon targeting March, and Philips targeting spring. And Pioneer said it is on schedule to release its DVD trio in February as previously announced. For its part, Akai is demonstrating DVD at a hotel suite.
<br><br>To coincide with Sony's April launch of a $1,000 DVD player, Blockbuster will set up Sony DVD demo kiosks in 50 stores in an unspecified number of &quot;top&quot; markets, said Jonathan Baskin, Blockbuster's senior VP for corporate relations. Consumers who buy Sony DVD players will also be entitled to free Blockbuster rentals. 
<br><br>&quot;A lot of details about the promotion remain to be determined,&quot; he said, but it will be &quot;an extension of our Maximum TV relationship [with Sony].&quot;
<br><br>Baskin didn't say when Blockbuster would begin to stock DVD discs, but he did say he expects to carry DVD discs from other studios in addition to Sony's TriStar. For its part, TriStar reiterated its plans to release its first DVD discs to coincide with Sony's launch and announced that it will have 20 titles on disc by the end of the year. (See TWICE CES Daily, January 9, page 1.)
<br><br>At the start, Sony will bundle four discs with its player, said John Briesch, president of Sony's Consumer A/V Products Group. He expects U.S. video player sales to hit 500,000 in 1997.
<br><br>TriStar will set pricing for its discs at a range &quot;between current VHS sell-through and current laserdisc pricing,&quot; said TriStar president Ben Feingold. At retail, that would translate into about $19 up to $49, but final pricing won't be determined for another six to eight weeks, he said.
<br><br>TriStar's initial releases will include discs featuring both widescreen and pan-and-scan versions of a film as well as more than one language and foreign-language subtitles, Feingold said.
<br><br>Depending on final software prices, Blockbuster's Baskin added, it has yet to be determined whether Blockbuster will rent as well as sell discs.
<br><br>For its part, Warner released the name of 25 titles that will be available from the start, including Batman, Casablanca, The Fugitive, GoodFellas, JFK: Special Edition Director's Cut, Space Jam and Twister. The first will be available in the spring. Five future titles to be released simultaneously on VHS and DVD include Mars Attacks!, My Fellow Americans and Sleepers. 
<br><br>A spokeswoman said the first 25 will be available in late March or early April and that, unlike TriStar, the titles would be available at &quot;VHS sell-through prices,&quot; not at prices ranging from VHS to laserdisc sell-through prices.
<br><br>Warner also said that it would include additional information on discs such as trailers and material about the cast, director, and making of the film.
<br><br>Doug Dunn, chairman of Philips Sound &amp; Vision, said Philips' Polygram unit will support the DVD launch with titles this summer in North America. Software marketing plans were still being worked out at show time, he said, but DVD titles will include feature films, children's programming and music videos. Software pricing was not announced.
<br><br>On the hardware side, Philips Consumer Electronics announced that it will introduce its DVD movie player in the U.S. this spring. The price of the DVD400AT was expected to be &quot;around $600,&quot; said Dunn.
<br><br>Panasonic announced a March 1 ship date, pending software availability, at expected retails of $599 and $749. The step-up piece will include built-in Dolby Digital decoder.
<br><br>Denon also released more details about its DVD plans, pricing the unit at a suggested $999 and promising March shipments. Earlier it had mentioned spring shipments.
