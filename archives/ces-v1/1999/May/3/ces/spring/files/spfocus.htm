ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, November 18, 1996.  Today we are reading e-mail on 
the TV, watching movies from a PC, downloading vast amounts of data from 
a small satellite dish, listening to stereo sound from a CD-ROM drive, 
and accessing the Internet from a telephone.  What new converging 
products are on the horizon, and how will these products impact the 
consumer and the consumer electronics marketplace?  The answers to these 
questions will be answered with an extensive conference program and 
exhibits of the latest converging technologies at the Spring Consumer 
Electronics Show (CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174</font></sup>), June 2-5, 1997 at the Georgia World Congress 
Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
<br><br>
For the first time ever, Spring CES will be co-located with 
COMDEX<sup><font size=-1>&#174</font></sup>/Spring, along with WINDOWS WORLD<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup> and EXPO COMM.  Combined, 
this event will attract a broad, international audience of 
decision-makers in computing, consumer electronics, telecommunications, 
and information technology -- the backbones of the burgeoning convergence 
trend.
<br><br>
"This Spring mega-event brings together the world's most successful 
technology trade shows just as the lines of distinction between our 
industries continue to blur," said Jonathan Thompson, Vice President, 
CES.  "For attendees, Spring CES offers an opportunity to see all of the 
cutting-edge consumer electronics products alongside IT and communication 
products.  CES Exhibitors will benefit from exposure to a broad spectrum 
of computer and consumer electronics retail buyers, as well as new 
distribution channels.  1997 is the year for DVD, TV/PCs, and a host of 
exciting digital and converging products that are transforming our 
industry, and this combined Spring event will be the perfect showcase."
<br><br>
Already signed up to exhibit at Spring CES are some of the leading names 
in the convergence marketplace: Zenith, Thomson, DirecTV, JVC, Curtis 
Mathes, Recoton, Casio, Cobra, and Polaroid, to name a few.
<br><br>
<b>Survey Says</b>
<br><br>
Consumer research conducted by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers 
Association (CEMA) earlier this year shows that consumers are interested 
in -- and willing to buy -- converging products.  A full 31 percent of  
survey respondents expressed a strong interest in buying a combination 
television and personal computer (TV/PC).  Of those interested in 
purchasing a TV/PC, 59 percent said they would conduct word-processing on 
the product, while 50 percent said they would browse the Internet or play 
video games.  When asked where they would purchase a TV/PC, 56 percent 
indicated an electronic superstore such as Best Buy or Circuit City, 
while 18 percent said they would buy their TV/PC at a computer 
superstore.
<br><br>
<b>Conference Program</b>
<br><br>
Spring CES will offer a comprehensive program of conference sessions to 
educate the retailers, buyers, importers/exporters, and analysts in 
attendance.  Among the topics to be covered are:
