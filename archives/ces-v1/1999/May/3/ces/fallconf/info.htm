     <B><FONT FACE="Arial">1998 EIA Fall Conference and CEMA Management
    Forum<BR>
    Growing Industry &amp; Attracting Skilled Workers</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

    <P>The high-technology manufacturing industry currently employees
    more than 1.9 million individuals in the U.S.  That's more jobs
    than the automotive and steel industries combined.  However,
    as electronic industry products and consumer goods have become
    more technically sophisticated, the ability to hire highly skilled
    workers to design, manufacture, distribute, and service these
    products has become a daunting task for many companies.<FONT
     COLOR="#000099">*</FONT></P>

    <P>Education and training for the U.S. workforce may be the single
    most important issue we face as an industry as we approach the
    end of this century. Because of this, the Electronic Industries
    Alliance and CEMA will host several special sessions at this
    year's Fall Conference on workforce development for the 21st
    century.  These sessions are part of a larger Alliance initiative
    for workforce development <BR>
    which will be introduced at the conference.</P>

    <P>Our success in the 21st century depends upon our ability to
    respond now to the growing need for our industry's involvement
    and support in workforce development initiatives, and we strongly
    encourage your company's participation in this event.</P>

    <P>Managers involved with your company's strategic planning,
    human resources, <BR>
    education &amp; training, and market research should plan to
    attend.</P>

    <P><I><FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="-1">*A recent survey revealed
    that 70% of high-tech industry executives see the lack of skilled
    workers as a major barrier to the future growth of their companies.
     Is it a barrier for yours?</FONT></I></P>
