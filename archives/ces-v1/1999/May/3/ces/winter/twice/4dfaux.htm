Faux Dolby Surround From 2 Speakers, Headphones


</b></font></center><br>

More companies have turned up at this year's WCES with technologies that use headphones or two speakers to create the perception of listening to a five-speaker Dolby Digital or Pro Logic soundfield.<br><br>Aureal, JVC, QSound Labs, Sennheiser and Spatializer are among the companies demonstrating these technologies for the first time at a CES. They are joining Virtual Listening Systems, which introduced a headphone-based product at last winter's CES and is here this year with its second headphone product.<br><br>Sennheiser is also demonstrating a headphone-based product, but the other suppliers see their technologies incorporated directly in multimedia PC products, TVs, VCRs, shelf systems, or add-on processors. The suppliers see potential for two-speaker surround systems in small apartments or in such secondary rooms as bedrooms where people might not want to set up five or more speakers.<br><br>JVC has unveiled two home-theater-in-a-box systems incorporating its 3D Phonic technology, but three companies -- Aureal, Q Sound and Spatializer -- plan to license their technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers. <br><br>When incorporated in TVs and other products, all of the technologies limit their full effect to a sweet spot that is narrower than that of a multispeaker surround system. All must be used in conjunction with a Pro Logic or Dolby Digital processor.<br><br>Here's what the companies are doing at WCES:<br><br>* Aureal: The Fremont, Calif., company is demonstrating its VSP901 Virtual Surround Processor chipset, which can be used to reproduce Pro Logic or Dolby Digital soundfields through two speakers. The company plans to license the technology, dubbed A3D. The chipsets will be delivered in the first quarter.<br><br>Strategic alliances VP Toni Schneider said he expects the first wave of A3D products to be TVs, multimedia speakers, and add-on processors for use with TVs and VCRs. Schneider expects the add-ons to be available in 1997, but TVs won't be out until 1998 because TV makers are currently designing their 1998 lines.<br><br>Rockwell has already signed a licensing agreement to use the technology in its own branded consumer products, a spokeswoman added.<br><br>Schneider admitted that the surround effect occurs in a &quot;single-person sweet spot from left to right&quot; but said the effect isn't lost if a listener moves his or her head forward or back. Listeners &quot;can turn their head to 45 degrees before the effect begins to fade out,&quot; he added. When the listener's head turns 90 degrees, the effect is lost.<br><br>&quot;There is a sweet spot issue,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;You must sit in a known position, and you must let the system know where you are for optimal effect. But our sweet spot is as big and smooth as can be, so there is no abrupt on/off effect. You can still get an effect outside the sweet spot, and it diminishes only gradually as you move out of the sweet spot.&quot;<br><br>In a typical home theater situation, he said, &quot;one person would get the full effect, and others would get some effect. It's somewhat better suited for multimedia, but in the home, we found people willing to make the tradeoff. They appreciate the wiring argument more than the price argument. They can buy two high-quality speakers rather than five lower-quality speakers.&quot;<br><br>* JVC: The company's technology, called 3D Phonic, is incorporated in JVC TV sets sold in Europe. But for the U.S., JVC is demonstrating two home-theater-in-a-box systems. <br><br>The SX-PRO3 system consists of two three-way tower speakers, one of which incorporates Dolby Pro Logic and 3D Phonic processors and an amplifier. Its expected retail is $799. The SX-ST1 is a sub/sat system incorporating the electronics in the subwoofer module at an expected $549. Both ship in January.<br><br>* Spatializer Audio Labs: The Woodland Hills, Calif., company is demonstrating its N-2-2 Digital Virtual Surround technology, said to deliver Dolby Pro Logic, Dolby Digital Surround, and MPEG-2 5.1- or 7.1-channel soundfields through two speakers and through headphones. Spatializer claimed its technology yields a wider sweet spot than the others.<br><br>The company also announced that Zoran has agreed to add N-2-2 &quot;with minimal additional cost&quot; to its new Dolby Digital ZR38600 chip at the request of any of its OEM customers.<br><br>* QSound Labs: The company is demonstrating its QSurround technology at a hotel suite. It reproduces &quot;multichannel audio output in the correct spatial relationship on regular two-channel playback equipment,&quot; said president David Gallagher.<br><br>* Sennheiser: The Old Lyme, Conn., company has incorporated VLS's Toltec 3D processor technology in its 8 x 3.2 x 8-inch LUCAS processor, which plugs between any pair of headphones and a TV or HiFi VCR to deliver Dolby Pro Logic soundfields. It comes with two headphone outputs and will be available this month at a suggested $329.<br><br>Frequency response is 20Hz to 18kHz, and the S/N ratio is 85dB.<br><br>* Virtual Listening Systems: The Gainesville, Fla.- based company has introduced its second headphone-based system.
