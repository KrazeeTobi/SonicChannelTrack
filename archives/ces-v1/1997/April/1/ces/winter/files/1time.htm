<center><font size=4><b>First-Time Exhibitors Choose Winter CES<br>for Positive and Upbeat Reasons
</b></font><br><br>Over 22 Percent New Companies Exhibit</center><P>




ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA., December 10, 1996.  With more than 1,800 companies 
exhibiting at the 1997 International Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup>
(CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup>), some 400 companies representing over 22 percent are first-time 
exhibitors at the world's largest annual trade event showcasing consumer 
electronic products.  The 1997 Winter CES is being held in Las Vegas from 
January 9th through the 12th.
<br><br>
All exhibitors including the new exhibiting companies are utilizing the 
nearly one million square feet of exhibit space at the Las Vegas 
Convention Center (LVCC), the Las Vegas Hilton, the Sands Expo and 
Convention Center, and the Alexis Park Hotel.
<br><br>
New companies join up and exhibit at the Winter CES every year with 1997 
experiencing a very positive show of force from the newest WCES rookies.  
As convergence becomes the focal point of a variety of technologies and 
as over 3,000 journalists descend on the show to cover the latest and 
hottest technologies improving consumers' lives, the new exhibitors will 
both contribute and benefit in the success of the 1997 WCES.
<br><br>        
One of the new companies exhibiting is using the WCES to launch its new 
business unit.  Heather Tippett, trade show coordinator for Samsung 
Telecommunications America, Inc. (a part of Samsung Electronics),  
Dallas, Texas,  said, "It's an extremely good show for us to launch our 
brand new business unit focusing on digital wireless telecommunications 
products.  We're the new kid on the block and the WCES is ideal for us to 
gain all the exposure we can with the right distributors, the best 
end-users as well as the media.  We want the industry to know that 
Samsung is a major player in manufacturing and marketing quality cellular 
and paging products, and offers telecom capabilities in addition to its 
traditional consumer electronics expertise."
<br><br>
Another first-time company is Kensington Microwave, Ltd., of San Mateo, 
Calif.  Kathy Kane, vice president of marketing, said "Since Kensington 
is a leader in global computer accessories, Winter CES is a major 
international showcase which allows us to have `one-stop-shopping' with 
our consumer electronics channel of distribution.  In addition, it is the 
ideal stage for introducing our new line of power protection products 
with our customers as well as the tremendous number of media covering the 
show.  Also, we wish to reinforce our global leadership with the trade 
and the business press since all the major media outlets cover the show 
in-depth."
<br><br>
Bob Marsocci, senior manager of communications for DirecTV of  Los 
Angeles, said, "The Winter CES is the foremost international show for 
consumer electronics in the U.S. and the world and it's the perfect venue 
for the fastest growing consumer electronics category.  The stature of 
the attending audience of WCES is critical for us.  It includes many of 
our manufacturing partners such as Hitachi, Magnavox, Panasonic, RCA, 
Sony, Toshiba, Uniden, and others.  Furthermore, we want to continue 
getting the retailers excited about DSS so that we can continue selling 
and marketing our direct broadcast satellite television service into and 
throughout 1997."
<br><br>
"CES offers QUALCOM the proper venue to showcase our progressive family 
of CDMA digital phones to dealers from around the country and the world," 
said Jeffrey K. Belk, director of marketing, QUALCOMM Subscriber Products 
Business Unit.
