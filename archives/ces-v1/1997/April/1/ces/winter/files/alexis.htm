    <b>Specialty Audio Industry Looks to the<br>
       Alexis Park as its Trade Show Venue for 1997</b>

<br><br>
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, September 6, 1996.  Specialty audio manufacturers 
and retailers are looking to the Alexis Park Hotel as their personal 
trade show venue for 1997.  At the International Winter Consumer 
Electronics Show<sup><font size=2>&#174</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size=2>&#174</font></sup>) in Las Vegas, January 9-12, 1997, all companies 
with a specialty audio focus will be located at the Alexis Park.  So far, 
168 specialty audio exhibitors have signed up for approximately 42,000 
square feet of space.  The Alexis Park will host one of the largest 
gatherings of the specialty audio community ever.
<br><br>
"Some of our biggest exhibitors at the Alexis Park include AudioQuest, 
Burmester Audio Systems, Krell Industries, Martin-Logan, Mobile Fidelity 
Sound Labs, TEAC America, Thiel and Vandersteen Audio," said Robbi 
Lycett, Winter CES Show Director.  "So far 1,359 companies have signed up 
for space throughout the four trade show venues [the Las Vegas Convention 
Center, the Sands Expo & Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton and the 
Alexis Park]."
<br><br>
"With the Sahara undergoing major renovations this year, we had to move 
the specialty audio exhibitors to another venue.  Fortunately, we found 
the Alexis Park, a hotel which can offer both exhibitors and attendees 
superior benefits and services," added Lycett.
<br><br>        
Located at 375 East Harmon Avenue, the Alexis Park is 1.75 miles from the 
Las Vegas Convention Center.  The hotel has ample self-parking, valet 
parking, a four-star restaurant, and a multilingual concierge staff.  
There is no casino at the Alexis Park, so finding exhibitor rooms will be 
quick and uncomplicated.  Sleeping rooms are available at the hotel for 
both exhibitors and attendees.
<br><br>
Show management is finalizing promotional plans for the 1997 Winter CES 
and has added many services to balance and enhance traffic flow among all 
trade show facilities.  Some of the plans for the Alexis Park include: 
express shuttle bus service among all CES facilities, a CEMA member 
lounge, on-site housing assistance through the show office, and on-site 
registration.  Other activities to promote the Alexis Park include 
banners at other CES facilities, show hotels and bus shuttle sites 
promoting the Alexis Park and an intensive direct mail campaign.
<br><br>
The 1997 Winter CES Conference Program includes more than 40 sessions 
designed to provide the retailer with the most up-to-date information 
presented by industry experts.  Six of these sessions will be 
specifically geared toward specialty audio retailers:
<br><br>
<UL>
  <LI>Understanding the Music Applications of DVD<br>
  <LI>How to Introduce New People to Specialty Audio<br>
  <LI>The Art of Listening -- How to Conduct Listening Tests with Demos<br>
  <LI>The Changing World of Tube Electronics<br>
  <LI>High-End Accessories -- Do They Make a Difference?
</UL>
<br>
All of the specialty audio sessions will be held at the Alexis Park.  
Moderators and panelists for these sessions will be announced within the 
next few weeks.
<br><br>
All profits from the Winter CES and other CES-sponsored events are 
reinvested into industry services, including media relations programs, 
engineering standards development, market research, vocational training 
and governmental and legal affairs support as directed by the Winter CES 
sponsor and manager, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association 
(CEMA).
