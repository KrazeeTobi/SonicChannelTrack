NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  Convergence plays the key 
"reality" role for the 1997 International Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup>
(CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup>) surrounded by a supporting cast including red hot internet 
technologies, dramatic digital products, and pulsating special-interest 
pavilions.
<br><br>
Convergence, once a mundane technical term meaning "to come together" 
today best describes the coming together of the full spectrum of 
technologies with television companies offering interactive, digital 
Internet capabilities and computer companies offering broadcast and 
entertainment venues. 
<br><br>
Robbi Lycett, Winter CES Show Director, said "This long-anticipated, 
exciting convergence phenomenon is here for buyers and retailers to be a 
part of when the doors open at 10:00 a.m. on January 9, 1997 officially 
kicking off the 1997 CES.  In addition to celebrating 30 years of CES 
shows, the '97 winter show which runs through January 12, 1997, promises 
to offer the most interesting slate of technological, marketing and 
corporate alliances, partnerships, and other coming together progressive 
relationships which are nothing short of terrific for the consumer 
electronics industry."
<br><br>
Converging technologies include DVD, DSS, TV/PC, PCS, multi-media, 
interactive cable, smart phones, pagers, wireless products and more -- 
all with related ancillary products, accessories and support.
<br><br>
The cast for the other surrounding characters for the 1997 Winter CES 
include the debut of the Emerging Technologies Pavilion, the Intelligent 
Transportation System (ITS) Pavilion, Innovations '97 and a supporting 
cast of hundreds led by top names such Casio, Denon, Thomson, Philips, 
Pioneer, Sharp, Sony, and Zenith.  "These pavilions represent the hottest 
emerging technologies coming into the marketplace today.  For buyers and 
retailers to see all of this together in one place at one time and have 
the occasion of being part of this first-hand, is an opportunity that 
simply should not be missed," said Lycett.
<br><br>
Nearly one million square feet of exhibit space has been assigned to more 
than 1500 companies and manufacturers from all over the world.  Featuring 
over 400 new exhibitors, the CES will be located at four major locations: 
the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), the adjoining Las Vegas Hilton, 
the Sands Expo and Convention Center, and the Alexis Park Hotel.
<br><br>
Traditional audio and video products will converge with internet and 
satellite products in the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC).  All major 
DBS manufacturers will exhibit their latest products in this facility.  
Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Philips, Sony, Thomson, and Zenith will 
be demonstrating their latest hot TV/PC and internet products.  Companies 
like JVC and Casio will be showcasing their advanced digital camcorders.  
The latest technologies and products for the small office/home office 
(SoHo) will be showcased by such companies as Brother International, 
Franklin Electronic Publishing, Hewlett-Packard USA, Royal Consumer 
Business Products, and Smith Corona.
<br><br>
In the nearby Las Vegas Hilton will be the headquarters for all home 
theater and home systems manufacturers and marketers.  MB Quart, as part 
of its Domain loudspeaker line, is unveiling a new exciting high-powered 
subwoofer with an interchangeable flip-up top for ease of operation by 
the consumer in home theater scenarios.  Also, Lutron Electronics is 
using the show
to introduce its super new Spacer lighting remote control and dimmer, 
making home entertainment retreats or office environments as custom and 
automatic as desired.  Other companies unveiling equally exciting new 
products at the CES include THX, MTX, Creston, Phast, and X-10 (USA).  
"As products for home entertainment and other home functions become 
popular these companies' integrated home system products are becoming a 
necessity for the home builder and installer," said Lycett.
<br><br>
The Sands Expo and Convention Center will be playing an ever-greater role 
at the '97 CES with about 650 exhibitors in over 500,000 square feet of 
exhibit space including the Emerging Technologies Pavilion (lower level), 
mobile electronics, cellular, paging, wireless, telephone, personal 
electronics, and more.  In addition, Twentieth Century Fox is exhibiting 
in the Sands capitalizing on and showing growing support for the DVD 
introductions expected in 1997.  CIDCO, with its red hot caller ID 
products; AudioVox and Motorola with small, digital telephones, and Tandy 
and others with "Family Radio" are all part of the powerful assembly of 
exciting products being exhibited at the Sands.  Innovations '97, the 
prestigious honors showcase of the best-of-the-best products exhibited, 
is judged by a panel as the ultimate in  design, engineering and software 
excellence. 
<br><br>
The Sands also is host to the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) 
Pavilion.  The ITS, represented by such companies as Etak, Navigation 
Technologies, Rockwell, Siemens, and ITS America, will feature products 
designed to improve passenger and freight efficiency and safety along 
surface transportation modes.  Products will include in-vehicle 
navigation systems, traveler information systems, safety devices, Mayday 
and collision notification systems, and vehicle radar systems.  The 
internet area featuring such companies as Audiotek is a showcase of the 
latest state-of-the-art Internet and world wide web related and support 
products.  As part of its larger presence at the CES, the Sands also is 
serving as the overall overflow arena for all product categories as more 
and more companies catch the fever and sign on.
<br><br>
The Alexis Park Hotel will be the main home for specialty audio for 
companies like AudioQuest, Krell Industries, Martin-Logan, Mobile 
Fidelity, Thiel, and Vandersteen displaying state-of-the-art audio 
advancements.  
<br><br>
A highly-focused comprehensive conference program of over 50 sessions to 
be held at all four main locations consist of eight tracks: new 
technology, Internet, multimedia, SoHo, specialty audio, mobile 
electronics, home theater and general sessions.  Two six-session 
accredited tracks on home systems and retail management also are 
available for $125 or $30 a session.
<br><br>
The keynote speaker for the 1997 International Winter CES is Michael 
Bloomberg, President and founder of Bloomberg Financial Markets.  
Bloomberg will present the prestigious keynote address during the opening 
session on Thursday, January 9 from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m. along with Bob 
Borchardt, president of Recoton and CEMA Chairman and Gary Shapiro, 
president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA).
