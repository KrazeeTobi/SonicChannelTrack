<center><font size=4><b>CES</b><sup><font size=-1>&#174</font></sup><b> Mobile Electronics to Provide Business<br>Tools for Installers & Retailers</b></font><br><P></center>

MEXICO CITY, MEXICO, October 8, 1996.  The seventh annual CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174</font></sup> Mobile 
Electronics '97 -- The 12-Volt Educational Forum will provide superior 
business tools for the mobile electronics world community to enhance 
retailing success.  CES Mobile Electronics is the world's only trade show 
dedicated exclusively to the 12-volt industry and offers a targeted 
educational and international forum for manufacturers of mobile 
electronics products and accessories to conduct business with retailers 
and installers of these products.  The show will be held April 4-6, 1997 
at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
<br><br>
CES Mobile Electronics spotlights some of the most innovative consumer 
electronics products -- car audio, vehicle navigation, vehicle security, 
radar detection, cellular, paging and mobile electronics accessories.  
Aftermarket mobile electronics equipment sales in the United States will 
rise six percent in 1996 to $4.4 billion and 10 percent to $4.8 billion 
by 1997.  As factory installed autosound sales drop to $2.5 billion for 
1996 (from $3.1 billion in 1995) and more vehicle manufacturers offer 
cars with only optional mobile electronics products, retailers should be 
able to capitalize on the trend, boosting sales of the autosound 
aftermarket in particular.
<br><br>
CES Mobile Electronics is the most cost effective platform for retailers 
and installers from around the world to discuss the latest developments 
in the 12-volt industry with the manufacturing community and decide which 
products to buy.  Show management offers a well-rounded, educational 
program that includes installer and management seminars sponsored by 
Installation News as well as retail management seminars sponsored by the 
Mobile Electronics Division of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers 
Association (CEMA).
<br><br>
Since 1991 when the first Mobile Electronics Show debuted with 54 
exhibitors, the show has grown dramatically in size and prestige.  The 
1996 show featured 199 exhibitors, covering more than 90,000 net square 
feet.  With 298 international trade professionals representing 46 
countries, total show attendance stood at 5,516 in 1996.  Already 125 
exhibitors have signed up for the 1997 show, reserving 69,200 net square 
feet of space -- 77 percent of the 1996 show total.
<br><br>
"The 1997 show will offer retailers and installers the latest business 
tools to improve their operations and the hottest products for 
profit-making opportunities," said Karen Chupka, CES Mobile Electronics 
show manager.  "Show management is launching several innovative marketing 
campaigns to increase overall attendance and is further expanding its 
seminar program to provide the mobile electronics retailing community a 
comprehensive educational forum."
<br><br>
Last year more than 100 new products were exhibited at CES Mobile 
Electornics.  The 1997 show should bode just as well with some of the 
world's leading mobile electronics companies already among the list of 
exhibitors: AAMP, Anaba USA, Audio Art, Audiovox, Aura Systems, Boss 
Audio Systems, Cerwin-Vega, Clarion Sales Corp., Clifford Electronics, 
Cobra Electronics Corp., Directed Electronics, Eclipse by Fujitsu Ten, 
International Jensen, Kenwood, Matsushita Consumer Electronics, McIntosh, 
Metra Electronics Corp., MTX, Polk Audio, Precision Interface 
Electronics, and Sherwood America.
