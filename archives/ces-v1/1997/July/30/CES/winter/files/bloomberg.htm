<IMG align=left valign=top SRC="../images/bloompic.jpg">Thank you.  I didn't expect the plug for Larry Ellison, but I'm sure 
he'll be pleased.
<BR><BR>
Thank you for having me.  I've been spending my time in the last couple 
of months going around through Asia and Europe giving as many talks as I 
can trying to get us some publicity and trying to find out what is on our 
customer's minds.  The only problem with doing so is number one you don't 
see your family very much and all of these talks seem to get basicaly the 
same.
<BR><BR>
People always ask you about the same things.  It reminded me when I was 
at Solomon Brothers years ago we had a partner, Henry Kaufman, who was at 
that time arguably the world's greatest, or certainly the world's most 
known, economist who went every day and gave talk after talk after talk.  
And basically all his talks were exactly the same thing and one day 
supposedly his driver said to him "Dr. Kaufman I have heard your talk so 
many times I think I could give it myself."   Well, Henry, who was noted 
for his wit, said "Oh yeah, tell you what.  We're going to another talk 
this afternoon,  Why don't you give it."  So before they went in Henry 
took the driver's cap and the driver's limosine pin, put it on.  Henry 
sat down on the side and the driver stood up and gave, in all fairness, 
what was a very creditable talk.  And afterwards everybody stood up and 
applauded and it was very well received.  There was one minor problem 
that nobody had really thought about.  Some guy in the back stood up and 
asked a question and it was some question about the flat tax and gold 
standard and monetary policy and it was a very convoluted complex kind of 
thing and Henry down front here just had this panicked look on his face.  
The driver thought for a second, looked at the guy in the back and said 
"You know sir, that is the stupidest question I have ever heard.  Even my 
driver could answer that."  I don't know if it happened but it's a good 
story.
<BR><BR>
Anyway thank you for having me. Gary asked me to tell you what the future 
is going to be and I'm not so sure that I can do that any better or any 
worse than anybody else.  My great contribution is that I am a consumer.  
I am a 55 year old consumer and I have a few problems.  Number one is I 
cannot see and all of you people keep producing devices where the letters 
and numbers are much too small for me to read and the buttons are too 
small for my big fingers.  And I think that one of the great challenges 
we have is how do we solve those kinds of problems, how do we build 
products that are really a little more practical.
<BR><BR>
There is a great danger when you are building something and it is 
certainly true in my business as well as yours that you get carried away 
with your own brilliance.  The world is littered, the graveyards are 
littered with products that reflected the designer's brilliance but 
weren't really practical for the average person and we have got to go and 
say what is in our customer's interest  If you think about it, our 
customers -- and that's true of almost any industry that we are in -- do 
not care what we have to sell.  They only care what we have that they 
want and I keep telling my sales force again and again and again go in 
and don't demonstrate our product.  The person on the other side of the 
desk doesn't care.  They have families to feed, they have insecurities 
they've got to worry about.  Those people only care how we can help them. 
 People are lazy.  People are selfish and that's just the real world.  We 
are just as much as they are.  So when you go in, do your research 
before, figure out what we have that that man or woman wants. And the 
same thing is true in a store with a consumer product.  When a customer 
walks in the question is what do you have that the customer wants to buy. 
 The customer doesn't care what you want to sell.  And we live in a very 
difficult world, a very competitive world.  
<BR><BR>
But it is a crazy world if you think about it. This past year there were 
1 1/2 million citizens band radios sold in the United States.  I think 
most people would have assumed there were zero citizens band radios sold 
in the United States.  There really is a market out there for something 
that most people wouldn't have assumed existed.  I just came back with my 
kids from Vale.  One of the hottest selling things in Vale, Colorado on 
the ski slopes is bottled water.  How can you sell bottled water when you 
are surrounded by all this white stuff?  And yet that is exactly what 
happens, none of us really would have predicted, but the fact of the 
matter is there is something about bottled water, whether it is in the 
packaging or the convenience or there is an implied health thing that 
people really want to buy.  There is a demand pull there.  Nobody stood 
up and said I think skiiers are going to  want to buy bottled water.
<BR><BR>
We live in a world, remember, where 250 million people watch Baywatch.  
Baywatch is a television sitcom, for those of you who are not familiar 
with it, where there are half a dozen nubile young ladies in bikinis and 
half a dozen very muscular young men in thong bathing suits.  And they 
save somebody drowning in the Pacific Ocean, and they do this every 
single week.  So maybe the most amazing thing is that somebody can come 
up with a script every week to do that.  Although I am not so sure there 
is a script, nobody would know whether there was or wasn't.  The dialogue 
isn't exactly what brings you to this television show.
<BR><BR>
But there is a demand out there.  What people want is not necessarily 
what we the rest of the world think they want.  They are going to tell us 
and if there is one thing that I keep worrying about in my origanization 
is that we're going to think that we are smarter than these other people. 
 We are not smarter than they are.  These people out there want certain 
products that make no sense whatsoever but they are running the 
marketplace.  And what we have got to do is go out there, understand that 
and say "OK let's give them what they really want".  Let me give you some 
examples:  One of the real problems with radio is that we have not 
improved it in any meaningful sense in years.  If I want Country and 
Western music I still have to go and try to figure out where it is on the 
dial.  There is no way to stick in CW and get Country and Western music 
and if I do find Country and Western music on my radio, when I drive 
through the tunnel the radio does not work any more.  And when I drive a 
hundred miles the station fades out.  So what we have got to do is figure 
out some way and whether it is satellite delivered or whether it is 
derivation of the cellular phone or any one of a variety of ways, we have 
got to figure out how to make the radio more friendly.
<BR><BR>
The same thing is true with the newspaper.  If you think about a 
newspaper, a newspaper is the way that we still get most of our news.  I 
know we spent trillions of dollars on electronic delivery of information 
over the airwaves and over cable and from satellites and microwaves and 
over the telephone but the fact of the matter is most people in this room 
today will get most of their news from newspapers.  And in fact when 
you're getting your news from radio and television the news agenda for 
the radio and television stations has been set by the local newspapers.  
The question is:  What is it about newspapers that keeps them out there?  
We have had them since Guttenburg days.  Shakespeare times people read 
newspapers.  Today, Beavis and Buthead times, we are still reading 
newspapers.  We are not using all this electronic equipment that we have. 
 Why?  Well, newspapers have a handful of characteristics that the public 
really finds valuable.  Number one, newspapers are random access devices. 
 I said before we are all lazy.  If I want the sports, I do not want to 
sit and listen to the international news.  I do not want to sit and 
listen to the local news, then a commercial, then the weather guy, then a 
commercial, then a lifestyle piece and then get to my sports.  I want to 
go straight to the sports.  Newspapers let you do that.  And if radio and 
television is really going to compete with newspapers, they have to find 
a way to convert from being a sequential access device to being a random 
access device, like a newspaper.
<BR><BR>
And in fact that's where all the monies are spent.  DVD and all of the 
digital delivery over computers of radio and television are really trying 
to make those two devices more like a newspaper or more like have this 
characteristic of a newspaper that is so useful.  Newspapers do something 
else.  Newspapers provide you with the information that you need but 
weren't smart enough to ask for.  Now I know everybody says "God, 
wouldn't it be great if we could have a way where we could only get the 
news that is of importance to us."  There's a minor problem with that.  
How do you know in advance what information is going to be important to 
you.  Or, I don't want war stories.  There's another Bosnia story every 
day and I can't figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are, so in 
my computer when I select what kind of news I am going to get, I do not 
put a check mark next to war.  Of course if World War III breaks out I am 
in big trouble because I did not know about it.
<BR><BR>
Or Susan Smith, I do not how many of you remember who Susan Smith was.  
Susan Smith was this very sick woman who put her two children in the back 
of her car and drove it into a lake.  I do not think any of us would of 
thought that we could of lasted at the water cooler without knowing about 
Susan Smith.  The problem is with the Susan Smiths of the world is that 
many, many times in the course of a year a parent kills two or more of 
their own children in this country.  And so if I said well I want the 
Susan Smith story I am going to be inundated with them and the fact of 
the matter is most of them are not newsworthy, unfortunately, but there 
is just so many of them.  What made the Susan Smith story so germain and 
all of the other tragedies not of any interest---luck, no other news in 
the newspaper that day, what ever it was.
<BR><BR>
But somehow or other if in advance I try to specify whether the Susan 
Smith story is going to be of interest or whether the war story is going 
to be of interest.  It is a lot more difficult to do and I am probably 
not going to be able to do it myself.  So what I do, what you do, is you 
hire somebody to make those decisions, you hire a human being.  And that 
human being gets a title of front page editor, if you will, or news 
director.  And that person makes the judgements for us.
<BR><BR>
Now let's go back to the newspaper.  I wanted to go directly to the 
sports.  But one of the great attributes that newspapers have, and that 
radio and television is going to have to pick up if they want to compete 
with newspapers, is they are going to have to figure out a way to tell 
you what you need to know even when you did not ask for it when that 
human being decided it was in your interest.  In the newspapers you do it 
by big headlines.  So when I am turning to the sports section if World 
War III broke out I could not help but see the headline.  Catches my eye, 
maybe I read the story, worst case I just remember the headline.  But 
newspapers have this great characteristic of keeping you informed when 
you are too lazy to ask and to do all the work.
<BR><BR>
And if we are going to build consumer products, if our businesses are 
going to grow and let electronic devices replace newspapers they are 
going to have to provide the same functionality.  Now another answer to 
the problem would be don't let radio and television become the substitute 
for newspapers.  But find some way to make newspapers more valuable, more 
economic.  And if you think about it, it is a very easy thing to do.  
Right now we go and we chop down an awful lot of trees in Canada, we haul 
them to the mill, we grind them up into paper, we put ink on it, we 
deliver it to the corner newspaper stand or the newspaper boy or girl 
throws it on your doorstep. You read it once and you throw it away.  It 
is a phenomenally inefficient thing screaming for a technological 
solution.  And, in fact, people are working on this.  It may be two or 
three years or five years from now, but the newspaper of the future is an 
electronic device.  You cannot continue to transmit information by truck. 
 You have to do that in this day and age digitally over the air or over 
cable or over your phone line.  But the presentation is not going to be 
on paper, it is just too inefficient.  The newspaper of a few years from 
now is made of cloth with transitors hidden in it and essentially a 
cellular phone on a chip with a tiny battery hidden there as well.  And 
so over the air comes the information.  But the display device still 
looks like a newspaper.  Why?  Because the characteristics that we said a 
newspaper had that made it so valuable, namely random access, your eye 
can go to really instantly where it wants to, and also the ability to see 
things that you didn't ask for at the same times and absorb information 
peripherally.
<BR><BR>
Those things require a large display device.  Now, once you get this 
going, is it a newspaper?  Is it characteristic of a newspaper the broad 
sheet display or the fact that you had to chop down trees?  I would argue 
it is certainly the former and not the latter.  Now, what happens to 
people that work in newspapers?  Well you still need reporters, you still 
need editors, you still need photographers, you still need advertising 
salesmen.  The creative people in newspapers are still going to keep 
their jobs.  And interestingly enough from a technological point of view, 
they are going to have better jobs and they are going to be more in 
demand.  Why? Because the electronic newspaper is a demonstratively 
better product.  
<BR><BR>
When I am here in Las Vegas, if I want my home town newspaper, I just 
squeeze the top hand right corner of my cloth page and it lists every 
newspaper in the world that I subscribe to, all of which are sent down 
electronically and only come to my device if I have paid the freight and 
there I can get my home town newspaper.  I can even get it better than I 
used to when I was back at home.  Because when the reporter writes the 
story it's available instantly.  I do not have to wait for that cycle of 
it being set, typed up and type set and printed and delivered.  So the 
electronic delivery of this information will make newspapers more 
valuable, which means that people working in the newspaper industry will 
have more jobs, more valuable jobs, will get paid better, will have more 
satisifaction than they did before.
<BR><BR>
And this is just a model I think for a lot of the kinds of things that we 
are all working on.  You have got to sit back and say "Look there is 
nothing magical about radio or television, what does the consumer want?"  
The consumer wants something that they can pick up and fold and carry 
around.  The consumer wants something in which they can see multiple 
things at same time.  The consumer wants something that is much cheaper 
and electronic delivery of one time information when you have to buy one 
delivery device rather than buying that delivery device made of paper 
everyday clearly would be much cheaper.  If we can do that with 
newspapers we can do that with a lot of products.
<BR><BR>
The second product that clearly this is going to happen with is 
television.  No matter how many times people tell you that broadcast is 
here to stay, the fact of the matter is it is not here to stay.  It is so 
compelling to be able to get what you want, when you want it, independent 
of everybody else that we are going to give you video on demand no matter 
what it costs and no matter who's axe gets gored and people will try to 
protect their industries.  They will try to protect their jobs, but the 
fact of the matter is, if you look at the public, the public has the 
interest in getting a movie they go to Blockbuster, they want to see it 
when they want to see it.  The public even goes to the corner movie 
theater to see it when they want to see it.  The public wants to be able 
to jump over commercials, which is going to be a very big problem.  Who 
is going to pay for all of this?  The public wants to be able to stop 
that football game for two minutes when the phone rings or when the 
diaper needs changing.  And we are going to have to deliver those kinds 
of products, those facilities, those attributes for television.
<BR><BR>
How is it going to work?  It is going to be digital, the model is out 
there with the Internet,  It is not going to come over the Internet.  It 
will come over single purpose intranets.  The argument of is it going to 
be television or is it going to be PC is a semantic argument that we will 
look back on and laugh how could we be so stupid to ever even talk about 
that in 1997.  Two years from now nobody's going to know the difference.
<BR><BR>
Now this doesn't mean that Intel and Microsoft are going to be out of 
business or that Larry Ellison is going to own the world.  The fact of 
the matter is there are different businesses out there, different needs 
and we have got to produce products to two different kinds of markets 
that we all seem to confuse here.
<BR><BR>
One is the business market or the serious person who needs spreadsheets 
and word processing packages, database packages, e-mail and that sort of 
stuff.  There are a lot of those people and it's a great business 
building products for them and you can constantly make those products 
better and even maybe charge more money.  If you think about it, the cost 
of PCs really has not come down, we just keep adding functionality.  At 
some point in time the public is not going to recognize the extra 
functionality and we are going to get in real trouble and that is when 
the price of PCs will plummet.  But fundamentally there is this 
professional market.
<BR><BR>
Most of the people, however, watch Baywatch.  That 250 million people I 
talked about in the world that watch Baywatch every week, incidentaly 
Beverly Hills 90210 is second with 125 million, those people come home 
from work they're tired, they have an argument with their spouse, hate 
the kid, don't like dinner, they want to put their feet up and there is 
only one kind of information that they want to manipulate.  They do not 
want to go get some data on ancient Mesopotamia and write a term paper.  
They do not want to sit down and pay their bills electronically.  I mean 
everybody I know wants to pay them slower not faster.  What these people 
want to do is take some information, sort it, manipulate it and select 
something from it and then do something with the data.  But the 
information that they want to manipulate is TV listings.  That is the 
only data most people want to use at night.
<BR><BR>
I am not saying there is not this market for fancy PCs for people that 
want to get on the net, that want to have chat lines, that want to look 
up facts and write papers and create their own television programs and 
their own radio. There is that market.
<BR><BR>
But the big consumer market is for the killer application is video on 
demand so that people can find Baywatch and watch Baywatch.  And that is 
where the TV appliances, the PC appliances, the Internet appliances, no 
matter what terminology you want to use, that is what those people are 
going to buy.  And you ca not stop it, because the demand is there.  
These people, no matter what we tell them, want something that is simple 
to use.
<BR><BR>
We can no longer give them five different remote controls like I have at 
home.  I have one for the stereo, one for the cable, one for the 
satellite, one for the television and one for the VCR.  And in most of my 
rooms I have bought a very expensive device that combines it all, except 
that the light is not good enough and the buttons are too small for me to 
actually use the damn thing.  Got to do something about that.  There is a 
consumer interest out there and in my business just as in your business 
the real challange that we face is to try to find what does the consumer 
want and satisify that and not get confused with what we would like the 
consumer to want.  Just because it is easy for us to manufacture 
something, just because we already have on our shelves a certain kind of 
product, all the wishing in the world is not going to make the customer 
want to buy that.  You have got to sit down and really be honest and it 
is a very difficult thing to do.  If you do not, you're just going to get 
chewed up.
<BR><BR>
The other thought I would like to leave you with is the following:  I 
said technology in newspapers is going to make newspapers better and 
create more jobs and make the people working in newspapers have more 
value, and I think that is true for all of us.  If you make better 
products you will have a better life.  You will keep your job, your 
company will do better, more people will want you.  If you are a good 
salesman you are going to be more in demand in the future, not less.  
Technology has a history of creation as opposed to destruction.  And we 
have got to be very careful that we do not think of technology as 
something that is out there and that's on it's own and that deserves it's 
own homage.  Because that is not the real case.
<BR><BR>
We are making a terrible mistake in our school systems of trying to teach 
our kids about technology at the expense of teaching them how to read, 
how to write, how to get along with other people, how to work hard.  We 
have got to be very careful that we do not get carried away.
<BR><BR>
All of that is the height that comes out of what we want to sell as 
opposed to sitting back and seeing what the consumer wants or in the case 
of our kids what our kids need.  Unfortunately, in the school systems 
there is a certain amount of money, that is not going to grow,  If 
anything, the political process at the moment tries to reduce that amount 
of money.
<BR><BR>
So we have two choices, we can have better and more teachers or we can 
have some photo opportunities for politicians hooking that classroom up 
to the net.
<BR><BR>
And what you are going to do as manufacturers is increase the internal 
complexity of all of your products so that the rest of us who are 
consumers see something, you are going to make the internal more complex 
so that we who look at the external part of your products see something 
simpler.  And with time your products will get easier for us to use, we 
will have to have less specialized knowledge to use them, they will 
provide more functionality for us and we will be better customers of 
yours.
<BR><BR>
So thank you very much for having me.
