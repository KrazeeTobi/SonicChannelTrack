1997 Winter CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup> - Opening Session
        </b></font><br><br></center>


<IMG align=left valign=top SRC="../images/gary.gif">Good morning and welcome to the 1997 Winter Consumer Electronics Show. 
Thirty years ago,
the first CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup> was held in New York City.  We have special guests today
who were at that first
show.  Can you please stand.  We recognize your longevity in a tough but
exciting industry.
<BR><BR>
The first CES was less than one-tenth of our size today.  One hundred
companies exhibited and
17,000 people attended. 
<BR><BR>
The CES and our industry have grown together.  The players have changed,
but our philosophy
has remained consistent.  The CES must serve the industry by bringing
all the players together in
a cost effective format.  And this format must be open to new players.  
<BR><BR>
At the first association board meeting I attended in 1981, board
chairman Ray Gates of
Panasonic, then the largest CES exhibitor, expressed this philosophy
during a discussion on
whether we should increase the charge to exhibitors.  He said, and the
board agreed, that we must
maintain the CES so a person with an idea can come to the CES and for a
few thousand dollars 
expose a new product to thousands of retailers and media.  
<BR><BR>
Since then, the entrepreneur has had a special place at CES and that's
why we keep the CES 
focused on new products and technologies.  We have a special pavilion
for emerging companies;
the Innovations exhibit at the Sands features the industry's most
creative products and special
pavilions for internet and intelligent transportation systems.
<BR><BR>
And because we are open to those with good ideas, our industry has
always had significant
growth and revolutionary products and technologies.
<BR><BR>
We have seen the VCR, camcorder, CD, pagers, cellular phone, fax
machine, home computer
and other products burst forth at CES like crops from a fertile field. 
During these past thirty
years our industry has coined phrases that are now an everyday part of
the American lexicom, 
such as home theater, multimedia and home office.
<BR><BR>
These products have changed the way we work, play and communicate.  They
have evolved from
a luxury purchase to a household necessity.  Can anyone imagine life
without personal
computers, camcorders, and VCRs?  I certainly cannot, and our children
certainly know of no
other lifestyle.
<BR><BR>
In 1967 many of these products didn't exist, not even on the drawing
boards.  But, we had
visions and visionaries.  Akio Morita, K. Matsushita and Andre Blay are
among the people who
brought us the VCR, the Walkman and prerecorded videotape.  Now there
are new names and
faces...Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Larry Ellison, Stan Hubbard, Eddy
Hartenstein and Joe Clayton. 
These leaders are playing an integral role in the development and
marketing of new technologies
and innovations.   
<BR><BR>
Over these past 30 years, the consumer electronics industry has thrived
and prospered.   In 1967, 
industry sales were 4.3 billion dollars. We have flourished to become a
65 billion dollar industry. 
That is a remarkable increase of more than fifteen hundred percent in 30
years. 
<BR><BR>
While it is fun to reminisce,  we must to look ahead.  What will the
world of consumer
electronics look like in five years?  What products will be introduced
at the 2002 Winter CES?
Maybe some brilliant visionaries and product developers know, but I
certainly don't.  What I do
know, is these products - whatever they may be - will continue to
improve our lives.
<BR><BR>
What we need to remember is that we are selling products, not hype. 
Every year, this industry
conjures up a new buzz word and often they fly out as quickly as they
flew in.  This year, the
buzz word is convergence.  A couple of years ago we were all abuzz about
the super highway -
how we would receive telephone over cable and movies over phone lines. 
But, While everyone
was talking abut this road to the future, DBS snuck in and paved the
way.  This real product has
been one of the true successes for this industry.  According to a survey
we are releasing shortly,
is dramatically cutting into cable revenue.  In fact, our survey shows
that 64 percent of DSS
subscribers drop cable totally. 
<BR><BR>
So, my advice is to not accept blindly the current view of technology
Today many of the
technologically vogue believe that the PC will replace the television as
the focal point of the
home entertainment system.  I disagree.  But ultimately consumers will
make this choice.
<BR><BR>
They will decide which product is easiest to use, provides the best
services and the most benefits,
and offers the top value.  
<BR><BR>
While I believe there are enough eyeballs to go around for the
television and computer industries 
to benefit, we must continue to create exciting and compelling
products.  HDTV and DVD are
two such products.  Separately and together, HDTV and DVD will give
consumers the
entertainment experience they now only dream about.
<BR><BR>
Computers and televisions will continue to converge and evolve into new
and exciting
entertainment and productivity products. This is why we have teamed up
with Softbank to bring
together the Spring CES and Spring Comdex shows in Atlanta in June.
<BR><BR>
Your trade association, like its members, must be willing to push the
envelope to think in non-traditional ways.  We need your help in this
effort.  
<BR><BR>
Indeed, to get a different perspective we have created a consumer
electronics manufacturers
advisory council, comprised of some 50 leaders of national organizations
such as the American
Red Cross, the 4-H, the American Federation of Teachers, the Humane
Society and several other
groups.  These CEO's are with us in Las Vegas this week to learn about
our industry, to share
their thoughts and hopefully, to give us insights to fulfill our
obligation to you - to make the best
industry even better.
<BR><BR>
But, before we look too far ahead, lets not forget about the reason we
are all here.  When you go 
on to the show floor in a few minutes, you will see over eighteen
hundred exhibits and thousands
of exciting products.  In fact, this year's show is over 100,000 square
feet larger than last year's
show. As you walk the aisles, keep in mind that these are the products
that will help grow this
business.  These are the products that will drive customers into your
stores. These are the
products that will take us all into the 21st century. 
<BR><BR>
I am especially pleased to turn the microphone over to CEMA's top
volunteer.  One week ago,
Bob Borchardt began his term as chair of CEMA's Board and Executive
Committee   As CEO of
a leading American consumer electronics company, Bob ascendency to this
position is a tribute
to fundamental changes at CEMA, tremendous growth and success at Recoton
and Bob's
powerful vision and leadership.   CEMA has tripled its membership in six
years and has focused
on serving the needs of American companies, large and small, in the
consumer electronics
industry.   Bob Borchardt has been a vocal advocate of this focus and
growth.  
<BR><BR>
Bob has spent the past 36 years with Recoton.   During his reign,
Recoton has acquired 11 other
firms including Discwasher and is now the industry's largest accessory
company.  This year,
Recoton entered the audio business by acquiring International Jensen and
its many highly
recognized brands.   Recoton currently manufacturers and markets 18
brand names with over
3,700 products.  Ladies and gentleman, please welcome my friend, CEMA
chairman and
Reconton CEO, Bob Borchardt.
