NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 21, 1996.  Representing more than 500,000 
square feet of exhibit space, conferences, publications, associations, 
Innovations `97 and specially-dedicated technology pavilions at the 1997 
Winter Consumer Electronics Show<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup> (CES<sup><font size=-1>&#174;</font></sup>), the Sands Expo and Convention 
Center is a major trade show by itself.
<br><br>
Instead, the use of the Sands comprehensive complex has grown over 150 
percent from the 1996 show into one of the largest parts of the Winter 
CES with more than 650 exhibitors.  It is a full service facility 
complete with all exhibitors and attendee services that are expected at 
CES.  The Las Vegas Convention Center, the traditional CES anchor 
facility with audio, video, computer, multimedia and more, while the Las 
Vegas Hilton is host to home theater and home automation, and the Alexis 
Park is home to specialty and high-end audio.  Meanwhile, the Sands also 
is host to the prestigious Innovations '97, the annual showcase of 
design, engineering and software excellence in consumer electronics in 
addition to special technology pavilions.
<br><br>        
Housing the mammoth 160,000 square feet of mobile electronics (the 
world's largest trade-only exposition for the mobile electronics 
industry) the Sands upper level also is home to wireless communications 
as well as cellular, paging, telephone products and Innovations `97.  In 
addition to publications, trade associations, the Sands' main level 
contains personal electronics, watches, health care products, adult 
software, retail resource, and serves as the all-important Winter CES 
overflow area for audio and video hardware and accessories as companies 
continue to join up.
<br><br>
Jonathan Thompson, Vice President of the Consumer Electronic Shows, said 
"the outstanding growth of the mobile electronics category told us that 
we needed to move it into a dedicated area surrounded by other logical 
categories like cellular, telephony, paging and wireless products.  This 
new grouping of categories is an incredible draw by itself."
<br><br>
Key exhibitors in the cellular, paging, wireless and telephony areas at 
the Sands include such industry giants as Motorola, Ericsson, Samsung 
Cellular, Nokia, PageMart, PageNet, and Pacific Bell Mobile Services as 
well as the hot caller ID manufacturers CIDCO and Colonial Data.  This 
portion of the show represents some of the largest growth areas in terms 
of exhibitors and exhibit space for the Show.  In addition, this is the 
largest tradeshow for wireless, telephony and cellular retail products in 
the U.S.
<br><br>
The Sands Expo and Convention Center also is an even greater drawing card 
by hosting such show stoppers as the first-time Winter CES Emerging 
Technologies Pavilion, and the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) 
Pavilion, in addition to Innovations '97.
<br><br>
Located on the lower level, the Emerging Technologies Pavilion will focus 
on new and exciting technologies from small manufacturers.  Eligible 
companies such as Centerpin and Heartronics that produce less than $2 
million, have never had a CES booth larger than the basic 10' x 10', and 
have fewer than 15 employees.  As part of the pavilion, these companies 
will gain exposure from the nearly 80,000 retailers investors, 
financiers, venture capitalists, and media.  
<br><br>
The ITS Pavilion, represented by such companies as Etak, Navigation 
Technologies, Rockwell, Siemens, and ITS America will feature products 
designed to improve passenger and freight efficiency and safety along 
surface transportation modes.  Products will include in-vehicle 
navigation systems, traveler information systems, safety devices, Mayday 
and collision notification 
systems, and vehicle radar systems.  The internet area featuring Audiotek 
is a showcase of the latest state-of-the-art Internet and world wide web 
related and support products.  
<br><br>
Innovations `97 includes those "best-in-class" products that are winners 
in the Innovations `97 Design & Engineering Honors Program.  These select 
product winners are honored as the most prestigious product and design 
advancements at the 1997 Winter CES.
