Dealers At Winter CES Are Web Knowledgeable


</b></font></center><br>


Consumer electronics retailers are by and large Internet savvy and make good use of the communications technology in their businesses. Most of those who don't yet hook into the World Wide Web plan to do so, but apparently have expectations that won't be realized.<BR><BR>All that is indicated by the results of an exclusive TWICE on-floor survey conducted yesterday here at the Winter CES.<BR><BR>Fully 65% of retailers queried say they now use the Internet in their businesses, and by far the most common use -- cited by an overwhelming 92% -- turns out to be e-mail.<BR><BR>But an almost equally dominating 85% go online to pick up industry news updates and to contact their suppliers. Contact with customers is an application mentioned by 69%, and 53% say they log on to check out the Web sites of their competition.<BR><BR>Of those who said they do not use the Internet in their businesses, 71% are planning, or at least considering, doing so. But what they plan to use it for differs significantly from how the Internet is being used by the current online crowd.<BR><BR>The percentage of non-users who feel they will be using the Internet to get industry news updates and make contact with suppliers and/or customers approximates that of users.<BR><BR>But only 40% of non-users see themselves sending and receiving information via e-mail, and 80% expect the Internet to help them keep tabs on the competition.<BR><BR>Incidental to the Web-related survey results, TWICE  uncovered the fact that many specialty retailers are looking to expand their horizons, for example,  autosound specialists looking to get into home theater or audio dealers eyeing satellite.<BR><BR>Among that crowd, the most attractive single add-on proved to be DVD players, followed closely by direct-to-home satellite systems. Web browser adapters and car navigation also drew significant interest.
