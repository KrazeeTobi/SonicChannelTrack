DirecTV To Launch DSS Service For Computers In 4th Quarter

</b></font></center><br>



DirecTv CEO Eddy Hartenstein reports his company will launch its DSS-delivered interactive services for PCs in the fourth quarter and is showing a working sample of the system at its booth here.<BR><BR>"There are 30 million PC households in the country, and this is a new platform that will give us yet another new avenue of distribution to bring DirecTv entertainment and new broadcast data entertainment to people's homes," Hartenstein said. "It is an entertainment-based service that is going to create a standard in the way both interactive multimedia and Internet content is experienced on people's PCs in the home."<BR><BR>In addition to all the video programming currently available through DirecTv, this new service is going to offer four or five new categories of distinct types of video and data programming:<BR><BR>* Data-enhanced video services will enable current video and audio services to be enriched with graphics and text to provide more detailed information related to the program.<BR><BR>* Online multimedia magazines will be available from leading publishers, providing articles enhanced with MPEG-2 video clips and animated graphics.<BR><BR>* A "best of the Web" feature will gather the most popular Web sites, regularly collect updated information, and deliver that information to the PC in a "near data-on-demand fashion."<BR><BR>* A real-time data ticker will screen information from stock markets, sports and weather reports.<BR><BR>* And software downloads and electronic transfers of popular titles can be delivered directly to users in a fast and secure environment.<BR><BR>Hartenstein said that just as DirecTv assembled a team of hardware manufacturers for the launch of television-related DSS service, it is now assembling a team of leading companies as "partners" with DirecTv in developing the content and platforms for the interactive data applications.<BR><BR>"We licensed Microsoft last year with all the software enabling DSS to be integrated into the Windows 95 operating system, and since then we have had discussions with several other companies that have expressed interest in being a part of this," Hartenstein said. "We are talking to IBM, Gateway and other leading PC manufacturers that plan to integrate DSS technology into their multimedia PCs so that they can receive DirecTv services."<BR><BR>DirecTv has agreements with three PC board manufacturers -- Hughes Network Systems, Adaptec and ComStream -- to design and manufacture PC tuner boards that will replace the set-top box for PC use.<BR><BR>VLSI Technology, a leading Silicon Valley microchip manufacturers, is working with DirecTv to develop the data-encryption hardware. STB Systems will design digital video subsystems that will enable the broadcast quality video programming to be received in the PC.
