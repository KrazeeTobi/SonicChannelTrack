Survey Gives Mixed Signals On Web Browsers

</b></font></center><br>


Consumers either are, or aren't, wildly enthusiastic about the chance to surf the Internet through their color TV. It just depends on what group of consumers you survey.
<BR><BR>Dataquest, the San Jose, Calif., high-tech research firm, said that results of a survey it conducted show that 93% of consumers polled have no interest in buying an Internet-ready TV or a set-top adapter.
<BR><BR>Sega, however, said a study it commissioned through Impulse Research shows that a majority of video game console owners would be interested in buying an adapter that would give them Internet access.
<BR><BR>Sega, which has a $199 modem adapter for its Saturn game console   and which plans to have games available online this year   said its survey shows 61% of game players want through-game access to the Internet and would play networked games. An equal percentage of Sega's survey respondents said they would be willing to pay $200 for the adapter because it would make it unnecessary to buy a PC and allow them to play on a bigger screen.
<BR><BR>But according to Dataquest director Van Baker, its study shows that the TV Internet device as currently positioned "does not have significant market potential." The results of the study are covered in a report titled ËInternet TV   The Next Boom Or A Repeat Of The Interactive TV Disaster?
<BR><BR>"The interface and usability of the device leaves a lot of room for improvement, and the value to the consumer, especially the non-PC household, is questionable," Baker said. 
<BR><BR>Although the industry is aiming its products to non-PC households, he noted, "the survey shows that households that have a PC are more likely to purchase an Internet TV than are non-PC households."
<BR><BR>The market does have potential for success, Baker said, but what is needed is an access system that will tailor itself to the interests of individual users, and so avoids the Internet's clutter and confusion.
<BR><BR>More localized information also would improve the attraction, said Baker, "If a consumer could turn to an easily retrievable Web page to determine the local weather forecast, local restaurant reviews, or movie listings for local theaters, the value of the content grows in importance."
