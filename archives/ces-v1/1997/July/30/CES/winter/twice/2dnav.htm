More Work To Be Done Before<BR>
Car Navigation Sales Grow

</b></font></center><br>


Perhaps one vendor was on to something when he suggested navigation would catch on in the U.S. if everyone stopped calling it navigation.
<BR><BR>The technology, which is a significant success in Tokyo due to the city's unruly street and address system, has been introduced in this country, but hasn't been embraced by mainstream America.
<BR><BR> Navigation is in its infancy here, but in Japan more than 23 companies are competing in this industry, according to T.K. Kutsuzawa, Alpine's senior VP of sales and marketing.
<BR><BR> The vendor, in fact, launched its own Advanced Route Guidance GPS system late last year for the California market partnering with The Good Guys for its retail rollout.
 Maybe the largest stumbling block for navigation, some vendors sense, is the way the product is being positioned, or at least the way consumers perceive it   as a tool for when you get lost.
 <BR><BR>Quite the contrary, challenged key vendors who pointed out its uses as a pseudo Yellow Pages with its copious listings of hotels, gas stations, ATMs and hospitals.
 <BR><BR>"The challenge is to prove the system is viable for everyday operation and not just when you're lost," said Kutsuzawa. "It has benefits as a time saver."
 <BR><BR>Even with navigation's many attributes, vendors must now turn retailers into believers before they can ultimately sell consumers this costly instrument.
 <BR><BR>Global Positioning Systems (GPS) on the market right now start at retail prices of $1,599 and range up to $3,000.
 <BR><BR>While it's pricey, so are all dawning inventions, contended vendors. And true to new technologies, as they become more prevalent, the price will eventually come down.
 <BR><BR>According to Mark Weir, product planning manager for Sony MobileComm, the mainstream consumer will find navigation affordable after the year 2000.
 <BR><BR>"It depends what you mean when you talk about navigation: CD-ROM, GPS, visual display, LCD color technology   certain cost levels will not change until the foundation technologies become less expensive," he said.
 <BR><BR>"Navigation is still too new; it's not a category you can enter lightly," Weir continued.
 <BR><BR>Sony was one of the first to introduce in-vehicle mobile navigation in the U.S. aftermarket last year, when it introduced its next-generation NVX-F30 and GPX-5, also known as Columbus.
<BR><BR> Sony's NVX-F160, their first system in the U.S. to combine advanced GPS technology for navigation, detailed digital maps and information on hotels and entertainment options, operates with EtakGuide USA software which made Sony one of the first vendors to offer map coverage of the continental U.S. and street coverage of 32 major cities, all on a single disc.
 <BR><BR>In addition to Alpine and Sony, other leading vendors are established in navigation.
 <BR><BR>Clarion, for instance, shipped its first navigation systems in 1995. Last year, Clarion offered a good-better-best lineup including the entry-level VRN1100, the TELEPATH 100 and the NAX9100.
 <BR><BR>Others in the market include EX2 which presented its first navigation system, the Beacon, last year; Rockwell's Pathmaster system which offers a retail version of a its system launched through Oldsmobile and rental car companies; and Audiovox's Posse Trak.
 <BR><BR>Aside from the time, money and research required to enter the navigation playing field, there is another stumbling block, even for the companies already in the market.
 <BR><BR>One of the biggest drawbacks, claimed vendors, is the gap with map availability. Some regions have them; others don't. The software, vendors noted, is the brain of the system.
 <BR><BR>Alpine, which is working with Navigational Technologies for its mapping, offered maps for California only during 1996. This year, Alpine executives said they expect to have maps for the entire East Coast and the Michigan/Detroit areas.
 <BR><BR>"Part of the difficulty in mapping parts of the country are each region's own needs," said Kutsuzawa.
 <BR><BR>Mapping is not only a technology that needs to be tailored to specific areas, but also needs to be updated periodically as roads undergo changes and construction. NavTech, for example, updates its maps every three months. Kutsuzawa said Alpine will upgrade maps on a yearly basis which would be available for purchase at retail prices ranging from $75 to $100.
<BR><BR> While price points should come down as more companies participate, Kutsuzawa isn't expecting a proliferation of vendors in the market this year."By 1998 we expect there will be more companies on board," he said.
<BR><BR>Rockford Fosgate is one vendor considering the navigation market. The company, according to Chris Parvin, marketing director, had a strategic move last year with its CD player introduction. 
<BR><BR> Looking ahead, Parvin continued, car audio vendors will be searching for new profit centers and breakthrough technology like navigation.
 <BR><BR>"For aftermarket automotive we are in kind of a lurch right now," Parvin said. "Navigation is trying to be that breakthrough product. Remember when CDs came out they didn't originally come out for the car    they came out at $1,800 for the home. Everybody laughed and said, `You'll never get this in the car.' Then, finally, it came down in price but the first car units were still $800. Navigation will come down. It's just a matter of whether everyone in the world is going to need it. Companies doing navigation now are counting on the fact that consumers will hopefully realize they can't live without it." 
 <BR><BR>One thing holding Rockford Fosgate back from entering navigation right now is the retail mindset. "We've looked at it, but we're not sure the independents are ready for it yet. We're probably a year from even being able to say it's coming," he said.
 <BR><BR>"There are two issues before the market expands," related Weir. "First is the cost. This is different from the CD player. Navigation is comprised of a number of differnt technologies which will all have to be lower at the same time for the cost of the system to come down," he said. <BR><BR>"The second factor is appeal to the consumer. Navigation appeals to a number of consumers, but not to the broad market."
 <BR><BR>Presently, the product is ideal for a number of consumers including salespeople, RV owners or heavy travelers. According to Alpine's research, the female of the household seemed especially primed for the product.
 <BR><BR>Still, the next step is really on the retail front line. Dealers, said vendors, will be the essential link to the customer, so first the retailers have to demonstrate an interest and commitment to this technology.
 That commitment will need to be in principle as well as pocketbook.
<BR><BR> "The inventory investment for this product is high," granted Kutsuzawa. "Especially since retailers aren't even sure yet if they can sell it. And while we need to motivate retailers, one manufacturer alone will not be able to convince dealers that this is viable," Kutsuzawa said. 
 <BR><BR>Vendors, however, are getting an assist with exposure from more car makers featuring OEM navigation systems and from the rental car market.
<BR><BR> Ultimately, consumers are looking for more than a gadget to prevent them from getting lost or a device that will list the closest restaurants. 
 <BR><BR>"A wide chunk of the population is looking for information and that is what navigation is," Weir explained. "To create a broader appeal this product must be presented as more than a navigation tool."
<BR><BR>"Plenty of consumers want an aid to their destination," Weir continued. "But more than knowing the way, consumers want information   reports about traffic, accidents, delays and the weather   along the way."
 <BR><BR>The opportunity for mobile electronics, Weir asserted, is to focus on the unstructured time consumers have in their car. "The car fitting into the home/office arena is completely cut off--we need to bring the car back into that mix," he said. "And from navigation, you will see a migration of PC-type appliations into car like E-mail, stock quotes and more. Navigation in this regard is an input like a cellular phone. It will increase safety, knowledge and productivity. This is where you'll see a convergence of technologies: the car is the next area for that."
