As 56K Modems Bows, Standard Battle Builds
</b></font></center><br>



With the first 56 Kbps modems expected to make their debut this quarter, the proponents of the two primary, non-compatible 56K modem technologies are working to build momentum behind their respective approaches, hoping that the marketplace will adopt a de facto standard in advance of one being established by an international sanctioning body.
<BR><BR>Essentially, the contest for de facto 56K standardization has become a two-horse race, pitting branded modem market leader U.S. Robotics (USR) against a joint effort led by chipmakers Rockwell and Lucent Technologies. Both sides recently signed an agreement making their respective K56Plus and V.flex 2 56 Kbps technologies interoperable. The protocol is compromisingly being called K56flex.
<BR><BR>For retailers who will be selling the modems prior standardization, however, the situation carries the potential for confusion among consumers, who will need to be educated not only about the technology, but about whether or not products purchased this quarter can be upgraded to meet whatever standard is adopted.
<BR><BR>Each of the camps is building alliances and gathering support behind their respective approaches. Among the K56flex supporters are 18 vendors, including personal computer manufacturers such as AST, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba, and remote access server vendors including 3Com, Ascend Communications, Cisco, Digital Equipment Corp., Hayes and Microcom, among others.
<BR><BR>The new modem technology is also being supported by Online Service Providers (OSPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as CompuServe, Netcom On-Line Communications, PSINet and UUNet Technologies. Lucent says the newest group of companies joins more than 270 other ISPs that have previously announced support for K56Plus.
<BR><BR>USR's technology, called x2, is being supported by Texas Instruments which will manufacture the chipsets Dell Computer, Hitachi PC, IBM Global Networks, America Online, CompuServe, MCI and Netcom, among others. USR says more than 30 service providers have agreed to participate in field trials.
<BR><BR>Both x2 and K56flex operate at different speeds in upstream and downstream modes. While x2 operates at 56K in the downstream mode, upstream transmissions are limited to the highest available conventional speeds, either 28.8 or 33.6 Kbps.
<BR><BR>Lucent, however, claims a technological advantage in that its technology will allow for 40K speed in the upstream mode, which will be beneficial for applications such as Internet telephony and video conferencing, according to Bob Rango, general manager for modems and multimedia.
<BR><BR>For retailers, however, the real key to selling the new modems may be the ability for them to be upgraded to whatever standard is eventually established.
<BR><BR>USR says that all its 33.6 Sportster modems sold after August 15 are capable of being upgraded to x2 technology, either through a ROM swap or via a software download, depending on when the modem was purchased. Lucent claims all its chipsets are RAM upgradeable, so it is anticipating that modems using its chips can be upgraded using software patches exclusively.
<BR><BR>Motorola, which is tacitly if not officially supporting the Rockwell/Lucent technology, is actively promoting upgradeability with a program called Tidal Wave, which guarantees purchasers of its 28.8 and 33.6 modems that the products can be upgraded to 56K when a standard is established.
<BR><BR>"We are guaranteeing a migration path for our customers," says Randy Smith, channel marketing director for Motorola's transmission products division. Depending on the platform, the upgrade could involve either a ROM exchange or a simple software dowload. Motorola hasn't yet determined a cost structure for the upgrade program.
<BR><BR>Motorola's Smith warns, "There is the potential for some confusion, and we are trying to divert that with our Tidal Wave program." Smith as well as Lucent's Rango believes it is incumbent on the modem suppliers to educate dealers as well as consumers about 56K technology and possible upgrade paths.
<BR><BR>Both vendors and retailers are hoping that 56K speeds will help beef up margins in a category that has seen significant erosion during the past 12 months. "It is our hope that 56K technology will help reset margins if pricing remains rational for everyone," Smith explains. "Pricing and positioning will begin to be played out over the next 90 days."
<BR><BR>Several 56K-based announcements are expected to be made during the week of CES, though companies are keeping details close to the vest until the deals are actually signed. It is expected that the Lucent/Rockwell team will make a number of new OEM announcements, and several PC makers will unveil products that will feature 56K chipsets from both camps.
<BR><BR>Few companies are expecting that an international standard will be established before the end of the year. There is currently an effort being undertaken to establish a U.S. standard in advance of an international one promoted by ITU, an undertaking that is being met with mixed reactions.
