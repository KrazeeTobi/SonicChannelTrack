Esselte Moves Into U.S. Computer Market

</b></font></center><br>

Esselte, the Swedish supplier of office products, has moved into the 
U.S. computer accessories market with a series of acquisitions, including the purchase of Curtis Computer Products.
<BR><BR>

In addition to the acquisition of Curtis, Esselte this year purchased 
Ring King Visibles and Anthes Universal, two producers of ergonomic PC  
accessories.
<BR><BR>
The acquisitions make Esselte a $50 million player here, and the Swedish  
company is still shopping, says Bob Scribner, president and chief  
executive officer of Esselte Americas.
<BR><BR>
"This is part of a multi-acquisition strategy for us," Scribner says.  
"It gives us a pretty broad-based position in the computer accessories  
market, and we're still pursuing other acquisitions."
<BR><BR>
The purchase of Muscatine, Iowa-based Curtis from Rolodex gives Esselte  
a broad accessories line and a marketable brand name, Scribner says.  
Esselte's computer accessories business will operate under the Curtis  
name. The Ring King and Anthes lines have been combined under the Curtis  
brand.
<BR><BR>
Curtis markets a broad line of computer accessories, including carrying  
cases, surge protectors and media storage. Anthes produces mouse pads,  
wrist rests, while Ring King makes other ergonomic products, including  
keyboard drawers.
<BR><BR>
Esselte, with worldwide sales of $1.8 billion, sells hardcopy office  
products, including paper and printing supplies, in Europe. In the  
United States, the company markets filing accessories under the  
Pendaflex and Oxford brands in the United States. When Esselte looked  
for ways to expand its U.S. presence, computer accessories seemed a good  
fit, according to Scribner.
<BR><BR>
"We decided to balance our portfolio of products around the world, and  
it made sense to buy some computer accessories business in the United  
States, instead of trying to go up against HP and Canon in the hardcopy  
business here," he says.
<BR><BR>
As Esselte looks for additional acquisitions, the company will focus on  
expanding into other product categories, including media storage, cables  
and connectors and cleaning products, Scribner says.
