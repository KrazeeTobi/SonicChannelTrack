Smart Phones Line Up At CES<BR>
Starting Gate For Web Battle

</b></font></center><br>



Smart phones are lining up at the starting gate ready to join the web-access battle of 1997 and a number of these new models are on view at WCES. Suppliers such as Cidco, InteliData, Nortel, Philips Home Services, Panasonic and Uniden were among those planning to exhibit them at the show.
<BR><BR>The lastest technology involves incorporating software from an ISP (independent service provider) to access the web via a feature phone with a screen and keyboard. The current line-up includes InteliData's ADSI-based model which is already shipping and a variety of recently announced models that access the web via different ISPs.
<BR><BR>InteliData's (the new company that emerged as a result of the recent merger between US Order and CDT) Intelifone is shipping at a retail price of $299 It is an ADSI-based phone offering a long list of telephone feaatures as well as organizer features, access to advanced calling functions such as Caller ID with call waiting, interactive services such as e-mail on the Internet, and information services such as sports scores, stock quotes, weather and horoscopes.
<BR><BR>The organizer holds up to 500 entries that can be integrated with Caller ID call logs and a calendar function. 
<BR><BR>The Intellifone has a four-line x 30 character screen, a fold down QWERTY keyboard, and a magnetic card reader.
<BR><BR>Although it is not officially launching its product at WCES, Nortel, a leader in the screen phone ADSI-phone business, is also planning to update its line to include access to the Internet by incorporating Java technology into a product based on its Power Touch screen phone. 
<BR><BR>Pricing has not been set yet on the new phone which is expected to ship in August.
<BR><BR>Nortel's advanced terminals director Patti Jacobs points out that the company already has over 500,000 screen based phones in place now.
<BR><BR>Another ADSI-based smart phone that is already on the market is the P-100 from Philips Home Services. It is a higher-end product with a larger screen that is expected to retail for about $350 in 1997. Also in 1997, it will incorporate a web browser, says company spokesman Paul Chappel.
<BR><BR>Philips is also unveiling its first new model since the P-100 was introduced in 1992. The P-200 offers more features and a new design, as well as access to the web, says Chappel, adding that it will maintain the same $350 price point.
<BR><BR>He points out that there are currently over 100,000 P-100 units in use now and these can all be upgraded to offer the web browser.
<BR><BR>Cidco of Morgan Hills, Calif. is differentiating itself by offering an Internet phone with provides full Inernet access (not just text as in most models) on a 7.4-inch touchscreen. Graphics are displayed in a 16-shade grayscale and the integrated browser technology is from InfoGear of Redwood City, Calif.
<BR><BR>The iPhone is expected to ship in the first half at a suggested retail price of under $500, according to Cidco president Bob Diamond.
<BR><BR>Uniden's new Internet Division is taking the telephone Internet access idea into the cordless arena with its $399 unit that incorporates a 900MHz phone. The Axis, as it is called, will also be available in corded version at $299.
<BR><BR>Both Axis models will come preconfigured with CompuServe Network Services (CNS) to offer e-mail at $4.95 a month, Greg Jones, VP/general manager of Uniden's Internet Division, points out. They are also compatible with all major Internet and online service providers. Shipping is set for this month.
