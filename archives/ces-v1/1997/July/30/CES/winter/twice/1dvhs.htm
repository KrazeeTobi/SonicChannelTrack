VCR suppliers including Hitachi,<br>JVC and Thomson are hoping to introduce<br>D-VHS VCRs sometime in 1997.

Although at press time, the lack of copyright and digital interface agreements threatened to turn the delivery of D-VHS VCRs into the 1997's vaporware story, several manufacturers were preparing to bring prototype D-VHS decks to Winter CES with plans for full-scale rollouts in the second half, at the latest.
<br><BR>D-VHS, which stands for Data (not digital) VHS, is the newest advancement to spring from JVC's popular VHS video cassette recording system. Decks will not only play and record programming using existing VHS (and in some cases S-VHS tapes), they will use standard S-VHS tape to record digital bitstream information delivered from and played back through direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems equipped with digital connectors.
<br><BR>Pricing has not been determined, although Hitachi and Thomson are targeting around $600. JVC said they believe D-VHS decks will be significantly higher.
<br><BR>Thus far, none of the more than 3 million DBS satellite systems in the U.S. offer such connections, although several DSS manufacturers were planning to include such interfaces in next-generation equipment. But, manufacturers said, agreements have still not been resolved on which digital interface should be used.
<br><BR>Randy Staggs, Thomson VCR product management manager, said Thomson's plans for a D-VHS VCR are still solidifying, but the number one application "will be targeted at DSS recording."
<br><BR>Thomson has yet to determine which digital interface it will use in future DSS products to provide the bitstream signal for D-VHS decks, Staggs said.
<br><BR>Jerry Barbera, JVC U.S. consumer video division merchandising manager, said his company also sees DBS recording as the primary incentive and JVC is seriously considering the use of the IEEE 1394 "fire wire" interface to deliver the bitstream signal. 
<br><BR>Fire wire offers a broadband delivery path perfectly suited to the full-motion video and sound of AlphaStar, DSS, Dish Network, EchoStar and Primestar transmissions. None of those have such an interface today.
<br><BR>However, some industry observers said that haggling over the interface for the forthcoming Advanced Television Standard Committee (ATSC) TV standard could threaten the launch of related technologies that may be forward compatible with digital bitstreams. D-VHS VCRs represent one such category.
<br><BR>"A number of parties have digital interface proposals on the board," said one observer. "There is a lot riding on the system that is eventually selected."
<br><BR>In the meantime, manufacturers are champing at the bit to get their products to market. Although the ability to record pure digital pictures and sound is the most immediate benefit of such products, manufacturers said they believe the biggest asset lies in the 44.4 gigabytes of digital storage capacity the decks will derive from common, low-cost S-VHS tape.
<br><BR>Several potential D-VHS vendors said they were working on exact feature sets and capabilities in the weeks leading up to the show and were intending the decks be used for both recording and playback of analog and bitstream programming.
<br><BR>Manufacturers, however, were playing their cards close to the vest and would not reveal the full scope of features and benefits that will be available to end users in first-generation products.
<br><BR>One possibility is for the recording and playback of programming delivered by a new burst-transmission system. Although no manufacturer has yet committed to using such a technology in their products, burst transmission of video and sound for a near video on demand programming service is being readied by EMC3 - which planned to debut its electronic data delivery (EDD) service at this weeks CES.
<br><BR>According to EMC3, 14 vendors have signed "letters of intent" to license the service, and D-VHS VCRs are expected to be among the first products to incorporate EDD receiving circuitry.
<br><BR>Because JVC holds patents on elements of the D-VHS technology as well as the VHS format, it would be the logical vendor to debut the system, EMC3 executives said. At press time, JVC had not acknowledged plans to implement the system.
<br><BR>EDD will enable users to order by phone movies, videos and music, which would be relayed to the end user over any one of a number of broadband delivery streams (satellite TV, broadband telephone lines, MMDS wireless cable or fiber-optic cable lines).
<br><BR>EMC3 said its EDD compression system will squeeze a 100-minute MPEG-2-compatible movie into a five-minute "burst" that is captured on a small length of conventional S-VHS video tape.
<br><BR>Upon playback the deck will slow down in order to view the program in real time. Pictures and sound are initially said to be comparable to S-VHS.
<br><BR>For now, JVC said it will display D-VHS equipment in its booth at WCES, while Thomson is expected to give sneak previews offsite to select dealers. Full feature benefits will be announced later.
<br><BR>Hitachi, one of the D-VHS technology's developers, was also said to be readying a D-VHS deck, but plans for the show were uncertain three weeks ago, according to Gary Bennett, Hitachi sales senior VP.
<br><BR>"Right now, we see the main benefit as recording programming from DSS," said Bennett. "We plan to have the DSS interface shipping in our products in April. We see it as a recording product to complement DVD, which does not record yet. We also see it lending new benefits for recording pay-per-view movies and events late at night."
<br><BR>Others were less bullish. Toshiba, which will be busy evangelizing DVD this year, has no current plan for the format. Claude Frank, Toshiba U.S. VCR product manager, said the format is too expensive and too dependent on other categories that have yet to appear on the market to warrant the production expense.
<br><BR>Additionally, some said that D-VHS will be rapidly threatened by technologies in development - such as recordable DVD.
<br><BR>Thomson's Staggs, however, said there will be room in the market for both systems: "I think D-VHS has a pretty substantial future, just due to the capacity of tape as compared to DVD. It will be a long time before DVD, and especially recordable DVD, will be able to match the kind of recording capacity you can get with a D-VHS cassette."
<br><BR>However, Staggs added, "It is conceivable that this technology will be used in the future for recording HDTV signals."
<br><BR>In the near term, D-VHS will be highly dependent on satellite technologies and digital modems.
<br><BR>JVC officials in Japan were contemplating the release of D-VHS decks as peripherals for personal computers that could serve as both data archives and storage sites for downloaded digital broadcasts, or as accessories for television sets that are equipped to receive digital signals. 
<br><BR>In a marketing twist, Japanese manufacturers said they felt the category would have the biggest initial impact in the U.S., where digital satellite broadcasts are now common, as opposed to Japan, which uses primarily analog satellite systems.
<br><BR>When digital satellite systems are more common in Japan, JVC said, D-VHS decks will be used largely for the rapid transferal of images and sound data to personal computers and digital audiovisual equipment, via broadband signal paths. This would include future DBS systems and possibly digital cable modems.
<br><BR>Digital satellite broadcasting systems communicate at speeds of 3-10 megabytes per second, far faster than that of integrated services digital network (ISDN) systems offered by local phone companies.
<br><BR>Recording data sent through DBS onto a hard disk of a PC is said to be more difficult, because the storage capacity of the hard disk fills up in a short time. But with the new VCRs, users can process a lot of data more smoothly by recording signals sent via satellite on a video cassette, JVC said.
<br><BR>In the near term, JVC's Barbera said, D-VHS will deliver the means of digitally taping DBS satellite programming bitstreams. However, the decks will not be equipped with bitstream decoders, and playback of bitstream material recorded by a D-VHS deck is dependent on feeding the signal back through the DBS receiver.
<br><BR>For that to be possible decks will depend on the delivery of a new generation of DBS receivers equipped with digital inputs and outputs that can interface with the D-VHS recorder.
<br><BR>Those who see the benefits of D-VHS players point to their capability to record 44 gigabytes worth of digital data, or enough to store as much as seven hours of digital video. At the same time, the decks will be backward compatible with existing VHS video tapes. Some step-up models may also be compatible with analog S-VHS video tapes, Barbera said.
<br><BR>Executives from JVC's parent company in Japan see the American and European markets offering the greatest potential for the format because digital satellite broadcasting is already far more developed in the U.S. than in Japan. 
<br><BR>While two consortia plan to offer digital television broadcasts in Japan within the next year or so, JVC officials worry that the service might not catch on quickly, since it will require consumers to buy expensive new satellite dishes that aren't compatible with Japan's most popular existing satellite broadcast system.
