Wall Street and retail analysts applauded Tandy's much-anticipated decision to sell off its 17-store Incredible Universe chain and close 19 unprofitable Computer City locations, two divisions that cost Tandy an estimated $150 million in losses last year.
<BR><BR>The closings bring into question the fate and future of John Roach, Tandy's chairman and CEO, who in 1992 opened the first Incredible Universe and declared it to be the retailing format of the future. Some analysts believe Roach will have to scramble to convince investors he is still in tune with the consumer electronics industry, while others said Roach will ultimately be praised for admitting Incredible Universe was a failure.
<BR><BR>"There's been speculation about Roach's future for years now, and this latest news will only add to it," said Dennis Telzro, an analyst with Principal Financial Services in Dallas, who follows Tandy. "He seems to be able to dodge disasters very well. With Incredible Universe, he cut his losses [and] you have to give him credit for that."
<BR><BR>Analysts are calling the ill-fated Incredible Universe saga the fastest and most expensive entry and exit in the history of consumer electronics retailing.
<BR><BR>Most say the chain died a young death for three critical reasons:
<ul>
<li> The failure to establish the gigastores as "destination locations" for consumers;
<li> Extremely high overhead and low foot traffic;
<li> And the general downturn in the industry, which unfortunately dovetailed exactly with Tandy's aggressive expansion plans to open eight Incredible Universe outlets in one year.
</ul>
Roach issued the following statement about the closings: "The Incredible Universe concept was developed to provide a larger selection, non-commissioned sales environment and a 'hands-on' experience. While individual stores enjoyed success and customers surveyed had strong positives for Incredible Universe, the economic model is not viable for Tandy."
<BR><BR>Tandy already took a $172 million charge for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1996 to cover the store closings, which in addition to the Incredible Universe chain also includes eight Computer City stores in California and five Computer City locations in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore corridor. The closings will effect some 5,125 employees in total, 4,000 of which were employed by Incredible Universe.
<BR><BR>Tandy is now is now in negotiations with five potential buyers for 11 of its Incredible Universe sites. The company already signed a preliminary agreement to sell six of the sites to Fry's Electronics, the family-run, closely-held retailer based in Palo Alto, Calif. The six sites to be sold to Fry's are in Arlington and Dallas, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon and Sacramento and San Diego, Calif.
<BR><BR>The decision to sell to Fry's had retail analysts buzzing last week, with some claiming the move turns Fry's into a major national player virtually overnight. Others wondered about the wisdom of Fry's, which already operates 10 computer/electronics stores in California, purchasing the massive locations, most of which struggled because they were unable to generate necessary foot traffic to cover their huge overhead. Financial terms of the sale, which will begin in February and be completed by June 30, were not disclosed.
<BR><BR>"Fry's must have gotten an incredible deal, because most people in the industry view Incredible Universe as a white elephant," said Peter Caruso, VP at Merrill Lynch.
<BR><BR>Telzro echoed the sentiment.
<BR><BR>"My guess is that [Fry's] got a very attractive price for the locations," Telzro said. "But I think it's going to be a real challenge for Fry's to succeed on a national basis. Here in the Dallas market, they're a non-entity."
<BR><BR>Fry's has a history of operating very large stores most of its California locations average in size between 125,000 and 150,000 square feet. The stores are typically lavishly decorated and are usually built around a theme, such as space aliens or Alice in Wonderland.
<BR><BR>According to the research firm Levin Consulting, Fry's sold roughly $400 million in total PC sales in 1995, including the highest proportion of peripherals of any retailer in the industry. The chain is known for its comprehensive computer inventory, which includes everything from components to boards to memory cards and software.
<BR><BR>Last year, Fry's dominated consumer PC sales in the Silicon Valley, thanks to its hugely-successful new San Jose, Calif. store. The retailer, founded by the Fry family in 1985, also operates five stores in the highly-competitve Los Angeles market. Its acquisition of Incredible Universe sites in the Dallas and Portland areas fits Fry's requirement that its stores be located in markets with large populations of computer and mobile professionals. Fry's declined an interview request about the pending purchase of the six Incredible Universe stores.
<BR><BR>Ironically, Tandy's closing of all seven Computer City locations in the Los Angeles area is expected to give a big sales boost to Fry's, which operates stores in Anaheim, Burbank, Fountain Valley, Manhattan Beach and Woodland Hills, Calif. The other Computer City stores slated to close, in addition to the seven Los Angeles locations, one store in San Jose, Calif. and five in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area are: one each in Houston, Boston, Cherry Hill, N.J., Charlotte, N.C., Cincinnati and King of Prussia, a suburb of Philadelphia. Two Computer City stores in Atlanta and Chicago will also be relocated. After the closings, Tandy will have a total of 89 Computer City stores in North America.
<BR><BR>Tandy said it has developed a strategic plan to reposition the remaining Computer City locations to focus on SOHO customers, experienced users and the corporate market. Computer City has steadily lost lucrative corporate customers to its key rival, CompUSA. Tandy spokesperson Tony Magoulas said liquidation of assets has already begun at many of the 19 Computer City locations set to close. Magoulas said the company will try to place many Computer City employees at existing Radio Shack stores or other Computer City locations.
<BR><BR>Tandy's latest store closings were part of a larger strategy to stem losses at unprofitable divisions and regain precious revenue. Overall, the company is expected to post about $6 billion in revenue for 1996, down some 30% from a year ago, according to retail analysts. Earlier this month, Tandy announced an additional estimated charge in the fourth quarter of 1996 in excess of $20 million after-tax to discontinue its McDuff stores. And, earlier this year, Tandy closed its two most unprofitable Incredible Universe locations, one in Woodbridge, Va. and one in Charlotte, N.C. The chain is now expected to refocus on its core operation, Radio Shack. Tandy has already announced plans to open a total of 100 new Radio Shack outlets in 1997.
<BR><BR>Wall Street rewarded Tandy for shrinking its Universe a day after the announcement of the closings was released, Tandy shares rose 75 cents to $46.25 on the New York Stock Exchange and continued to rise throughout last week.
