Mass Storage CDs Catch On<br>
Retail As Selection Grows

</b></font></center><br>



Mass-storage CD changers were finally catching on at retail during the fourth quarter, driven in part by growing selection, consumer familiarity, more visible retail advertising, and price points that fell as low as $249 on 100 and 110-disc models, dealers told the TWICE CES Daily.
<BR><BR> But many retailers attributed much of the category's sales velocity to Sony's launch of the industry's first 200-disc models retailing as low as $349.
<BR><BR> Megachanger growth is partially offsetting the downturn in the mature single-play and five- and six-disc changer market, dealers agreed.
<BR><BR> Highly visible advertisers such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and Dow Stereo & Video are helping stimulate demand by promoting megachangers in their advertising, their competitors said. But other factors are also contributing to the upswing, they added. One is the growing number of models with a disc identification feature, which simplifies searches for specific discs by displaying disc titles programmed into memory. A handful of models with keyboard inputs to simplify text entry has also helped increase sales, some dealers said.
<BR><BR> And next year, sales could accelerate further with the introduction of the first megachangers that read disc and song titles encoded on text-encoded CDs. Text-reading changers would make it unnecessary to manually program a disc's titles into memory. But the impact of the feature won't be felt until text-encoded CDs become widely available. Details of record-label plans were unavailable.
<BR><BR> Text CDs could also include artist name, lyrics and optional information such as fan club addresses, messages, and future and past releases.
<BR><BR> Although sales are up, dealers report that not all megchangers are sharing equally in growth. "Some are exceeding our expectations, and some are dogs," said the buyer for one regional electronics chain. Top sellers are Sony 200-disc models retailing at $349 and $449, and "what's driving 25-, 60-, and 100-disc models is aggressive pricing," the dealer said.
<BR><BR> The buyer for another chain, Atlanta's Hifi Buys, saw a similar split. "The inexpensive Pioneer 25 disc laid an egg, but Sony hit a home run with 200 discs at $349 and $449," said buyer Walter Liederman. For 100-disc models, however, "even $299 was disappointing," Liederman said. The reason might be that "if you're looking for an inexpensive changer, 100 is more discs than you have," he said. "People with money," on the other hand,  "might have more than 100 discs, and perhaps 200-disc changers caught their fancy," he continued.
<BR><BR> Until the introduction of Sony's 200-disc changers, he continued, "it was hard for people to understand the mass-storage concept. They said five was enough."
<BR><BR> HiFi Buys is selling "a good quantity of 200 disc changers," he added. The Technics 110+1 changer at $299 is a "great value," and we sell some," he noted.
<BR><BR> Hillsborough, N.C.-based Now! AudioVideo agreed that the hot models are Sony's 200-disc units. "Two-hundred disc is the first time we saw good sellthrough," said merchandise manager Kenny Thugut. "Maybe 100 didn't quite cover the collection, or maybe it was Sony's $349 price point."
<BR><BR> Whatever the reason, lower pricing on 100-disc models didn't help sell-though at NOW!, he said. "Kenwood went from $399 to $299 on its entry-level at the beginning of the year, but it didn't spike the business," Thugut said. 
<BR><BR> Sound Advice merchandising VP Tom Freeman also reported strong megachanger sales, attributing growth in part to lower pricing, but he quickly noted that "Sony is the strongest at 200 discs for $349."
<BR><BR> More affordable pricing on 100-disc models, he said, have nonetheless helped the 100-disc market. "About a year and a half ago, pricing went from $799 to affordable [for 100-disc models]," Freeman noted.
<BR><BR> Mega changers have also been popular with the Flordia stores of national chains. In late November, Freeman reported that a slugfest between Circuit City and Best Buy on Sony's entry-level 200-disc changer brought the unit's retail price down by 10% in two weeks. "Sometimes there's a giveaway at that price point, including a DiscMan," he said.
<BR><BR> In southern California, the two-store AudioVideo City operation attributed growth to lower price points, yet president Tan Duong noted that, "especially at the higher end," megachangers are "doing quite well." Consumers "who want a megachanger want a good one," he claimed.
<BR><BR> The company sells two of Sony's 200-disc models at $349 and $499 and was expected to get Sony's $600 and $900 models in mid-December. AudioVideo City is also "doing well" with 100-disc models, but 25- and 50-disc models "are not doing as well," Duong admitted.
<BR><BR> Besides price, growing familiarity with the category by salespeople and consumers are driving up sales, Duong contended. And features such as CustomFile, which identifies disc by title, are helping step up customers to $800 price points, whereas entry-level products usually let users identify discs only by music type, he noted.
<BR><BR> For its part, Dow Stereo & Video said it's "very pleased" with sales, which it described as "living up to expectations." For the fourth quarter, Dow promoted the products in print, radio and TV advertising as a way to archive discs to protect them from being damaged during handling, a spokesman said. "We've been focusing on it more because of the price points," he added.
