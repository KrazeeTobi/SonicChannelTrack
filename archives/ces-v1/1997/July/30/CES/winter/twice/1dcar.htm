Aftermarket Car Stereo Looks<br>
To 1997 As A Turnaround Year

</b></font></center><br>


The overdue wakeup call for the aftermarket car stereo industry sounded with the close of 1996 as the year wrapped up with flat sales, constricted growth and absence of any innovative technologies.
<BR><BR>"The shakeout that has been predicted for many years is actually coming to pass now both in retail and manufacturing," said Mike Silber, Infinity's marketing manager for car audio. "Not only is there consolidation among manufacturers, but retailers are polarizing   you have the big guys and the small guys."
<BR><BR>"A lot of manufacturers and retailers are running around panicking right now," surveyed Ray Windsor, VP of sales and marketing for Eclipse. "There are so many manufacturers who grew up during the real heady days of our industry which had a real long period of adolesence. But this business demands that we become adults now and some of us are having a difficult time with that."
<BR><BR>After a lukewarm 1995, vendors headed into last year with expectations for a recovery in sales, but those hopes were dashed as 1996 ended on a gloomy note. Even CEMA's revised 1996 figures projected a 2% slip in sales versus an earlier forecast of a 2% rise. At press time, several vendors expected as much as a 5% to 10% dive in sales in year-end figures.
<BR><BR>Sony's product planning manager, Mark Weir, said, "CD in-dash/CD changers are still growing categories and there are some signs of life in cassette, but make no mistake it's a challenging market."
<BR><BR>Unfortunately, 1997 doesn't hold tremendous promise either, according to sales projections of several leading vendors, who expect the year to be static at best. Estimates range from flat sales to slides anywhere from 2% to 10%.
<BR><BR>Several factors are contributing to the aftermarket car audio's woes. 
<BR><BR>An obvious hit to the industry is increasingly strong competition from other consumer electronics products.
<BR><BR>"This year the consumer didn't spend a lot of money in our part of the industry," granted Mike Gatto, car audio sales manager for Denon, adding that competition from PCs and home audio is increasing.
<BR><BR>But there is competition from a more threatening front. Taking a bigger bite out of the aftermarket opportunity is the sharp pace the OEM market has kept with car stereo technology.
<BR><BR>In 1995, for instance, there was heavy consumer demand for aftermarket CD because of low factory infiltration by automakers. But by 1996, automakers had tapped into this opportunity and, no doubt, will continue to do so. As more car makers offer CD as standard, the aftermarket opportunity continues to shrink.
<BR><BR>But other factors have contributed to the lackluster sales in car stereo like the absence of a "breakthrough" technology  and a growing leased car market which eliminates the consumer need for an investment system.
<BR><BR>While many vendors pointed out that an increasing leased car market can hurt aftermarket sales, it's also a chance for autosound vendors to better market their integration products which consumers can buy to temporarily upgrade current systems in their leased cars and then remove later.
<BR><BR>One vendor taking an aggressive approach with OEM integration products is Alpine, according to T.K. Kutzusawa, Senior VP sales and marketing."It gives a sale where there wouldn't have been one," he said. "The OEM link will be popular in 1997."
<BR><BR>While OEM integration products should thrive this year, car vendors will return to the well with what has driven business over the last few years: CD receivers and changers.
<BR><BR>While these products   CD receivers and changers   have been a strong growth area for car electronics with unit sales up, the average unit selling price has dipped. 
<BR><BR>"The market is getting fully developed," said Denon's Gatto, "so you have to expect that your sales are at some point going to be flat versus the year before."
<BR><BR>Price points, vendors agreed, will be a sensitive area this year with heavy competition for marketshare.
<BR><BR>Some vendors are looking ahead of the curve to a technology that is popular in Japan, but has yet to grab hold in the United States.
<BR><BR>"You may see more MiniDisc coming out this year," said Eric Kreis, marketing communications manager for Kenwood. "It's a better delivery medium than cassette and it's also recordable," he explained. "It's really a mobile audio system. We've had MiniDisc, but this year believe there will be more growth. We're playing follow the leader with this. We want to see how other people do with it because we want to be there too."
<BR><BR>While some vendors are looking for new pockets of the autosound market to exploit in '97, others are seeking to broaden their horizons beyone the core car stereo audience.
<BR><BR>Infinity, for instance, is releasing product at CES to attract consumers it traditionally hasn't enticed.
<BR><BR>"We have some products that venture into different categories   a way to deal with first-time buyers, female buyers," said Silber.
<BR><BR>"The core market is saturated," continued Silber. "Males 16 to 24 will continue to write the paychecks, but we need to get outside of that group. Also, 30% to 40% of all cars on the road right now are leased. These customers do not want to cut up their cars or make a major investment in these cars that they're going to lose. We're looking at ways of attracting those buyers. We have some things that we're working to bring out hopefully by January that will address that market."
<BR><BR>More mature customers, pointed out Alpine's Kutsuzawa, typically buy a car with a standard OEM system, but later on may want more tuning or control, not necessarily horsepower. "The goal for the future is to let these customers know there are products out there for their needs," he said.
<BR><BR>Not all vendors are convinved of how lucrative ancillary markets will be to the bottom line.
<BR><BR>"There is a look to some growth in that area, but this is predominantly an 18 to 24 male audience," Kenwood's Kreis noted. "That's the way it has always been and it will certainly continue to be the bulk of it."
<BR><BR>However, Kreis said that Kenwood planned to have products at many different price points at CES "to compete in all arenas." The vendor, which Kries said was not generally viewed as a high-end source, would be developing product for the performance buyer.
<BR><BR>While the manufacturing landscape becomes more competitive, so is the retailing world.
<BR><BR>According to some industry watchers, major chains like Best Buy and Circuit City are trying to compete more aggressively with the independent retailers. To do this they are beefing up areas where the big box stores have been traditionally weak: service and installation.
<BR><BR>For '97, predicted Chris Parvin, Rockford Fosgate's marketing director, "These retailers have stepped up and made drastic changes to their installation departments so they can make more of a push about being a top-line quality installation house. That's been something not that they have ignored, but it hasn't been their focus."
<BR><BR>The challenge for retailers, observed vendors, will come from differentiation in the form of competition success, special installations, beefed up customer service programs and exceptional guarantees.
