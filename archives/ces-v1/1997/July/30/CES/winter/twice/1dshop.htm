Retail Wish Lists Topped By<BR>
DVD, PCs & Digital Products

</b></font></center><br>

Retailers large and small have placed DVD technology at the very top of their shopping lists at this year's Winter Consumer Electronics Show. Despite the delays surrounding the release of DVD players, dealers are anxiously awaiting the new technology to help drive sales and create some much-needed excitement in the industry.
<BR><BR>Among the other items showgoers are looking at this year: direct broadcast satellite systems, digital video cameras, computers featuring Pentium Pro and MMX chips and flat screen plasma gas television sets. Below, dealers tell the TWICE CES Daily what they will be looking at during the show:

<B>CES Shopping List</B>: DVD, audio/video accessories, home theater components

<BR><BR>
We're obviously going to be looking at what's going on with DVD I think everyone in the industry is watching that technology very closely.
<BR><BR>We are also looking to audio and video accessories this year to help us increase profitability. We are going to be adding accessories, like Monster Cable, in a big way to help maximize sales of low-margin items. Whether it be cabinets to hold CDs or home theater furniture, we're going to take a serious look at accessories across the board.
<BR><BR>CES is really an excellent opportunity to see things up close and personal and really talk to the vendors. You get a lot of stuff in the mail, but you can't tell the quality of it. CES is the place to look and touch.
<BR><BR>We'll also be looking at the latest home theater packages and individual components like receivers and speakers. Home theater continues to perform well for us.
<BR><BR>I think DVD will help drive sales in 1997. People who buy it will hook it up to their five- or six-year old 19-inch TV and they'll want to upgrade to a large screen TV in no time.

<BR><BR>

<B>CES Shopping List</B>: DVD, DSS, PC-TVs

<Br><BR>
DSS is still very strong for us. We're seeing tremendous unit growth in DSS, but we're finding it more difficult to translate it into dollars. There's definitely been a surge since the $199 deal started it's also a product category that generates 96% customer satisfaction that's unbelievable.
<BR><BR>We'll look at PC/TVs, but as of now, we haven't committed to anybody. The price point is a little high. Computers should be a good category. I won't say [it is] a hot category, but we will be looking at new technologies, such as Web browsers, which we recently introduced.
<BR><BR>I think PCS will continue to grow we've got PCS in several markets right now, including Washington, D.C. and the Baltimore area. We think that product category is going to continue to be hot.
<BR><BR>We'll also check out the newest technology in camcorders, audio components and home theater components.


<BR><BR>Gary Thorne, president, Audio King, Minneapolis, Minn.

<B>CES Shopping List</B>: DVD, DSS, large-screen TVs

<BR><BR>
The number one thing on our shopping list will be DVD probably the same thing as every other retailer. I will assume some manufacturer will have a marketing strategy to accompany the new technology. I think the industry is ready for DVD we've been waiting a long time now.
<BR><BR>We don't go to the show to buy product we go to look at specific categories and to meet with our key vendors and listen to their marketing strategies and plans.
<BR><BR>We'll keep our eye on the new developments in home theater components and with DSS, both of which continue to be interesting categories for the consumer and important categories for us. Large-screen TVs really have been a success story for a lot of people. I suspect they will sell well through [the new] year.


<BR><BR>Eric Cherna, computer buyer, Brandsmart USA, Miami, Fla.

<B>CES Shopping List</B>: Pentium Pro computers, digital video cameras
<BR><BR>

I think this will be a particularly good show for computer technology. There's a lot of exciting things happening right now, between the MMX chip and the Pentium Pro computers.
<BR><BR>My job is to make money for the company with products that sell and offer good margins. That's tough in the computer business and [last] year [was] been no exception.
<BR><BR>I'm already placing orders for computers with the MMX chip. The Pentium Pro computers won't be out for six months or so they're saying April so there will probably be only prototypes at the show.
<BR><BR>There's no question in my mind that digital video cameras will be the hot computer accessory next year all the camera manufacturers are making them and I expect them to be out in full force at the show.


<BR><BR>Ed Maloney, co-owner, Cowboy Maloney's Electric City, Jackson, Miss.

<B>CES Shopping List</B>: DVD, computers, home theater components

<BR><BR>
I'm going to take a look at DVD. I think it's going to be hot because it's had such a big buildup. We've been told over and over again that 'It's just around the corner, it's just around the corner....' Well, that corner has finally arrived.
<BR><BR>I think DVD has the potential to be like DSS, which would be great. Anything new that can spur on or give a shot in the arm to the mature businesses, like TVs and audio, would be welcomed with open arms. We've got to find more ways to sell home theater and large screen TVs.
<BR><BR>We carry computers, so we're going to be looking at Pentium Pro and MMX computers. Basically, in that category you just hope to find anything with a profit in it it's brutal.
<BR><BR>We've got a home theater department and we'll be looking for anything that will differentiate us from our competitors, whether it be flat screen TVs or new audio components.
<BR><BR>

<B>CES Shopping List</B>: DVD, flat screen TVs, digital cameras, Dolby Digital audio components

<BR><BR>
Home theater is huge for us, so we're always looking at the new and noteworthy at CES. We're pretty happy with our speaker mix, so I don't think we'll be shopping for new speaker lines. We will be checking out the new large-screen TV models and the flat screen plasma gas TVs. We might carry flat screen TVs if the price comes down.
<BR><BR>There will be new Dolby Digital stuff at the show, and we're always interested in those. There will also probably be new DTS products, and I'll check those out.
<BR><BR>We already carry digital camcorders. I'll look at digital cameras and see if that's a viable category. Basically, anything that's digital related, like digital CD decks, will be hot this Christmas and next year.
<BR><BR>Obviously, everybody's waiting for DVD, which is being marketed like it's the savior of the industry. I'd like to see product and hear some marketing and merchandising plans. I think a lot of dealers attending the show want the same information about DVD.
