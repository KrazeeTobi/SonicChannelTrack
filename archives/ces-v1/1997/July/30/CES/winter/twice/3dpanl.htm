Panel Provides Expansion Tips For Independents

</b></font></center><br>


Store expansion can be a challenging venture, whether a retailer has two stores and is planning a third, or has 100 locations and expects to double that.<BR><BR>At a WCES seminar, NARDA executive director Elly Valas brought together two retailing pros from outside the consumer electronics industry to offer their perspectives on "How To Successfully Expand."<BR><BR>"It's difficult today to be cavalier about expanding a business," Valas said in kicking off the seminar. "Expansion has become much more of a science."<BR><BR>Dik Glass, a VP of the FAO Schwartz toy chain, related how his company grew from four stores in 1972 to its present 42-store count (with a few changes in ownership along the way). Glass said the decision to expand should be made strictly on the basis of sales. "You have to get to a specific level of sales before adding more stores makes sense," he told his audience, primarily other retailers.<BR><BR>Glass also said it was important to make sure you can afford to fully stock the expanded number of stores: "If you don't have the merchandise, people will walk away."<BR><BR>Tony Grappo, who helped launch the Outback Steakhouse restaurant chain, said it's important to research potential store locations carefully, looking for desirable demographics and the presence of other high-traffic businesses in the area. "And talk to potential customers to see what they need," Grappo added.<BR><BR>"You also need to look at how much business the new store will take away from your existing store," he said.
