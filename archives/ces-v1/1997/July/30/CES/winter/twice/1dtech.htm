Web Browsers, PC/TVs, DVD<BR>
Are Several CES Highlights

</b></font></center><br>


Winter CES attendees may have feelings of deja vu when they travel from booth to booth this year.
<BR><BR>That's because DVD is once again expected to be the highlighted new product category of the show. Now with a copyright agreement virtually established, last year's announcements will turn into this year's actual product roll outs during the next several weeks. Once again, look for Matsushita, Philips, Sony, Thomson, Toshiba and Zenith to show movie players and/or DVD-ROM drives.
<BR><BR>What is new for 1997 is that home theater vendors are joining the fray, including Denon, Harmon Kardon, Meridan and Yamaha which are each expected to have DVD players in the U.S. next year.
<BR><BR>Another hot trend will come from convergence products such as television Web browsing systems, full-blown PC/TVs, and D-VHS VCRs.
<BR><BR>Computer vendors, represented mainly at the Intel booth will show the latest addition to the Pentium processor, called the MMX which will rev up performance in gaming, audio and communications by up to 60%
<BR><BR>In audio, the industry will see lower cost Dolby Digital (AC3) receivers, and in car audio, new  smaller and faster CD changers.
<BR><BR>Here is a first peek at some of the latest technology at CES:
<BR><BR><b>Air Media Live:</b> The company will team up with Global Village to demonstrate the AirMedia Live Internet Broadcast Network, which can be received via Gobal Village's $149 NewsCatcher wireless receiver. Using the NewsCatcher, users can receive Internet information, including headline news, sports, stock quotes and e-mail notification when offline, since. Air Media uses a national paging network to transmit Internet data. Recently, Air Media signed a deal with CNN Interactive to create AirMedia's CNN Channel, a news and information program. The company also recently introduced a new feature called Cyberspace Doorbell, which lets Internet users "ring" another Air Media Live user's PC to let them know wirelessly they are wanted online. In addition, Air Media live has launched a licensing program to allow CE companies, PC suppliers and software publishers to build receivers and develop software compatible with the Air Media Live network.
<BR><BR><b>Alpine:</b> The company is spotlighting its four-model collection of in-dash CD changers which it claims have the fastest access times available. Leading off is the 3DE-7985 which changes CDs in as fast as nine seconds.  It began shipping late last year and has a retail price of $500. The flagship model, new for 1997 and retail priced at $1,000, is a dual-DIN sized unit offering a complete in-dash audio system package. In addition to the swift CD changer mechanism, the unit features a full-logic cassette deck, FM/AM tuner, subwoofer amplifier output and digital soundfield processor with surround, Listening Position Sensor (LPS).
<BR><BR><b>Altec Lansing:</b> The company is planning a WCES launch of wireless 900MHz and 2.4GHz computer and home audio speakers that it contends will rival the quality of wired speakers. The speakers using the wireless technology combine Motorola DSP processing with Altec's take on digital spread-spectrum transmission RF modulation algorithms and RF front end devices.
<BR><BR>Altec said its planning a range of multimedia and home theater speaker packages using digital spread-spectrum transmission technology and priced from about $500 to $2,300. The packages will include all speakers needed to reproduce surround sound. The final configuration and pricing of the speaker had not been determined at press time, but only the rear surround speakers will likely be wireless, a spokesman said.
<BR><BR><b>Arthur D. Little Enterprises:</b> will announce new vendor partnerships with VCR manufacturers planning to add the Commercial Advance system, and will premiere its new Movie Advance technology which will first appear in an RCA VCR from Thomson later this year. Similar in function to ADL's Commercial Advance system, Movie Advance automatically fast forwards a pre-recorded video cassestte past commercials and trailers on rented and purchased home videos before cuing up the featured program.
<BR><BR><b>Blaupunkt:</b> The company introduced a new line of car CD and cassette receivers offering Tuner Timer, a feature which allows users to program their car radios to tune to a designated station at a preset time. Tuner Timer autmatically switches to the preset station (for traffic or weather updates or favorite broadcasts) even while the user is listening to another station or when the radio is off. Tuner Timer is available on the Las Vegas CD receiver, The Denver CD receiver and the Aspen and Reno cassette receivers at respective suggested retail prices of $399, $349, $299 and $249.
<BR><BR><b>Casio:</b> The QV-300 digital camera will be on display, as well as a new photo printer and its handheld PC (HPC) called the Casseopeia.
