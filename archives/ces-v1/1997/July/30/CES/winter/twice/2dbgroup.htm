Role Of Retail Buying Groups<br>
Moves More Towards Training
</b></font></center><br>




These are not your father's buying groups.
<BR><BR>As the consumer electronics retail landscape has been transformed over the past 20 years  from a dispersed conglomeration of independents, department stores, regional powers, mass merchants and assorted other channels, into a more tightly concentrated group of national giants, larger mass merchants, independents and others.
<BR><BR>So, the mission, nature and role of buying groups have evolved.
<BR><BR>"Years ago, groups were primarily interested in getting better acquisition costs," says Mel Hunger, executive director of Key America, which numbers 18 member chapters and about 1,800 stores among its members. "We're still interested in that, but we're also training people how to manage inventory, get better ROI, help them with advertising, extended warranty  programs, etc."
<BR><BR>JVC's chief operating officer Harry Elias, noting the groups' array of services and competitive information, notes that "the business issue facing them is survival, not only beating up on the vendors."
<BR><BR>Bob Lawrence, executive director of Associated Volume Buyers (AVB), sounds a similar note. "Our focus is more on a merchandising standpoint. There's not necessarily less emphasis on the cost, because we still have to be competitive, but there's more emphasis on the merchandising end of the business," he says.
<BR><BR>Or, as Warren Mann, assistant to the executive director of NATM Buying Corp. says sardonically: "Cost is a component, but not the only component. If [all] you [do is] acquire it right, what can you do  make 10%?"
<BR><BR>At a time when vendors have been tightening their sales expense belts as a way of squeezing extra dollars out of their sales costs, the groups are presenting themselves as an efficient conduit to a broadly dispersed retail population. One retail executive grouses that a major consumer electronics supplier, "Cut out their group programs. They should have strengthened them."
<BR><BR>AVB's Lawrence says the groups can perform many of the services for their members that vendors are cutting out, at a relatively small cost.
<BR><BR>"Rather than just better price for performing the services, we can look at things like volume rebates, freight allowances, etc. We'll look at basically any opportunity," he says.
<BR><BR>He, like his opposite numbers at other groups, stresses the traditional benefits of groups, such as strong internal communications and the amount of buying power each represents. And those are legitimate strengths that many dealers needs in the current marketplace. "I don't see the groups going away. I see them as a necessary part for small independents," says JVC's Elias, who says that even the smallest independant "can survive with guidance."
<BR><BR>But Elias forecasts that the groups will go through many of the same twists and turns of consolidation as the big chains. "I do see groups merging and switching" among one another, citing Key Northwest's move to Nationwide as an example.
<BR><BR>Some of the shifts in buying groups will be driven by a search for more homogeneous membership rolls. Roger Heuberger, whose PRO Group members are chains that meet the same general profile in terms of size and merchandising philosophies and mix, says that the biggest dilemma facing some groups is "the disparity between larger members and smaller members."
<BR><BR>Several industry executives point to Nationwide as a group that especially has to deal with that issue, given how members such as Brands Mart and Campo Appliance dwarf that vast majority of other members.
<BR><BR>Like PRO, NATM touts the similarity of its members as a significant strength, both in dealing with vendors, and in serving its members. "The competitive landscape is very homogenous" compared with a decade ago, Mann points out.
<BR><BR>In the past, retailers in different regions were competing against a couple of national powers  generally Sears and Montgomery Ward  plus relatively homegrown competitors. Now, virtually everyone has the same principal competitors, no matter where they are, so "if one guy finds a good way to go to market" in a specific category against Circuit City, Sears or Best Buy," he can share it with fellow group members.
<BR><BR>In some cases, the common ground that links group members together is springing from within existing groups. In September, AVB announced the formation of a sub-group devoted to high-end audio/video specialty merchandising.
<BR><BR>Audio/Video Independant Dealers (AVID), says AVB's Lawrence, is comprised of about 100 "PARA-type [high-end] dealers who won't look at anything less than a 40-50% margin. We needed to isolate them [from the broader AVB membership of appliance/electronics dealers] to better meet their needs, and also to learn from them" techniques that could benefit the larger spectrum of AVB members.
<BR><BR>AVID is designed to attract smaller home theater specialists who would be too small to fit PRO's member profile, but who could benefit from belonging to a group with common interests and issues. Lawrence says that AVID has opened avenues for AVB to talk with "vendors who never would talk to us before. Vendors still see the opportunity with independents, especially on high-end products. They know they need to keep the independents in business."
<BR><BR>At the same time as AVB was rolling out AVID, a newly formed group was embarking on the same path of trying to bring together high-end A/V retailers. As of this fall, Home Theater Specialists of America this fall had signed on 22 members. Perhaps the most strident proponent of  homogenaity is Best Brands Plus, a group formed in early 1996, a furniture-dominated buying co-op with total sales of about $600 million in furniture, appliances and electronics.
<BR><BR>Under its Common Identity Program, members are offered a soup-to-nuts merchandising package that stretches from common signage, store design and slogan to advertising, marketing and promotional support. BBP, which is a member of Nationwide, feels that the industry has focused too much on price as the cause of independent retailers' woes.
<BR><BR>"It's not pricing that's taking dealers out of the business," says Pat Reed, BBP executive director. "If that was the case, then Luskin's would still be in business." His group's position, "is that the buying group was a great entity when it first came about," addressing the price issue through common buying. "But price is only a single component of competing."
