<p><B>&quot;Networks are slowly losing
their audiences as more channels are added to cable and satellite
services and we have to assume the current trends will continue.
 But to me, high-definition with sports and movies and major entertainment
is a way to arrest that decline&#133;. Only the major players
are going to do it.  And, it's going to help us; it gives us an advantage.</B>&quot;  <BR>
 - Michael H. Jordan, Chairman of Westinghouse Electric, parent company of CBS, as quoted in the New York Times</p>
<P>
<B>&quot;We are absolutely committed
to broadcasting HDTV.&quot;</b><BR>

Commerce Committee, September 17, 1997</p>
<P>
<B>&quot;LIN Television station's towers
have already been rebuilt or reinforced in anticipation of the
high definition transition.  Our transmission buildings have been
readied for the high definition transmitters, and we are planning
the first local transmission in Dallas/Fort Worth on March 31,
1998, for the opening game of the Texas Rangers.&quot; </b><BR>
 - Gary Chapman, President, LIN TV (owner of  network affiliated
TV stations), December 15, 1997</p>
<P>
<B>&quot;HDTV will be embraced by the
television industry because it is the way that we can compete
successfully in the new video marketplace.  Most importantly,
American viewers will be its greatest beneficiaries.&quot; </b><BR>
- Robert Dechard, A.H. Belo Corporation (owner of 16 network-affiliated
TV stations), testifying on behalf of the National Association
of Broadcasters before the Senate Commerce Committee, September
17, 1997</p>
<P>
<B>&quot;HDTV will enhance our viewers'
enjoyment of many of PBS's most popular programs&#133;. Imagine
exploring the majesty of the Grand Canyon in high resolution,
crystal clear pictures, displayed on wide screen format.  Or,
being able to listen to the on-stage musical performance of Les
Miserables in CD quality, surround sound.&quot; </b><BR>
- Excerpt from &quot;PBS and DTV,&quot; on PBS website</p>
<P>
<B>&quot;Customers have come to expect
us to be first when new technologies come along, and we think
high-definition is one of those things.&quot;</b><BR>
 - Jeff Bewkes, Chairman of HBO, in announcing plans to begin
HDTV programming in the Summer of 1998</FONT></B></p>

<FONT FACE="Times">Broadcasters are required by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to transition to digital in the top ten markets
(reaching 30% of US households) by May of 1999, and in the top
30 markets (reaching 50% of US households) by November 1999. 
 But, the industry has promised to have at least one digital station
in each of the top ten markets by November of 1998, and it is
likely that digital stations will be launched even earlier.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times">Network executives at ABC, NBC and CBS, and
many local broadcasters have committed to provide high-definition
programming when they launch the digital channels this year. 
Initial HDTV broadcasts on the networks will likely include prime-time
programming, and local broadcasts of sporting events in HDTV are
scheduled during the first quarter of 1998.   PBS and its member
stations are expected to make the switch to digital in 1998 with
a significant amount of HDTV programming.  In addition, cable
operators like HBO, Discovery Channel and Turner Broadcasting
have announced their commitment to provide HDTV programming in
1998, perhaps as early as this summer.  It is also likely that
HDTV programming will be provided by digital satellite systems
in 1998.</td></tr></table>
