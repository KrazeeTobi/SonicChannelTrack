    Coverage at the 1998 International CES - The Source for Consumer
    Technologies</FONT></CENTER></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff8000">The 1998 International CES was a major
    success as a national publicity platform for its exhibitors and
    speakers.</FONT> Over 2,700 members of the press / media attended
    from all over the world. Press media coverage included dozens
    of newspaper articles in the ten largest markets, coverage on
    28 national television programs, features in a dozen national
    news and business publications and extensive coverage by national
    and international news and services. In addition, there was substantial
    coverage in the national trade media, reports on local television
    stations across the nation, national radio features and over
    1,000 other newspaper articles. Exhibiting at CES has always
    been understood to be an effective way to reach over 90,000 buyers,
    retailers and others from around the world, and as the media
    analysis clearly shows, exhibiting at CES is also a way to reach
    literally millions of consumers. <BR>
<BR>
    <FONT COLOR="#ff8000">National television coverage:</FONT> Twenty-eight
    national television programs with a combined audience of more
    than 30 million viewers covered CES and its exhibitors. ABC and
    CBS covered the Show on news broadcasts as well as morning talk
    programs, NBC featured a long CES segment on the &quot;Today
    Show&quot;, and cable provided viewers with a cornucopia of coverage
    from an array of perspectives. &quot;CNN Headline News&quot;
    did over ten segments on CES. &quot;Money Line&quot; explored
    the financial side of the industry in three reports. And CNNfn's
    &quot;Digital Jam&quot; presented over ten features on the newest
    technologies on display in Las Vegas. MSNBC and CNBC also presented
    multiple reports from and about the Show. In addition, television
    news coverage positioned CES as a venue for important national
    and international news.</P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff8000">National print coverage:</FONT> CES
    catapulted exhibitors onto the pages of the nation's leading
    news and business magazines in a bonanza of positive coverage.
    <I>Time, Newsweek, U. S. News and World Report, Business Week,
    Fortune, and American Banker</I> were among the many national
    publications that brought their readers news from Las Vegas.<BR>
<BR>
    In addition to the national business magazines and newsweeklies,
    the national newspapers devoted significant editorial space to
    CES and its exhibitors. For example, <I>The Wall Street Journal,
    Christian Science Monitor, Barron's Investors Business Daily</I>
    and <I>USA Today</I> all published reports from CES. Investors
    Business Daily, in one of three articles from Las Vegas, offered
    readers an in-depth report on the expanded focus of CES. <I>The
    Christian Science Monitor</I> also published three CES reports
    which a include a feature profiling ten products exhibited at
    the Show, and USA Today devoted ten articles to CES, exhibitors
    and products.</P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff8000">Major market newspaper coverage:</FONT>
    Newspapers in the ten largest U. S. Markets published more than
    40 articles about CES. CES coverage in newspapers in the ten
    largest markets was substantial, and largely devoted to exhibitors
    and their products.</P>

    <P>Finally, the wires and national news services blanketed the
    nation's newspapers with features and news reports from CES.
    Although CES is a trade show, it undoubtedly reaches the consumer
    market!</P>
