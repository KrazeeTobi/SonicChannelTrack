<li><b>CT5: DVD ROM - Where's the Software?</b>

Most issues surrounding DVD are classic chickens and eggs: Consumers won't buy DVD players until there is a critical mass of DVD discs to play on them, and publishers -- particularly traditionally software vendors -- don't want to go to the expense of producing DVD disks until there's a critical mass of hardware in consumers' hands that can run them. Who's going to blink first?
Is a convergence of digital television and computing the catalyst
that will finally make DVD as common as VCR? When can retailers
expect to see software on DVD and what kind of software? Are consumers
holding out for writeable DVD that can totally replace the VCR,
or will copyright fears doom that technology as it did digital
audio tape recorders? The panel will trace the progress of DVD
in the market place and discuss issues such as the cost, payback,
and public perception of DVD.
