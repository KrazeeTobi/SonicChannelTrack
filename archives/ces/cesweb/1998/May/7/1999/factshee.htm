<p><b>Jim Minarik, president, Clarion Sales Corporation:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"CES has provided a fabulous forum to launch the Car PC, the first in-vehicle product to incorporate the Windows CE operating system.  There has been great attention, great attendance, and the press coverage has been huge.  Of course, it didn't hurt to have Bill Gates talk about the product.  The show is very important for our Latin American dealers as well."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Jim Palumbo, vice president of TV products, Sony Electronics, Inc.:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"A lot of people have been waiting to get into the booth...CES is a terrific vehicle for Sony to showcase its technology.  You've got the world's [electronics] industry in Las Vegas, and there's no better place to show it than CES."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Lisa Haley, vice president and general manager for new business, Philips Consumer Electronics:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"I think this show is different from some of the ones in the past.  We're seeing the start of the new technologies we've been hearing about for so long.  Everyone seems to be coming together in agreement.  It's a great place to showcase."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Victoria Durkin, director of marketing, MTX Paging Products:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"We couldn't be happier with CES, our first major showcase of the Beepwear watch.  There has been a lot of interest from buyers and the media, and a great number of inquiries from various international markets."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Steve Masters, program manager, Microsoft Corp.:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"The show has been a huge success for us in the past, and we've gotten a really great reception this year...Auto PC specifically has been very well received... We've seen really good interest from the OEM community, the press, and everybody who stopped by.  This is a much bigger presentation than we had last year, and we're continuing to learn a lot about the consumer marketplace."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Will West, president, PHAST:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"It's great!  It's our second CES, and we couldn't be more pleased.  We'll be doing CES every year - it's a great place not only for contacts but for all our dealers."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Nancy Fuller, senior program manager, Sun Microsystems, Inc.:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"At the very least it's been a very good show for us.  We had about 700 people a day coming through our booth...  It's been exhausting but good, and we already have a similar exhibit space set for next year."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Marv Tseu, executive vice president, worldwide sales and marketing, CIDCO Inc.:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"This was a terrific event for us.  We met with telecommunications leaders from around the world, and we've been delighted with the response to the iPhone, which we believe will reinvent telephony as we know it.  The international flavor of the CES was significant."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Dean Shulman, senior vice president, Brother International Corp.:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"CES is getting bigger and it is getting more exciting.  The number of visitors and exhibitors is getting bigger than ever.  This is absolutely one of the few times you can bring people into a fun city like Las Vegas, and though it's long days and long nights, it's the best opportunity you have to meet with new customers."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Dan McLeod, vice president, sales, Rockford Fosgate:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"I was extremely impressed with the show.  There was tremendous attendance, and our products and new booth were well received.  I believe that 1998 will be an up year for mobile electronics."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Victor Mims, manager, sales and product training, Samsung Telecommunications America:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"It was a great show for Samsung.  We showcased our new Windows CE-based smart phone technology and cordless phone products to a large number of mass retailers.  CES is of tremendous importance to our retail efforts."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Thomas Topalian, media relations manager, Lucent Technologies Microelectronics Group:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"Traffic was high through our booth at the Sands.  We conducted key meetings with OEMs and showcased our new DSP for video conferencing and our digital TV chip sets that allow broadcasters to transmit digital programming to TVs or PCs."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Tom Graham, director of marketing, Yamaha Corp.:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"We had a lot of traffic in the booth, and everything went very well.  We've already picked our booth space for next year and signed our contract.  CES is one of the few opportunities we have to show a lot of people at once what's new."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Mark Stein, director of marketing, Marantz America:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"We're very pleased.  In terms of traffic, CES has exceeded our expectations.  It's been a really good show."</FONT></p>
<p><b>Pat Roche, project specialist for new business, Lutron:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">"In terms of traffic and volume, things are going great.  We've gone through many more leads this year than last year."</FONT></p>
