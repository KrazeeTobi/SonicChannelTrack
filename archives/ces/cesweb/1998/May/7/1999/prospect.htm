    opportunity to reach all classes of potential customers, in both

    be an excellent way to present our products to a wide customer

    been waiting to get into the booth...CES is a terrific vehicle
    for Sony to showcase its technology. You've got the world's [electronics]
    industry in Las Vegas, and there's no better place to show it
    than CES.&quot;<BR>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffcc55" SIZE="-1">&quot;Though we attend dozens
    of trade shows every year, the Consumer Electronics Show is our
    most important--it's not only where our existing buyers meet
    to review plans and promotions for the next year, but it's also
    a major source for new business. We have taken advantage of some
    of the promotional opportunities which CEMA offers and we have
    always found them to be of tremendous benefit.&quot;<BR>

    in the booth, and everything went very well. We've already picked
    our booth space for next year and signed our contract. CES is
    one of the few opportunities we have to show a lot of people
    at once what's new.&quot;<BR>

    <P>Although they have always played an integral role in everyday
    life, never before have advances in consumer electronics products
    held such promise. Advances in the digital frontier have transformed
    the way we live, work, and play.</P>

    <P>The people who use these products face a future made better
    by these innovations. And the companies that put their products
    in the hands of these people will triumph in the year 2000 and
    beyond.</P>

    <P>Each year, for more than 30 years, our industry's premier
    event -- the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) --
    has made it possible for manufacturers and attendees from throughout
    the world to conduct billions of dollars in business.</P>

    1999 International CES showcases hundreds of cutting-edge consumer
    technologies.</FONT></B> They're the technologies consumers want.
    They're driving the products you're eager to promote. And the
    1999 International CES will help you realize the possibilities
    of this dynamic market in a way no other event can.</P>

    <P>As your marketing partner, CES offers the highest return on
    investment by bringing pre-qualified consumer electronics decision-makers
    directly to you. Our CES promotion strategy focuses on targeted
    direct mail, advertising, the CES Web site, and other innovative
    outreaches. Marketing activities occur year-round to hundreds
    of thousands of past and prospective attendees.</P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffcc55" SIZE="+1">CES is committed to making
    the show successful for you.</FONT></B> We advertise in a wide
    variety of targeted industry publications reaching domestic and
    international attendees. An advertising campaign valued at more
    than $1 million appears between July and December to coincide
    with direct mail outreaches and maximize industry exposure.</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="graphics/exhibit.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" hspace="4" 
    WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="189" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> CES reaches readers
    in the following publications: <I>Computer Reseller News; Computer
    Retailer Week; Dealerscope; H.A. Pro; Mobile Electronics Retailer;
    NARDA News; Red Herring; TWICE; Wideband;</I> and many more.</P>

    <P>Also, through www.cesweb.org, CES makes it easy for attendees
    to receive information through its Web site! By logging on, attendees
    can access facts on keynote speakers and conference sessions;
    browse through exhibitor listings; and, most importantly, pre-register.</P>

    <P>An exhibition is the only marketing vehicle that offers low-cost
    sales opportunities and delivers a pre-qualified buyer directly
    to you. The thousands of buyers depending on CES know that no
    other industry event covers the entire spectrum of consumer technology
    products like CES.</P>

    That's our mission. The show is sponsored, produced, and managed
    by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA),
    a sector of The EIA. As your association, we are proud to reinvest
    show proceeds into programs such as legislative representation,
    market research, and industry awareness campaigns. The consumer
    electronics industry has directly benefited from CEMA industry
    programs, especially our monitoring of international directives
    to enable US-made products to be sold globally and our ongoing
    market research studies to track market trends and consumer-buying
    behavior.</P>
