What is Convergence?</h3>Over the past 7-10 years, a lot has been written about the concept of &quot;convergence&quot;. A steady stream of &quot;convergence&quot; news reports, company announcements and analyst market projections raised expectations that a variety of multi-functional products would be available very soon. In particular, four discreet industries began defining and describing convergence in their own terms, and as it applied to their specific businesses:<UL><LI><b>Computers:</b><br>Software companies such as Lotus and Microsoft began introducing &quot;application suites&quot; that combined different stand-alone software programs to work seamlessly together. Both software and hardware companies began talking about the imminent arrival of &quot;computer telephony integration&quot; or CTI, where the lines between computers and telephones would disappear.<LI><b>Telecommunications and Wireless:</b><br>With the march towards telecommunications deregulation, long distance/local providers and telecommunications equipment suppliers also began planning for and introducing integrated products and services. The concept of &quot;one-stop-shopping&quot; was born, where telecommunications (wireline, wireless and satellite) and traditional data networking services would be bundled together for customers. The industry introduced new products that integrated cellular phones, pagers and voicemail. The advent of CTI enabled email and computer networking, once the sole domain of a corporation's closed business enterprise, to now be accessed over a single, hand-held device.<LI><b>Consumer Electronics:</b><br>The consumer electronics industry which historically has a proven track-record for developing multi-functional products introduced electronics product that integrated different audio and video technologies, e.g. a single device for television, radio and compact disks.<LI><b>Media/Content Producers:</b><br>Entertainment studios, broadcasters and the cable industry began discussing all-digital, fiber-optic and/or satellite networks that would offer 500+ channels of programming integrated with other services such as email and video telephones. The exploding growth of on-line services and the Internet spurred the development of entire legions of entertainment/business content developers, that began discussing new channels to deliver their content to consumers and businesses, all through a single integrated device/appliance. </ul><p>It is obvious that over the past four years, the pace of technological innovation has escalated dramatically thanks to the explosion of digital technologies. In the world of &quot;1's&quot; and &quot;0's&quot;, voice, video and data are indistinguishable, forming the basis for the argument that what was once just &quot;pie-in-the-sky&quot; convergence hype, is now coming to fruition through <U>real</U> technological <I>integration</I>. <p>It is obvious that the arrival of commercially available/retail convergence products and technologies has been driven by consumer needs. The dizzying variety of new consumer technologies, coupled with feelings of &quot;information overload&quot;, has consumers increasingly demanding products and services that are more functional, easier-to-use, standardized and integrated. Recent CEMA surveys show that 58% of today's consumers want to electronically connect products together in their homes, and that a stunning 81% would be willing to buy a new &quot;converged&quot; product if the different technologies were all available in one piece. <p>Finally, the following trends are also paving the road for demand in convergence products/services:<UL><LI>Diminishing boundaries between office and home.<LI>Growth of telecommuting (An 1997 IDC/LINK survey indicates that the number of telecommuters nationwide reached 7.6 million; half-million new telecommuters in just the past year)<LI>Dramatic growth in the small office/home office (SOHO) market (65% of telecommuters are employed by firms with fewer than 100 people) <LI>Growing numbers of employees who work from remote locations, and dramatically increasing numbers of business travelers</UL> <p>The Jetsons era has arrived early, and digital convergence is finally real.</p><h2>2.

How Can I Use Convergence Technologies?</h2>Most companies have a variety of convergence technologies already in use by their employees. Others are putting together aggressive plans for the implementation of programs which will put convergence products in employees hands. Here are several examples of ways in which companies are introducing convergence products to the workplace:<br> <h3>Commuters</h3><p> Each day, more than 120 million workers in the United States spend more than 25 minutes of each day getting to and from work, crawling along in gridlock or packed onto public transportation. How does one make better use of the 2 hours lost in commuting each week? Many commuters have started their work early and finish late, making use of their commuting time to make phone calls or draft e-mails to be sent later. How can your company benefit by adding 100 work hours each year-per employee?<ul><li>Laptop Computers<li>Cellular Phones<li>Pagers<li>Portable Fax Machines<li>Personal Digital Assistants</UL> <h3>Telecommuters</h3><p> This year, nearly 10 million American workers dialed into work from their homes, a figure which is expected to double by the year 2000. 65% of Fortune 1000 companies have already implemented programs which allowed employees to work at home, either on a semi-permanent or full-time basis. In order to effectively complete their work, companies had to provide their telecommuters with equipment that would turn their homes into home offices: <ul> <li>Laptop Computers <li>Cellular Phones <li>Pagers <li>Home Fax Machines <li>Personal Digital Assistants <li>Internet Box/Network Computers <li>Teleconferencing Equipment <li>Video Teleconferencing Equipment </UL> <h3>Mobile Operations</h3><p> Despite the fact that many of us are &quot;wired&quot; into the latest technologies, not all employers find their base of operations centered around one fixed location. In many cases, sales demands require that their people to travel on a consistent basis. Companies have been developing products for the off-site worker for some time, but technologies are now limitless. <ul> <li>Laptop Computers<li>Cellular Phones <li>Pagers <li>Portable Fax Machines <li>Portable Printers <li>Personal Digital Assistants </UL> <h3>In-House Conferencing Capabilities</h3><p>Remember when slide presentations and overhead projectors we the high-end limit of presentations? Today's multimedia computers used in combination with overhead projectors have made the jump to added sound and animated programs. Conference rooms are now equipped with state-of-the-art equipment which enhance the impact of any presentation. <ul> <li>Video Teleconferencing Equipment <li>Teleconferencing Equipment <li>Digital Video Disks <li>Multimedia Computers <li>Flat Screen Televisions <li>Web - TV </UL> <h2>4. What Products Do My Employees Need to Compete?</h2> <p>The convergence of Information Technology and Consumer Electronics offers companies a wide range of products to fit their diverse needs.  In most cases, Touch Technology offers products that are available today. No beta testing.  No bugs to fix.  Just straight Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products.  <ul><li>Convergence Products<li>Digital Television (DTV)<li>Digital Video Disk (DVD)<li>Digital Imaging<li>Digital Camcorders<li>Hand-held Computers<li>Home Automation Products<li>Internet Box/Network Computers<li>Laptops/Mobile Computers<li>Multimedia Products<li>PC Accessories<li>Personal Digital Assistants<li>Smart Phones<li>Teleconferencing Equipment<li>TV/PCs<li>Video Teleconferencing Products<li>Wireless Data Products</ul><p><a href="http://www.cemacity.org/ces/winter98/98wces.htm">1998 International CES Exhibitors</a> has more information on relevant exhibitors.<h2>5.
