    WOWS AUDIENCE AT<BR>
    1998 INTERNATIONAL CES</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

    <P>Speaking to a jammed-pack crowd live and at several remote
    satellite locations at the 1998 International CES, Microsoft
    Chairman and CEO delivered a visionary look at the future of
    the consumer electronics industry.  Offering CES his Executive
    Perspective Address, Gates' remarks focused on Microsoft's  Windows
    CE operating system, and the exploding number of consumer products
    this platform supports.<BR>
    	<BR CLEAR="ALL">&quot;The PC is not the only tool that consumers
    have,&quot; Gates said.  &quot;There are many products that consumers
    use in their everyday lives, from TV's to pagers, from cellular
    phones to new devices such as our just announced PC Companion
    products, including the Auto PC and Palm PC.&quot;  Gates also
    talked about Microsoft's partnership with manufacturers including
    Casio, Everex, LG Electronics, Palmax Technology, Philips, Samsung,
    and Uniden, and Clarion and Microsoft's strategic agreement with
    Motorola for wireless communications.<BR>
    	<BR CLEAR="ALL">Gates' presentation wowed attendees with a humorous
    and entertaining look at real-life applications of future technologies,
    including on-stage demonstrations of state-of- the-art technology
    and video clips of customer testimonials.<BR>
    	<BR CLEAR="ALL">At the conclusion of the Keynote Address, Bill
    Gates announced Microsoft's agreement with Tele-Communications,
    Inc.  (TCI) under which TCI will license a version of the Microsoft
    Windows CE operating system for digital set-top boxes.  Microsoft
    and TCI expect that Windows CE will be available for the advanced
    digital set-top devices that TCI will begin to deploy in late
    1998 or early 1999.<BR>
    	<BR CLEAR="ALL">In introducing Bill Gates, the Consumer Electronics
    Manufacturers Association (CEMA) president, Gary Shapiro, said,
    &quot;Our nation's continued world leadership, our phenomenal
    economic growth, and our rapid move to a computer literate society
    can be traced directly to the vision and genius of Bill Gates,
    the technological leadership of Microsoft partners like Andy
    Grove of Intel, and the creative efforts of hundreds of their
    hardware and software partners&#133; Microsoft competes ferociously,
    but it thrives on competition and it forces its competitors to
    invent, innovate and compete just as ferociously.  This competition
    moves our nation forward.&quot; </TD>
