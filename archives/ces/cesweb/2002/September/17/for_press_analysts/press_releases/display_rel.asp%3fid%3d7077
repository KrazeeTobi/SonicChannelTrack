<span class="subhead">International CES Highlights Digital Technology </span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/9/2001</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced that 122,422 industry professionals from 120 countries came to Las Vegas this week to see the cutting edge in digital technology at the 2001 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology.  The world's largest annual technology tradeshow, featuring 1.2 million net square feet of exhibit space, wrapped up today after four days of conference sessions, keynote speeches and exhibits of the latest developments in consumer electronics technology.<p>

"CES reflected the exciting pulse of the technology industry.  Manufacturers, retailers, content providers and creators, broadband developers, installers, engineers, corporate buyers, government leaders, financial analysts and the media all flocked to the show to experience and learn about the latest in workstyle and lifestyle technology," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, the sponsor, producer and manager of CES.  "This year's CES exceeded all of our expectations.  We set records for exhibit space and attendance in many categories, including a record number of high-level government officials.  Moreover, the move to a consolidated venue transformed CES into a four-day connected community."<p>

The 2001 attendance total slightly surpassed 2000's record of 122,244 and far exceeded CEA's initial projections of 110,000.  Independently audited attendance numbers from ABC Expomark for the 2001 International CES will be released later this spring.  Endorsed by the International Association of Exposition Management (IAEM), Expomark provides independent third-party audits and industry-developed standards for exhibition attendance, demographic claims and recordkeeping systems.  CES is the largest tradeshow audited by Expomark and normally is accurate within five percentage points of its post-show attendance estimates. <p>

The resounding theme of the 2001 International CES was the role of digital technology in consumer electronics.  Exhibitors showcased products as varied and disparate as high-definition televisions, wireless Web access devices and MP3-enabled wrist watches, all of which demonstrated the value that digital technology adds to traditional products and services.  The 2001 show also featured a wide array of new product and business partnership announcements, including the official unveiling of Microsoft's Xbox.<p>

"This year's CES showed attendees the power that digital technology can add to their lives," said Karen Chupka, CEA vice president of events and conferences.  "Digital technology is bringing us ever closer to the promise of a networked world - a world in which consumer electronics devices seamlessly connect and communicate with each other to make consumers' lives and work more enjoyable and less complicated."<p>

Off the exhibit floor, 110 conference sessions and four keynote speeches by industry giants echoed the digital theme, and educated attendees on new profit opportunities and business models.  Among the leading industry experts who presented at these sessions were:<p>

* Craig Barrett, president and CEO, Intel<br>
* Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect, Microsoft Corp.<br>
* Barry Schuler, president of interactive services, America Online Inc.<br>
* Kari-Pekka Wilska, president and CEO, Nokia Inc.<br>
* Carl Yankowski, CEO, Palm Inc.<br>
* Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT)<br>
* Congressman Bob Erlich (R-MD)<br>
* Senator Bill Frist (R-TN)<br>
* Herbie Hancock, Academy Award-winning jazz musician and five-time Grammy winner<br>
* Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA)<br>
* Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Susan Ness<br>
* Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Michael Powell<br>
* Congressman Bobby Rush (D-IL)<br>
* Congressman Adam Smith (D-WA)<br>
* Congressman Jerry Weller (R-IL)<p>

"The energy and momentum from this year's show will continue to build throughout the year and make the 2002 International CES even more exciting," said Chupka.  "With the new expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the 2002 CES will have room to host exhibitors all under one roof, making it easier for attendees to see the entire show.  Already, more than 1,040 companies have signed up for more than 1.1 million square feet of 2002 CES exhibit space during the past four days, an increase of 18 percent over exhibit space sold during the show days of the 2000 CES.  The show floor will once again be filled with the latest and most exciting technologies in consumer electronics."<p>

The 2002 International CES will be held Tuesday, January 8 through Friday, January 11, in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas Hilton, and Alexis Park Hotel.  For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.<p>

Add to that our celebrities at the show - our great lineup that leverages our whole NFL promotion - and it has been a positive experience for us and our customers."<p>

<b>Keith Nowak, Media Relations Manager, Corporate Communications, Nokia</b><br>
"This has been a good show experience. The media attention has been great. Traffic is good and we have had lots of good appointments. CES is the show where we launched our first consumer product that is not a phone, the Nokia Media Terminal. CES is a good venue for us."<p>

<b>John Garlette, Director, Strategic Events & Customer Service, Casio Inc.</b><br>
"It's been a real good show right through today. I thought 16 conference rooms would be enough and it wasn't. I had 12 product demonstrations in addition to the sales force and I even ended up doing product demos. It's really been a positive show. This is my 20th CES. CES sets the benchmark. Everyone else is scrambling to catch up. It has been a terrific lab."<p>

<b>Nicole Grani, Manager Worldwide Events, 3Com</b><br>
"CES was awesome as usual. We love the show. The show went great! This is our second year - we had excellent traffic and response from our customers."
