<span class="section_title">Panel of Leading Global Technology Policy Officials Discuss Broadband, Copyright and Other Key Issues at CES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Green Saturday at CES Addresses Environmental Awareness</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/11/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
Day three of the International CES, dubbed “Green Saturday,” featured a conference session focusing on recycling issues, as well as a forum with high-level technology ministers from the United States, Korea, Germany and Japan discussing issues pertinent to continued growth of the consumer technology industry. 
<p> 
In a session moderated by CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro, a panel of international dignitaries discussed technology policy issues on a global scale.  Phillip Bond, undersecretary of commerce for technology with the U.S. Dept. of Commerce; Dr. Daeje Chin, minister for information and communication with the Republic of Korea; Matthias Kurth, president of the Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Posts for Germany; and Tabata Masahiro, member of the House of Representatives for Japan touched on broadband deployment in each of the respective countries.
<p>
Tabata touted Japan as the most successful example in the world in regards to broadband household penetration.  He informed the crowd that Japan currently has 13.1 million broadband subscribers, calculating to 30 percent of all households.  Tabata attributed the success to policies enacted by Japanese government, including efforts by the ministry to enact the proper framework for resolving disputes.  Kurth said government should lead by increasing services that require broadband such as paying taxes online.  Bond reported the need for broadband penetration to continue to grow in American households and the need to lighten regulatory regime where necessary.  Bond also expressed the need for government to maximize incentives for investment.
<p>
Turning to digital television, all panelists listed deadlines for the transition from analog to digital broadcasting: Japan by 2011, Germany and Korea by 2010 and the U.S. by 2006.  Kurth cited the success of transitioning to all digital programming in Berlin this past August as a model for other markets in Germany and around the world.  He then called upon broadcasters to step forward to provide additional content.  Tabata proclaimed digital television as one of the hottest technologies in Japan.  He also listed two major opportunities for digital television broadcasting on a global scale that should not be overlooked – the World Cup in Germany and the upcoming Summer Olympics in Beijing.  
<p>
The second half of the session focused on intellectual property and future technology development.  Dr. Chin proclaimed the need for technology that allows for proper copyright protection.  Tabata expressed the need for proper legal framework needed to stave off infringements.  He reported Japan is taking a cautious approach.  All agreed that the issue of intellectual property is not a local problem but an international one and it is up to all countries to come together and develop a solution.  When asked what was needed to keep the industry on course and in the right direction for the future, all panelists agreed that regulation is about finding the right balance and international cooperation is essential.  Bond closed the session by saying “Technology innovation is a positive development as it brings the world together.  Networking people together will bring world peace and economic prosperity – something we would all like to see.”
<p>
The second annual Green Saturday at International CES delivered an action packed day of information and dialogue, starting off with the first-ever recycling event for consumers at CES, held in conjunction with Best Buy. The event, designed to encourage local Las Vegas residents to dispose of their old consumer electronics properly, was held at the Best Buy in Henderson, Nev.  The event attracted more than 200 carloads of recyclable materials.
<p>
The Success in Electronics Recycling conference session at CES focused on the end-of-life electronics recycling progress achieved by the consumer electronics industry and the challenges and issues that remain. Discussion revolved around various manufacturers' partnerships and recycling initiatives as well as ongoing efforts to establish a national solution that encompasses flexibility. 
<p>
Other Green Saturday initiatives included an awards presentation to honor the first-ever Innovations award winner for Environmental Design. Philips Consumer Electronics won the award for its 30PF9975 30-inch LCD FlatTV. In addition, an Energy Efficiency and Electronics Recycling Tech Zone in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center was an ongoing attraction throughout the show along with a host of other issues.
