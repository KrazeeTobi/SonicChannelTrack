<P><STRONG><A href="#" name=scene1></A>On-site Navigation</STRONG><BR>We’re making it even easier for International CES attendees to navigate the show floor. This year,&nbsp;a new on-site navigation system&nbsp;incorporates product category icons and colors.</P>
<P>The International CES addresses many vertical markets and can be viewed as having various shows-within-a-show. Eight icon images will represent the eight primary product categories at the International CES; look for them on the show floor&nbsp;as you walk the halls.&nbsp;In addition to helping attendees understand what products are where, the icons will be used in conjunction with a hall <A href="/print/docs/CESProductLocatorIcons.pdf" target=_blank>color-coding system (pdf)</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>For example, the Central Hall’s icons, video and audio, will be on a blue sign, and the carpet will be blue. The North Hall’s mobile icon will be on a green sign, and the carpet will be green. </P>These navigation tools will be used extensively in our pre-show promotion and on-site signage and materials, making it easier for attendees to reach their destinations.

<div class="section_title">Exhibitor Workshop: Preview of a Successful Show</div>
<span class="text">
CES extends enormous thanks to the more than 50 exhibitors who attended the third annual International CES Exhibitor Workshop on September 21 at the Las Vegas Convention Center. They’re now armed with essential exhibitor tools to enhance their CES experience.
<P>In an information download, International CES staff from sales, marketing, communications and operations presented detailed show information, including this year’s attendee marketing campaign, the ins-and-outs of booth set up and extensive PR/marketing tips. </P>
<P>Workshop attendees also learned exhibiting tips and best practices from representative of GES Exposition Services, Smart City and Las Vegas Convention Center Security. During lunch, exhibitor attendees participated in roundtable discussions on key topics and took advantage of one-on-one dialogues with official service suppliers at a Vendor Trade Fair.&nbsp; </P>
<P>One exhibitor described the vendor fair, especially helpful to first-time exhibitors, as a “living exhibitor manual.” </P>
<P>Exhibitors also posed questions to an expert exhibitor panel, to learn more about topics such as cost-cutting tips and drawing attendees to your booth. They finished the day with a tour of the Las Vegas Convention Center.</P>Did you miss the workshop but want more information?

    <p><strong>Load Up with Knowledge and Connections at the 2004 CEA Industry Forum</strong><br> by Dan Cole</p>
    Come in with your guns loaded.&nbsp;I love that expression, although I don’t know its origin and never really think of it in terms of a battle or a conflict. Rather, I think of it as the best possible way to approach any situation in life. And the 2005 International CES is no exception.
<P>As you gather your heavy artillery that helps you prep for the show, I want to give you what I believe is any consumer-tech executive’s best ammo: The <A href="http://www.ce.org/events/event_info/default.asp?eventID=IF04" target=_blank>2004 CEA Industry Forum</A> (FYI: Register by Oct. 8th to save $50 on conference registration.)</P>
<P>The information, contacts and overall experience you’ll garner October 18-20 in San Francisco is a bastion of high-tech knowledge on so many levels. So load up your chamber with these ‘bullets’ (Sorry, I couldn’t resist):</P>
<UL>
<LI>First, there’s the exclusive CEA market data released by economists about the upcoming 2004 holiday buying season and beyond. Make smart decisions about how to keep your company competitive in today’s challenging marketplace. </LI>
<LI>CEA’s division meetings that take place over the three days present an opportunity for your company to participate in shaping CEA’s public policy, technical standards, consumer outreach and research programs. </LI>
<LI>Network, and see, literally, hundreds of your industry peers—industry visionaries and retail executives alike. This non-competitive environment lets you get (and give) as much advice and information as you wish. Business and high-tech innovation almost always comes from mindshare, and I’ve seen so many brilliant seeds planted at this particular event. In addition to other attendees like you, you can collaborate and interact with sponsors such as <EM>ESPN HD</EM>, UPS, <EM>Partsearch Technologies </EM>and <EM>TWICE </EM>publications.Information-rich conferences get you up to speed with many of the markets within the consumer technology umbrella. You can get complete descriptions from the CEA website (<A href="http://www.CE.org" target=_blank>www.CE.org</A>), but let me fire off a few titles to give you an idea of the scope of this forum:<BR>- <EM>Connecting Products in the Digital Age<BR>- </EM><EM>Customer-Driven Innovation in the World of CE</EM> <BR>- <EM>Performance Homes: Consumer Electronics Drive Sales and Value while Enhancing ''Home Time''</EM> <BR>- <EM>Blue Laser Goes to Market<BR>- </EM><EM>Media Servers - What's Fact? What's Fiction?<BR>- </EM><EM>The Next Big Thing: Five Factors that will Affect the Coming of the ''Digital Home''<BR>- </EM><EM>Intellectual Property - Policy in the Making?<BR>- </EM><EM>The Road to Returns: An In-Depth Look at Consumer Behavior</EM> <BR>- <EM>Digital Cameras Get Competition</EM></LI></UL>
<P><A href="http://www.ce.org/events/event_info/default.asp?eventID=IF04" target=_blank>See all the details online</A>, and remember, you can save $50 on conference registration if you sign on by October 8. It’s among the smartest things you can do as you gear up—or get your guns loaded—for the 2005 International CES.<BR></P>
