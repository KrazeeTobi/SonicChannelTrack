Check out <EM>Behind the Scenes at CES </EM>for updates on the extra efforts the International CES makes to create a positive show experience for you. 
<P><STRONG><A href="http://www.cesweb.org/exhibitors/newsletter/oct2k4_pg1.asp#" name=scene1></A><A name=scene1></A>Transportation Update<BR></STRONG>The International CES is addressing your concerns about the volume of attendees at the upcoming show. </P>
<P>The International CES is an industry tradeshow and is not open to the general public. We pre-qualify attendees by means of a thorough registration process&nbsp; to manage attendance and ensure you get the right people to your exhibit. We anticipate no more than 120,000 attendees at the 2005 International CES. </P>
<P>We’ve also implemented new strategies to ease movement on-site and around Las Vegas. On-site, we’re using new icons, maps, signage and colored carpeting to assist attendees in navigating the show floor. </P>
<P>The International CES also works closely with the City of Las Vegas and local authorities to prepare for the additional traffic generated by the show. </P>
<P>Improvements already being implemented include:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="/print/docs/2k5_CES_ParkingLot.pdf" target=_blank>A satellite parking flyer (pdf)</A> was included in the attendee badge mailer and will be distributed at car rental counters at McCarran. </LI>
<LI>Coordinated efforts are underway with the Las Vegas Convention Center and Conference and Meeting Assistance Corp. (CMAC), our official ground transportation provider, to strategize traffic management on the show premises.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Increased traffic control personnel and Metro traffic police have been added. </LI>
<LI>Expanded complimentary hotel shuttle buses hours from 7:30 a.m.-7 p.m., Thursday through Saturday and 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Sunday, with limited midday service. </LI>
<LI>Added buses for increased attendance. </LI>
<LI>Expanded Alexis Park Express shuttle hours: 8 a.m.-6:30 p.m., Thursday through Saturday and 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m., Sunday, every 15 minutes. </LI>
<LI>Extended hours of operation for the outbound shuttle service to McCarran International airport on Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m.-7 p.m., for $5. </LI>
<LI>Additional security checkpoints are being added at McCarran International Airport. </LI>
<LI>CEA is now a TSA partner and regularly meets to discuss transportation at the show.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG><A name=scene2><STRONG></STRONG></A>New Navigation Codes</STRONG><BR>Last month we told you about the new on-site navigation icons for the 2005 International CES. Now we’re making the icons available to you!</P>
<P><A title="Exhibitor Downloads" href="/print/exhibitors/downloads/default.asp"><IMG src="/print/images/general/cesIcons.gif" border=0></A></P>

<P><STRONG><A name=scene3></A>Airport Update<BR></STRONG>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), producer of the International CES, has been in discussion with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) about ways to improve the movement of passengers through McCarran Airport during the 2005 International CES.</P>
<P>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) has partnered with TSA to introduce the nation's first airport-based <A title="Transportation Security Administration" href="http://129.33.119.130/public/display?theme=175" target=_blank>traveler education program</A>, "Traveler Information Prescreening Series" (TIPS). </P>
<P>This series of 11 video vignettes features Las Vegas luminaries demonstrating how to navigate a range of security checkpoint requirements, such as having proof of identity ready and which types of baggage must be checked.</P>
<P>The McCarran TIPS program will be shown on 25 computer-linked LCD monitors, installed throughout the airport. This state-of-the-art messaging system will also enable airport officials to communicate instantly and efficiently with passengers at a moment’s notice. McCarran is the first U.S. airport to employ this new technology.</P>
<P>Other changes to improve passenger navigation include the addition of seven new security checkpoint lanes leading to the C/D gates, in-line baggage check, “smart check” check-in passenger and baggage check kiosks, additional TSA screeners and personnel at McCarran during the 2005 International CES, and the translation of the “Ready for Take Off” literature into several different languages for international travelers. CEA has also extended the hours of the outbound airport shuttle to accommodate show attendees. In addition, an off-site luggage check-in with a secure radio frequency identification (RFID) tag tracking system is being considered for the future.</P><A href="/print/attendees/travel/default.asp">More travel details</A>.

<P>The <A href="/print/exhibitors/manual/utilities.asp#manual2040">Good Neighbor program</A> uses an air magnet system to make sure wireless products utilized in your booth will not conflict with your neighbors’ products. Coordinate your wireless use on the show floor, so that your wireless devices function well. </P>
<P>Coordinate in advance! The nature of different wireless spectrums may cause your product to interfere with a neighbor’s product. Let us help ensure that your presentation and demonstrations on the show floor are successful. Smart City does not allow exhibitors to supply their own wireless access points, except in special circumstances. The access points of wireless violators will be shut down.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you plan to utilize a convention center access point, it is <STRONG><EM>imperative </EM></STRONG>that you <A href="/print/docs/Smart_City_Wireless_Performance_Declaration_-_2005_International_CES.pdf" target=_blank>notify Smart City at least three weeks prior to the show (pdf)</A>. This will help to achieve optimum performance of your access point(s). Contact Smart City at (888) 446-6911, (702) 943-6000 or e-mail <A href="mailto:mdworin@smartcity.com">mdworin@smartcity.com</A>.</P>
<P>Contact Smart City at (702) 943-6080 or <A href="mailto:mdworin@smartcity.com">mdworin@smartcity.com</A> to enroll in the Good Neighbor program.

    <p><strong>The Sands of Time</strong><br> by Dan Cole</p>
    Every grain of sand contributes to the landscape of a beach. Each one, in some way, finds its place alongside another to add to the sprawling stretch. Each moves with the dynamic forces of the tide and other elements.
<P>Like a beach that changes over time, the consumer electronics industry is also a collection of individual pieces that are constantly shifting, evolving and coming together in new ways to create one dynamic scene.</P>
<P>As a direct reflection of the industry we represent, the International CES also adapts to the winds of change and embraces the new technologies that come into the consumer technology landscape.</P>
<P>We want the International CES to be a destination for everyone who is part of the global consumer electronics business community, and that’s why we’re excited to announce that we’ll be using the Sands Convention Center for the 2006 International CES to showcase emerging technologies, new and expanding exhibitors and special exhibits.</P>
<P>You’ll be hearing much more about the Sands effort in the year to come, but I wanted to be the first to tell you that the 2006 International CES is, like the industry at large, already offering exciting opportunities for us all.</P>
<P>The digital imaging and wireless markets are weaving into the mobile (in-car) electronics industry. Home entertainment now draws on wireless and computing technologies as frequently as it leans on the powers of audio and video. All the while, networking and embedded technologies blend into every niche mentioned above to create a new, exciting landscape for consumers.</P>
<P>With each passing minute, new technology emerges to answer the demands of consumers who are accustomed to being connected anywhere and any time. The International CES is dedicated to providing a place for this innovation to collect, converge and create a compelling, dynamic setting for you to strike deals, forge relationships and succeed.</P>
<P>When you make your way to the Exhibit Space Selection Room at the 2005 International CES this January, make sure to ask me or your business development contact about the <A href="/print/docs/SandsVenue.pdf" target=_blank>new Sands destination (pdf)</A>—and learn how you can contribute to our evolving, exciting consumer technology landscape.<BR></P>
