<span class="section_title">The Hottest Consumer Technology in the World to Be Showcased at 2003 International CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/7/2003</i></strong>
<br><br>
Attendees will get an exclusive view straight down the pipeline of what's hot in consumer technology at the 2003 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, January 9-12, 2003, in Las Vegas, Nev.  <p>

"Attendees will truly witness how products are working together to keep our world connected 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of the International CES.  "As products and technology continue to evolve and efficiency increases, the amazing advances made by CE products and technology is never more evident.  CES highlights these advances in a venue like no other with the largest display of consumer technology in the world."<p>

The 2003 International CES, the largest in show history, will showcase these advances in more than 1.2 million square feet of space by 2,000 international exhibitors.  A huge element of the 2003 show will focus on how wireless technology is allowing products to converge and perform multiple functions from one device.   Digital technologies such as Bluetooth, 802.11, USB, 1394, Ethernet and TCP/IP provide the conduit for convergence in consumer products, and these technologies help showcase the wireless industry to CES attendees.  With more than 20 technology pavilions, the largest in show history, wireless technology will be on display in such venues as the Ultimate Wireless SuperStore and the Bluetooth Pavilion.  In addition, exhibitors will showcase some of their newest and hottest products including Fossil's Wrist PDA, Samsung's Gadget Camcorder, Finger System's iPen Bluetooth and Timex's Bodylink System.<p>

With consumers spending more time in the home and in their cars, the 2003 International CES highlights the latest in digital audio, video and home entertainment technologies.  The nucleus of home networking and entertainment is coming of age with the use of digital servers serving as the mainframe for audio, video and communications demands throughout the home.  The realm of home entertainment will be represented with products such as high-definition television (HDTV), large plasma and LCD monitors, digital imaging, home video production, personal video recorders (PVR), multi-channel audio-visual systems and surround sound and MP3 audio.  <p>
