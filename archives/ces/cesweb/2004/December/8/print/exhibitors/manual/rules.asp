<br><br>
Most electronic equipment that uses radio frequency energy, must meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations limiting such emissions and must receive a grant of the appropriate equipment authorization from the FCC prior to being manufactured, imported or marketed. Equipment requiring such an authorization, which is displayed at the 2004 International CES, must either have already received the necessary FCC authorization or must be accompanied by the following notice conspicuously displayed: <BR><BR>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 width="90%" align=center 0?>

Failure to follow these guidelines, as well as other appropriate FCC rules, is a violation of federal law (47 U.S.C. Section 302(b)). It is anticipated that FCC investigators will attend the 2004 International CES looking for such violations. <BR><BR>For further information regarding the types of equipment that require FCC authorization, see the FCC Rules at 47CFR Section 2.803, or contact the FCC Laboratory headquarters at (301) 362-3000.

<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Exhibitors demonstrating audio equipment in an open display should use a sound chamber or acoustically contained area to keep the sound level from intruding on any adjacent exhibits. Loudspeakers of any kind must be directed toward the interior of the demonstrator's exhibit space. Speakers may not face aisles or other exhibitors' booths. </LI>
<LI>When demonstrating audio equipment within an enclosed demonstration room, position subwoofers away from walls that abut neighboring exhibitors.

<span class="subhead">Lighting Restrictions</span>
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Due to weight and power restrictions, truss lighting is limited in some exhibit areas. </LI>
<LI>Neon is acceptable so long as it is in accordance with local neon regulations. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Small flashing-chaser lights are permitted in a booth to a maximum height of 8'. </LI>
<LI>Strobe, rotating and garish neon lighting are not permitted. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Lighting should be directed to the inner confines of the booth space and not project onto other exhibits or show aisles. </LI></UL><STRONG><BR>Lights Out Policy<BR></STRONG>If you are interested in having facility lights turned off over your exhibit, please refer to the Lights Out Request included in the Show Utilities section of this exhibitor manual.&nbsp; All lights out requests are handled by TSE, but are contingent on apporval to ensure lighting adjustments will not adversely effect neighboring exhibits.<BR><BR><B>LVCC Halogen Lighting Policy</B> <BR>In a move to ensure the safety of building customers at the Las Vegas Convention Center, the building has placed a ban on certain halogen lamps. Halogen lamps are limited to 75 watts and must be of the sealed variety, which prevents direct handling of the bulb. The ban became effective January 1, 2003. <BR><BR><B>Why is the LVCC Restricting the Use of Halogen Lighting?</B> <BR>The LVCC has experienced several fire safety incidents arising from the use of stem mounted halogen light fixtures attached to exhibit booths that utilize linear quartz bulbs. Typically these hazards arise from misuse and poor maintenance practices, rather than from any deficiency in the design of the fixture or the halogen bulb it contains. <BR><BR>Misuse encountered by the LVCC has included failure to correctly install the fixtures in a secure fashion and failure to ensure that fixtures are not in close proximity to drapes, displayed items, or similar flammable material. <BR><BR>Poor maintenance includes replacing bulbs with higher wattages than the permitted maximum marked on the fixture, failure to replace lenses or shields after re-lamping, failure to follow manufacturers handling procedures, i.e., no direct bodily contact with bulbs or cleaning of bulb with a recommended agent if incidental contact has occurred, and replacement of broken lenses and other components with sub-standard, non- approved, parts. These practices are not within the ability of LVCC or the equipment manufacturer/distributor to supervise, and may result in safety risks. <BR><BR><B>What Halogen Lighting is Covered by this Policy? </B><BR>This policy covers only certain restrictions on stem mounted halogen lighting installed by display contractors and exhibitors for the temporary lighting of exhibit booths. Stem mounted fixtures employ an arm that extends outward from the mounting mechanism, and which is typically terminated in a light head that pivots, swivels, or is otherwise movable. The use of any stem mounted halogen or other fixtures employing either a linear quartz bulb or a non-shielded halogen bulb is not allowed. <BR><B><BR>What Halogen Lighting is NOT Covered by this Policy? </B><BR>Halogen bulbs, or lighting fixtures containing halogen bulbs, that are being displayed or demonstrated as part of an exhibiting company's product line or business in its booth, and any theater, stage, or studio lighting equipment utilizing halogen bulbs, are not covered by this policy. In addition, conventional track lighting systems that use any of the approved types of halogen bulbs and that are securely mounted to stable exhibit structures will continue to be allowed. <BR><BR><B>How Do the Restrictions Affect Stem Mounted Halogen Light Fixtures?</B> <BR>Unless otherwise stated in this policy, stem mounted halogen light fixtures installed in LVCC facilities must: 
<UL>
<LI>Utilize a halogen bulb that has an additional glass shield and requires no other shield as part of the light fixture. </LI>
<LI>Utilize a bulb not exceeding the listed wattage permitted for use by the fixture manufacturer, up to a maximum of 75 watts. </LI></UL><BR><B>Alternative Lighting Designs</B> <BR>The LVCC will periodically review this policy, and take into consideration any improvements in products and practices that provide appropriate levels of operational safety. <BR><BR><B>Important:</B> The use of the quartz halogen, stem-type, double ended bulbs are no longer permitted at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC). The facility will permit the round halogen, sealed, screw-in type bulbs that are 75 watts or less. <BR><BR>If you need further information, please contact the LVCC Office of Fire-Safety at (702) 892-7400.

<br><br>
The International CES will allow cameras on the show floor. However, media are required to obtain passes/stickers for their camera equipment.
