<span class="section_title">2005 International CES Expands Exhibits Into Central And South Plazas</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">CES Destination Features New Innovations Plus, HD Pro Showcase and Studio @ Home Exhibits</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;7/20/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
The International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is expanding technology showcases and interactive exhibits in the new Central and South Plazas for its 2005 show, which runs January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nev.
<p>
Located directly in front of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the CES Central and South Plazas house the Innovations Design and Engineering awards honorees, specialized TechZones and showcases, and 100 exhibitors such as Gibson Audio.
<p>
A dozen TechZones will feature in-depth and hands-on exhibits in digital imaging, MP3 and Internet audio, ultrawideband products and services, DSL, assistive devices, USB, portable power, electronic fitness, VOIP, RFID and other emerging technologies.
<p>
"The International CES continues to evolve and become a home for emerging consumer technologies," exclaimed Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences for the Consumer Electronics Association, the producer of the International CES.  "For 2005, we're creating a combined area that will highlight emerging technologies and hot new products as well as showcase digital imaging and production."
<p>
To help attendees navigate the Plazas easily, the exhibits are broken out into several distinct areas. On the CES Central Plaza, Innovations Plus features the award-winning Innovations honorees, PC Magazine's Fastest Geek Contest and the semi-finals of Last Gadget Standing, live radio broadcasts from Into Tomorrow with Dave Graveline, a gaming arcade and the largest congregation of specialized TechZones at CES. The product displays of Innovations honorees will be spread throughout Innovations Plus, in effect making Innovations part of nearly every area housed in the exhibit structure.  Innovations honorees will be grouped together by product category with signage exclusive to the honorees.
<p>
The CES Central Plaza also holds separate exhibits for Gibson Audio and Flash Forward: Bringing Digital Imaging into Focus. The CES South Plaza is home to CES' new Studio@Home and HD Pro Showcase as well as the NxtGen05 Demonstration Home produced by iShow. 
<p>
Produced in cooperation with CMPinformation, publisher of Pro Sound News, Videography, Digital TV, sports TV, Government Video, Guitar Player, EQ and Keyboard magazines, Studio@Home will include home recording and editing products, electronic music software, DJ, keyboards and virtual musical instruments as well as desktop video editing and production tools.  Incorporating a working home studio, Studio@Home will feature musical artists and major engineers/producers demonstrating advanced audio/video production tools. 
<p>
The new CES HD Pro Showcase will demonstrate the growing amount of programming, production and delivery systems that are already in place to support today's expanding consumer market for high definition televisions.  Also co-sponsored by CMPinformation, HD Pro Showcase will present attendees with demonstrations of high-definition cameras, storage, graphics and editing systems as well as new affordable portable HDV camcorders and desktop solutions.
<p>
A full line-up of CES exhibitors and sponsors is listed at www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information. General attendee registration as well as hotel and travel arrangements are now available at www.CESweb.org. In addition, international guests can obtain help in applying for travel visas via the website.
<p>
Note to Journalists:  	Detailed CES press conference information will be available later this year. Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 4, 2005 to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events.  CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES will run January 4 from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in the Las Vegas Convention Center, room S226, across the hallway from the CES Press Room.  A list of press room hours and services is posted at www.CESweb.org.
