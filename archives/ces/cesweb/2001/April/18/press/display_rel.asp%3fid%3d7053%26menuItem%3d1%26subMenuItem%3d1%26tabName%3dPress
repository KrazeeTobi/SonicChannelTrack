	<td><font class="pressReleaseBody">More than 1,800 companies will showcase the latest in consumer technology at the 2001 International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, January 6 - 9 in Las Vegas, Nev.  These exhibitors will represent more than 25 different technology segments including: digital audio and video, information technology (IT), home networking, emerging technologies, broadband, home theater, mobile electronics, personal electronics, content media, specialty audio, delivery systems, the Internet, telephony and wireless communications.<p>MORE ACCESSIBILITY<p>In an effort to make exhibit areas more convenient, the International CES made some changes this year to accommodate both attendees and exhibitors alike.  Almost all exhibitors will be located within walking distance to one another in the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Riviera Hotel.  Shuttle bus service to the specialty audio exhibits located in the Alexis Park Hotel will be provided. The 2001 CES will not feature exhibits in the Sands Expo and Convention Center.  Attendees also should note that mobile and wireless exhibitors can be found in the Gold Pavilions, located next to the Las Vegas Convention Center, and the Riviera Hotel.<p>To alleviate traffic congestion and bring as many of the exhibitors as possible under one roof, there will be no on-site parking available.  However, CES has arranged for satellite parking with a comprehensive shuttle bus system to transport attendees from local hotels and satellite parking lots to all of the show's exhibit facilities.<p>TARGETING TECHNOLOGY<p>As the center stage for the interaction of content media, delivery and hardware, CES offers the latest in technology for more than 110,000 buyers, installers, financial analysts, developers, engineers, CEOs, media and all related industry professionals.  CES hosts presentations from leading industry visionaries and a variety of special-interest areas that highlight the industry's most recent developments driving the revolution in workstyles and lifestyles.<p>"CES is destined to be the launching pad for an exploding new marketplace focused on home networking and the residential gateway," said Adam Marsh, co-founder and vice president of marketing, Coactive Networks, Sausalito, Calif.<p>"This show is the ideal venue for us to showcase our home networking technology and product solutions," said Mary Walker, chief executive officer, Home Director Inc., Morrisville, N.C.  "Our demonstrations at CES will feature our new product solutions that go beyond the enabling network to focus on benefits to consumers, from shared broadband Internet connections everywhere in the home to whole-house audio and home theater systems.  In addition, CES brings together the world's best technology companies, providing extensive opportunities to discuss alliance agreements for our software applications."<p>"CES, the world's largest consumer electronics event, is THE place to see the future of communications and broadcasting," said Robert Struble, president and CEO, iBiquity Digital, Warrenton, N.J. and Columbia, Md.  "CES is the ideal venue for us to demonstrate our digital radio transmission technology, which will revolutionize the way people listen to AM and FM radio.<p>"International CES is a crucial part of our marketing program every year," said Larry Johannes, director of marketing, Uniden Corp., Fort Worth, Texas.  "This show is often our most important opportunity to introduce our newest products to the industry's most influential buyers.  This year is no different.  We'll be introducing over 25 new products in several emerging categories that take advantage of the convergence of telecommunications, streaming technologies and broadband Internet service.<p>"CES is an important event, not only for large tech companies, but also for smaller start-ups trying to make a name for themselves in a competitive market," said Jeff Shafer, director, corporate communications, ViOS, Cary, N.C.  "It is a great opportunity for us before we launch our 3D Internet Landscape, a 3D interface, free to consumers, that delivers the entire Internet in an exciting new way.  We get to show off our new technology to influential people and get in front of hundreds of potential customers."<p>"As a new company in the telecommunications field, it is a major decision to choose from the various trade shows to get the most from the investment," said Don Wellington, vice president, Avinta Communications Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.  "CES really provides the options to maximize exposure versus expense.  Last year we participated off the floor of the show.  This year we will participate within the Las Vegas Convention Center.  We know we will have great results."<p>The 2001 International CES will feature 13 pavilions spread throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton, the Riviera Hotel and the Alexis Park Hotel.  This year's pavilions include: 1394, Bluetooth, DSL, Digital Car, Digital Imaging, E-Commerce, Emerging Technologies, Home Security, Intelligent Data Bus (IDB), Infrared Data (IrDA), MP3 & Internet Audio, Timepiece and Upside's Digital Living Room.<p>The Innovations 2001 Awards, the consumer technology design awards program sponsored by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and endorsed by the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA), will recognize the best designed and engineered products in 18 categories.  Innovations 2001 winning products will be on display in the Silver Pavilion outside the LVCC.<p>EDUCATION IN ONE PLACE<p>In addition to the pavilions and specialized areas, the 2001 International CES conference program will offer more than 100 sessions led by industry experts and visionaries.  Conference tracks will include: University 4Mobility, Business Solutions, Dataquest Predicts Consumer Technology, Digital Hollywood, Emerging Technologies, the Habitech Institute, Home Entertainment, Mobile, Networking, Wireless and Workstyle.<p>In addition to 11 industry conference tracks, CES will feature four technology pioneers as keynote speakers.  Craig R. Barrett, president and CEO of Intel Corp. will present the Kick-Off Keynote, on Friday, January 5.  On Saturday, January 6, Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect of Microsoft Corp., will deliver the Opening Keynote, and Carl Yankowski, CEO of Palm Inc., will present the Workstyle Keynote.  Barry Schuler, president of America Online Inc.'s Interactive Services Group, also will deliver the Executive Perspective address on Monday, January 8.<p>Most of the sessions require a registration fee, however several keynotes, supersessions and tracks are free to all CES attendees.  Registration fees range from $396 to $99 depending on the number and type of sessions. Complete conference registration information and pricing is available at www.CESweb.org.<br>For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.<p>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) represents more than 600 U.S. companies involved in the development, manufacturing and distribution of audio, video, mobile electronics, communications, information technology, multimedia and accessory products, as well as related services, that are sold through consumer channels.
