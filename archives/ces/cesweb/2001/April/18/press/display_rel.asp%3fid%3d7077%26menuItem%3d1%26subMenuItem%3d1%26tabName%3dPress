	<td><font class="pressReleaseBody">The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced that 122,422 industry professionals from 120 countries came to Las Vegas this week to see the cutting edge in digital technology at the 2001 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology.  The world's largest annual technology tradeshow, featuring 1.2 million net square feet of exhibit space, wrapped up today after four days of conference sessions, keynote speeches and exhibits of the latest developments in consumer electronics technology.<p>"CES reflected the exciting pulse of the technology industry.  Manufacturers, retailers, content providers and creators, broadband developers, installers, engineers, corporate buyers, government leaders, financial analysts and the media all flocked to the show to experience and learn about the latest in workstyle and lifestyle technology," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, the sponsor, producer and manager of CES.  "This year's CES exceeded all of our expectations.  We set records for exhibit space and attendance in many categories, including a record number of high-level government officials.  Moreover, the move to a consolidated venue transformed CES into a four-day connected community."<p>The 2001 attendance total slightly surpassed 2000's record of 122,244 and far exceeded CEA's initial projections of 110,000.  Independently audited attendance numbers from ABC Expomark for the 2001 International CES will be released later this spring.  Endorsed by the International Association of Exposition Management (IAEM), Expomark provides independent third-party audits and industry-developed standards for exhibition attendance, demographic claims and recordkeeping systems.  CES is the largest tradeshow audited by Expomark and normally is accurate within five percentage points of its post-show attendance estimates.<p>The resounding theme of the 2001 International CES was the role of digital technology in consumer electronics.  Exhibitors showcased products as varied and disparate as high-definition televisions, wireless Web access devices and MP3-enabled wrist watches, all of which demonstrated the value that digital technology adds to traditional products and services.  The 2001 show also featured a wide array of new product and business partnership announcements, including the official unveiling of Microsoft's Xbox.<p>"This year's CES showed attendees the power that digital technology can add to their lives," said Karen Chupka, CEA vice president of events and conferences.  "Digital technology is bringing us ever closer to the promise of a networked world - a world in which consumer electronics devices seamlessly connect and communicate with each other to make consumers' lives and work more enjoyable and less complicated."<p>Off the exhibit floor, 110 conference sessions and four keynote speeches by industry giants echoed the digital theme, and educated attendees on new profit opportunities and business models.  Among the leading industry experts who presented at these sessions were:<p>* Craig Barrett, president and CEO, Intel<br>* Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect, Microsoft Corp.<br>* Barry Schuler, president of interactive services, America Online Inc.<br>* Kari-Pekka Wilska, president and CEO, Nokia Inc.<br>* Carl Yankowski, CEO, Palm Inc.<br>* Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT)<br>* Congressman Bob Erlich (R-MD)<br>* Senator Bill Frist (R-TN)<br>* Herbie Hancock, Academy Award-winning jazz musician and five-time Grammy winner<br>* Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA)<br>* Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Susan Ness<br>* FCC Commissioner Michael Powell<br>* Congressman Bobby Rush (D-IL)<br>* Congressman Adam Smith (D-WA)<br>* Congressman Jerry Weller (R-IL)<p>"The energy and momentum from this year's show will continue to build throughout the year and make the 2002 International CES even more exciting," said Chupka.  "With the new expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the 2002 CES will have room to host exhibitors all under one roof, making it easier for attendees to see the entire show.  Already, more than 1,040 companies have signed up for more than 1.1 million square feet of 2002 CES exhibit space during the past four days, an increase of 18 percent over exhibit space sold during the show days of the 2000 CES.  The show floor will once again be filled with the latest and most exciting technologies in consumer electronics."<p>The 2002 International CES will be held Tuesday, January 8 through Friday, January 11, in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas Hilton, and Alexis Park Hotel.

In this way, we are growing the show and the industry."<p>Gayle Sanders, President, Martin-Logan Ltd.<br>"The International CES keeps moving the industry forward."<p>Joe Richter, President, Kenwood U.S.A.

Our expectations were high and were exceeded.  We're expecting a great year based on the outcome of the show.  It was a great show. I'm more positive after this year's CES than any other one we've attended."<p>J. Patrick Quigley, Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President, DataPlay Inc.<br>"There is no other event that can provide us the exposure and quality contacts like CES can.  We feel very grateful that CES was able to present our products and people to the world."<p>Rob Payesko, National Product Manager, Consumer Video Division, JVC Company of America<br>"The traffic was amazing and was the perfect way to get our messages and vision to the press, dealers and consumers.  The exposure CES offers doesn't compare to anything else. This is the show for product introductions.

There's a lot to cover at CES in a short time."<p>Bill Wilson, Club 25 Top Performer, National Cellular Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada<br>"I've been coming to CES for about seven to eight years, from Canada.  I like to check out the wireless innovations and what's new here.  I always look forward to being able to test equipment at the show.

I've been able to spend about three solid days at the show-and needed it!"<p>Mike Mitchell, Installation Manager/Buyer, Radio Active Car Audio, Houston, TX<br>"This is my third year at the show.

The storage media and data play entertainment advances are awesome to see."<p>Robert Liu, Product Manager, University Solutions LLC, Freemont, CA<br>"I come to CES to find new products and know I'll never be disappointed.

They put so much in a tiny chip!"<p>Andre Mendes, Chief Information Officer, PBS, Alexandria, VA<br>"At CES, I know I will have an opportunity to see, test and learn about the newest consumer electronics technology.

I was amazed by the breadth of technology that's here now.  You can find the newest of everything here."<p>Mark Horvath, Multimedia Brand Manager, Interiors/Exterior Systems, Visteon Corp.<br>"CES has been a great show for us. We had lots of traffic. People seem to understand technology more this year, it's no longer just buzzwords. CES is a great educational vehicle for us, especially since we are a spin-off from Ford. People now look for us at CES to see what new things we have."<p>John E. McMahan, Manager, Shows & Exhibits, Delphi Automotive Systems<br>"CES is a good venue for us to show a lot of our products that are consumer related. We usually deal with the OEMs, but when consumers see the devices, it creates demand for the products and that brings it full cycle."<p>Allan Spiro, Marketing Manager, U.S. Paging Operations, PCS Americas Group, Motorola<br>"Traffic at CES has been phenomenal. It has been quite busy during the last four days. Customers are excited to see the solutions Motorola is bringing, and we have received a lot of positive feedback on the products. Add to that our celebrities at the show - our great lineup that leverages our whole NFL promotion - and it has been a positive experience for us and our customers."<p>Keith Nowak, Media Relations Manager, Corporate Communications, Nokia<br>"This has been a good show experience. The media attention has been great. Traffic is good and we have had lots of good appointments. CES is the show where we launched our first consumer product that is not a phone, the Nokia Media Terminal. CES is a good venue for us."<p>John Garlette, Director, Strategic Events & Customer Service, Casio Inc.<br>"It's been a real good show right through today. I thought 16 conference rooms would be enough and it wasn't. I had 12 product demonstrations in addition to the sales force and I even ended up doing product demos. It's really been a positive show. This is my 20th CES. CES sets the benchmark. Everyone else is scrambling to catch up. It has been a terrific lab."<p>Nicole Grani, Manager Worldwide Events, 3Com<br>"CES was awesome as usual. We love the show. The show went great! This is our second year - we had excellent traffic and response from our customers."
