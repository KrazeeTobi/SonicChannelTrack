<br><br>


<a name="best"></a>
TechTV and CES are excited to introduce <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> awards program to the show floor. This program will select 12 products as the best new products debuted at the 2001 International CES. The program is open only to exhibitors at the 2001 CES and only to those products that are introduced at CES 2001 or available for sale after December 7, 2000.<br>
<br>
TechTV attends the Consumer Electronics Show. Visit their official site and <a href="http://www.techtv.com/ces2001">view TechTV's coverage of last year's CES</a>.   Furthermore, you can find out how to nominate your company's product to get the <b>TechTV</b> stamp of approval.<br clear=all>

<br><br>


<a name="about"></a><font class="subhead">About TechTV</font><p>

TechTV, formerly known as ZDTV, is the on-air and online network dedicated to the digital lifestyle. Offering everything from industry news to product reviews, tech stocks to tech support, TechTV's original programming keeps the wired world informed and entertained. TechTV is one of the fastest growing cable networks, currently available in more than 19 million households and distributing content to 64 countries around the world.  With more than 750,000 unique visitors per month, TechTV is a community destination that encourages viewer interaction through e-mail, live chat and video mail. TechTV is owned by Vulcan Ventures Inc.<br>

<br><br>
<a name="v"></a><font class="subhead">How is TechTV's Best of CES award different from the CES Innovation award?</font><p>

The CES Innovation awards focus on the <b>design</b> of the most innovative products of 2001, including products already on the market.  In addition, judges look at pictures, videos and text descriptions of products but do not do any hands-on evaluation.<br>

<br><b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> considers only products that have not yet begun or are just starting to ship.  In addition to reviewing product information, pictures and videos, the judges test each product.<br>

<br>The judging for Innovation is wrapped up by November 17th.  <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> judging happens at the 2001 CES show in January.<br>

<br><br>
<a name="why"></a><font class="subhead">Why should you participate?</font><p>

Being a finalist in <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> awards is a clear indication that your product is one of the top 30 new consumer electronic products to be released in 2001.  Winning the best of category award or being a finalist automatically brands your product as one of the hottest new products to be available in 2001.   Finalists and winners will be able to promote their product's status on the show floor - we'll provide appropriate signage.<br><br>

In addition, finalists and winners will receive unprecedented exposure on TechTV, the only nationwide and international 24-hour cable TV network devoted to covering the digital lifestyle. TechTV will provide significant coverage of finalists and award winners on its daily two-hour live programming originating on the show floor and broadcast around the world.  In addition, TechTV will produce a separate awards show broadcast highlighting finalists and winners that will air on TechTV after CES.<br><br>

Winners also will receive a trophy award for display in their offices, reception area or other locations.<br><br>

Finalists and winners will receive mechanical artwork for inclusion in their ads and product packaging materials. The TechTV and CES awards logo will be an instant brand of quality and capability for consumers.<br><br>

Finally, the media relations departments at both TechTV and CES will ensure that all media covering the 2001 CES have complete knowledge and understanding of winners and finalists.  It's likely that many of those journalists will focus on these "best of" products in their own show coverage.<br>

<br><br>
<a name="categories"></a><font class="subhead">Categories</font><p>

<b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> awards are handed out to the top products in each of ten categories.  Those categories are:
<br>

<br><br>
<a name="how"></a><font class="subhead">How to Enter</font><p>

There is NO FEE to enter <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> awards. To submit your product, you must submit an entry form, two complete press kits, along with product photos and Betacam video, if you have it to, TechTV.  All entries must be received by 5pm Pacific time, December 15, 2000.  Entries must be received by mail. No on-line or fax-based entries will be accepted.

<br><br>
<a name="rules"></a><font class="subhead">Eligibility &amp; Rules</font><p>

In order to be eligible for <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> awards program, the product must be:<br>
<br>
<OL>
<LI>	Displayed publicly and openly on the 2001 CES show floor.
<LI>	Available for purchase after December 7, 2000.
<LI>	Prototypes, pre-releases and beta products are acceptable. The unit must be in complete working order.
<LI>	An individual product only can be entered in one category.  If your product falls into more than one category, pick the category that makes the most sense.  For instance, a digital camera could be both a "mobile device" and a "digital imaging" device, but it's best in the "digital imaging" category.  TechTV reserves the right to move a product to a more appropriate category.
<LI>	Multiple products may be entered in a single category, but each product may be submitted only in one category.
</OL>

<br><br>
<a name="planning"></a><font class="subhead">Planning</font><p>

Because the finalists will receive significant coverage on TechTV and during the awards program, 
we encourage exhibitors to bring at least one extra version of each product entered into the awards
program.  During the actual awards ceremony, finalists will have the opportunity to demonstrate 
their products to media and other VIP attendees at the awards show.  In addition, TechTV will need
to video-tape the product in action, both for the awards show and the TechTV live shows being produced at the 2001 CES.  Your product's chance of appearing on TechTV's programming will be increased, both in the hotels in Las Vegas and nationally on the cable network, if you have an extra sample that can be used for this purpose.<br>
<br>

<a name="criteria"></a><font class="subhead">Judging Criteria</font><p>

Our judges only will evaluate products and prototypes that are being exhibited on the show floor of the 2001 CES. Products will be evaluated based on the following criteria:<br>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Wow Factor:  Does the product create an entirely new market or category, or does it completely change the economics or capability of an existing category.<br>
<LI>Usability and Usefulness:  Does the product actually solve a real problem or address a real need.  Will customers purchase it, and if they do, will they be ecstatic about their new device.<br>
<LI>Value:  Is it affordable, within the constraints of the category, or is it just so expensive that no one will ever buy one
</UL>

<br><br>
<a name="process"></a><font class="subhead">The Judging Process</font><p>

All judging will take place at the 2001 CES.  A team of two judges will be assigned to each category.  During the CES Press Day, Friday January 5th, and the first day of CES, Saturday, January 6th, our judging teams will personally inspect each product by meeting with the manufacturer.  This will take place either in our evaluation area on Friday or at the booth on Saturday.<br><br>

Saturday evening, the judges will select three finalists in each category. On the morning of Sunday, January 7th, finalist awards suitable for placing in show booths will be handed out. In addition, each finalist will be invited to demonstrate his/her product in a special area during the awards presentation and reception to be held Sunday evening.<br><br>

During the day Sunday, the judges will revisit all 30 finalists. On Sunday afternoon, the judges will make the final determination for the winning product in each category. The judges also will pick two products from among the finalists to receive the best of show awards: Best Lifestyle Product and Best Workstyle Product.<br>

<br><br>
<a name="nd"></a><font class="subhead">Non-disclosures</font><p>

TechTV and the judging panel will sign and be bound by non-disclosure statements.  All non-disclosure statements expire as of January 6th when the 2001 CES begins.  To get your NDA signed and returned before submitting your entry, contact the <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> contest coordinator at 415-355-4466.<br>

<br><br>
<a name="awards"></a><font class="subhead">Awards Show</font><p>

On Sunday evening, January 7th from 5:30 to 8:00pm, TechTV and CES will present <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> awards.  Twelve awards will be presented, one for the best product in each of the ten categories, and two overall best of show awards. These two overall awards are the "Best Lifestyle" and "Best Workstyle" products.<br><br>

In addition, all of the finalists will be invited to demonstrate their winning products in the <b>TechTV's Best of CES</b> showcase.  The showcase will be available for viewing by members of the press, VIPs and other attendees to the awards show during the cocktail reception before the awards ceremony and the congratulatory party afterwards.  Each finalist will be given ½ of a table on which to set up their product. We'll accommodate additional space needs as necessary.
