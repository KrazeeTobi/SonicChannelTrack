<font class="subhead"><a href="#car">Digital Car</a></font><br>
As today’s vehicles evolve into entertainment and information centers, drivers are enjoying improved audio, 
video, GPS navigation and Internet connectivity. CES is the place to see the new in-car entertainment systems 
and, in conference sessions, hear how to sell new products while keeping drivers safe.<p>

<font class="subhead"><a href="#dtv">Digital Television (DTV)</a></font><br>
Two years into the transition to digital television-the high quality picture that shows exquisite details and 
color-the growing number of DTV owners shows that DTV is here to stay. Sales are up and progress continues on 
producing more content.<p>

<font class="subhead"><a href="#broad">Broadband</a></font><br>

More service and faster connections-that’s what broadband offers to consumers linking to the Internet. High-speed 
data services and bundles of video, voice and data are opening new market opportunities, including video phones, 
multimedia advertising and virtual real estate shopping.<p>


<font class="subhead"><a href="#digitalradio">Digital Radio</a></font><br>
The digital radio revolution gives American drivers more choices in their cars, including listening to a hometown 
sports station from a thousand miles away. Receivers for digital satellite radio and digital terrestrial radio are 
becoming available this year, and interest is riding high.	<p>

<font class="subhead"><a href="#bluetooth">Bluetooth and Wireless</a></font><br>
Bluetooth enables dozens of wireless products to talk to each other easily, and that success signals a powerful 
change in workstyles and lifestyles. Bluetooth is helping to create a robust wireless Internet and is boosting 
interest in innovative wireless electronic commerce devices. 
<p>


<font class="subhead"><a href="#set">Digital Set-Top Boxes</a></font><br>
The set-top box may become the most versatile electronic box in the home, perhaps even replacing the computer. 
Reducing cost and clutter for consumers, the set-top box could combine cable modem, interactive TV, personal 
video recorder (PVR), satellite tuners and other features. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#digitalImaging">Digital Imaging</a></font><br>
Digital video and photography are changing the way consumers can capture memories and communicate. Users can now 
view, edit, save and send images in ways that were out of reach a year ago. E-mail photos to grandma or breathe 
new life into old home movies-it’s easier than ever. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#homeNetworking">Home Networking</a></font><br>
Home networking simplifies our lives by automatically taking care of the mundane aspects of running a home, linking 
different products so they can work together (like arming the security system and setting back the thermostat or 
turning off the TV) and be controlled remotely. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#mp3">MP3 and Internet Audio</a></font><br>
Internet technology is changing the music industry forever. MP3 technology offers consumers a new way to receive 
and carry free music off the Internet, and as MP3 players shrink in size and grow in storage capacity. <p>
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#teleworking">Teleworking</a></font><br>
Shifting some office work to home is growing more common-about 10 percent of American workers now telecommute. 
Technology makes it easier, and CEA is making the knowledge about how to make teleworking successful widely available. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#dvd">DVD-Audio</a></font><br>
Digital technology is driving a revolution in the musical listening experience, as audio moves from a CD to a 
DVD-based format. DVD, the fastest selling product in the history of consumer electronics, is driving the 
surround experience. Consumers enjoy more choices in DVD players, and more players are being built into 
more components, such as VCRs and TVs. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#pda">PDAs and Handheld Computing</a></font><br>
Today's handheld computer expands a consumer’s power to deal with work and life through such common PC functions 
as word processing, spreadsheets, games, e-mail and Web surfing. PDAs and handhelds work through a variety of 
input methods, such as keyboards, pens and voices, and usually can interface with personal computers for file 
updates and synchronization.
<p>

<a name="car"></a>
<font class="subhead">Digital Car</a></font><p>
In 2001, more drivers are adding games, movies, GPS navigation, music and e-mail access to their dashboards 
or back seat consoles. This rich product mix is evolving under the watchful eye of the Consumer Electronics 
Association, which aims to make lifestyle and workstyle simpler, while keeping the driver’s attention on the road.
<p>
Products that once featured only navigation systems (GPS) have broadened to include more information, entertainment 
and computer power. Some can play DVD videos or MP3 music files. DVD players may become standard in new vehicles 
in the United States in the next few years. Satellite radio-capable cars now offer 200 new channels from virtually 
anywhere in the United States. 
<p>
Since Americans are in their vehicles for 500 million commuter hours each week, CES targets that market by 
showcasing telematics, the convergence of wireless and GPS technology with a car’s electronics. According 
to CEA research, by 2004 a fourth of consumers will own telematics devices, which offer route guidance, 
roadside assistance and Internet access. 
<p>
When adding aftermarket electronics, installation issues have challenged the industry.  One solution is the 
Intelligent Data Bus (IDB), a way to connect in-car electronics so everything works together. At CES 2002, 
IDB will again be explored and explained.
<p>
IDB and digital wireless connectivity have changed mobile electronics, and opportunities abound for retailers to 
bring these features to consumers. Conferences at CES also will help retailers know how to select the perfect mix 
of car navigation, DVD, mobile video and MP3 products to reach both new and established customers.
<p>


<a name="dtv"></a>
<font class="subhead">Digital Television (DTV)</a></font><p>

Consumers need to witness what DTV has to offer first hand. More than 60 percent of those seeing HDTV for the first time are amazed by the superior quality and can't wait to own a set. It is hard to go back to the TV they have at home-more than half claim that once they have seen DTV quality they are unsatisfied with analog. 
<p>
Everyone who has had the opportunity to see content in high-definition can understand why consumers are impressed. The true test is whether or not consumers will buy. And seeing really is believing-nearly 80 percent of those who have visited a retailer to see or ask about DTV expect their next TV to be a DTV.
<p>
For the 4 out of 10 consumer electronics retailers who have taken the plunge and begun to sell DTV products, there have been rewards. More than half report that their sales of HDTV products have met or exceeded expectations, but that isn't the only benefit of carrying these products. Increased traffic flow thanks to the 16 million families who have visited stores so far to see or inquire about DTV promote sales of all consumer electronics products. And they keep coming back. More than half of consumers who have visited a retail store looking for DTV plan on returning in the next 3 months. 
<p>
Once buyers have a DTV set, now what? Many owners have gotten their new high-definition set home only to discover they can't take full advantage of their new investment. The lack of content currently being broadcast in high-definition has gotten many owners down. However, they are optimistic: 82 percent expect three quarters of the programs they currently watch to be broadcast in HD within two years. Until that happens, they are using their new high priced set to watch DVDs or plain old analog programming.

<a name="broad"></a>
<font class="subhead">Broadband</a></font><p>
<font class="body">
A hundred years ago, one landline phone in someone's house was cause for celebration. How times change. Now, the emergence of cable television, the Internet, direct broadcast satellite services, and scores of new household appliances and devices are fast making those narrowband days a thing of, well... the past. To be sure, broadband deployment is far from ubiquitous, however industry experts expect it to dominate the decade. 
<p>
In fact, most people still have no access to high-speed data services in their homes, and broadband penetration will continue to spread slowly for the next few years. But now few people talk about the Internet as a "fad" or write off the promise of interactive television as a pipe dream. The momentum is real. And it's only going to increase in the coming months and years.
<p>
At the outset, the two main opponents in the broadband battle are cable operators and telephone companies. The cable industry has been rolling out cable modems across the country, trying to leverage its huge presence in residential video services to create a bundle of video, voice and data services-all based on the idea that consumers will flock to anything that speeds up the World Wide Wait. 
<p>
Perhaps, more than anything, the biggest opening for consumer electronics companies in the coming months and years will be all of the new devices and gadgets that broadband connectivity makes possible.  Consider the fact that most household devices and appliances currently have no way to connect to the Internet and-when they do-are generally designed for a slower, narrowband world.

<font class="subhead">Digital Radio</a></font><p>

With the introduction of two new digital technologies in 2001, American consumers soon will 
have a multitude of digital audio choices available in their cars. Expect receivers for digital 
satellite radio and digital terrestrial radio to start trickling into the U.S. marketplace in 2001. 
And if the business plans of three companies come true, the analog radio sound that has been with 
us since Pittsburgh's KDKA was licensed in the 1920s will be just a fading, fizzing, popping dream.<p>

But consumers cannot hear the crystal clear reception of local AM and FM radio and the varied 
content of national satellite radio with today's radios. Get set for the radio receiver market to 
heat up.  The first generation of these receivers will debut at CES.<p>

In the satellite arena, two companies obtained spectrum from the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) in 1997 to provide satellite digital audio radio service (SDARS). Sirius Satellite 
Radio and XM Satellite Radio expect to each beam 100 channels of digital music and talk formats 
from the stars by mid-year 2001 for coast-to coast coverage.<p>

Meanwhile, iBiquity Digital is finalizing development on a technology that will allow earthbound 
stations the opportunity to go digital. The in-band, on-channel digital audio broadcasting (iDAB) 
technology allows radio stations to simulcast digital and analog signals on the same frequency. 
Stations are expected to begin adding digital to their signals in 2001 pending the resolution of 
certain technological and regulatory hurdles. <p>

<font class="subhead">Bluetooth and Wireless</font><p>


With the next generation of mobile phones, you will be able
to surf the Web; respond to e-mail; and verify flight, hotel and rental car
information—all from your mobile phone or PDA. The technology called Bluetooth
enables users to connect computing and telecommunications devices easily
without cables. Bluetooth makes this possible through inexpensive short-range,
low power, point-to-multipoint radio frequency (RF) links. Bluetooth enables a
cell phone to take on some of the functions of a PC. 
<p>
Other wireless technologies exist, but many companies are
favoring Bluetooth. IBM is planning to put Bluetooth in all of its PC products,
for example.
<p>
Cost and functionality make Bluetooth popular. Right now,
most TV remote controls, computer laptops and Palm Pilots use an infrared
device that transmits at about 10 kilobits and only works when the device is
within line-of-sight. Bluetooth can run at 1 MB, costs little and works even
when the other device is out of the line of sight. 
<p>
Bluetooth also enjoys the support of a large number of
companies. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), comprised of close to
1,400 companies, shows close cooperation among telecommunications, computer,
automotive, medical and consumer electronics industries. 
<p>
Cahners In-Stat Group is forecasting that Bluetooth-enabled
equipment will easily exceed 200 million units by 2003 and that 670 million
Bluetooth-enabled devices will be in use by 2005. 
<p>
<b>What is Bluetooth?</b>
<br>
Bluetooth received its colorful name from King Harald Blatand (Bluetooth) a
tenth century Danish Viking who conquered many obstacles to unite his
territory. Bluetooth wireless technology is a standard for short-range radio
links between mobile PCs, wireless phones and other portable devices. 
<p>
For information on Bluetooth technology and its
applications, check out <a
href="http://www.ce.org/vision_magazine/editions/2000/mayjune/p13_15.asp">Consumer
Electronics Vision's article by Susan Schreiner</a>.

Bluetooth will be among the most talked about technologies
at the 2002 International CES. For information on the Bluetooth Pavilion at the

Digital Set-Top Boxes</font><p>


The variety of new combination set-top boxes (STB) will reduce set-top clutter as well as cost, plus add entirely new functions.  Eventually the STB may ride the tide of convergence to supplant the PC as the most versatile electronic box in the home. 
<p>
WebTV, perhaps the first sign of PC/TV convergence and renamed Ultimate TV, is hardly the last. As more cable companies offer two-way broadband data service-what could be more natural than to combine a cable modem with an STB? AOL, the world's biggest e-mail and Internet service provider, just purchased cable giant Time-Warner and has launched its own interactive TV service, AOLTV. Philips has already revealed an AOLTV set-top box, and AOL also is working with DirecTV, Hughes Network Systems, TiVo and Liberate Technologies. 
<p>
A new RCA box that combines a disk-based PVR, Ultimate TV and dual-satellite tuners exemplify convergence by conglomeration. The dual-tuners allow DirecTV picture- in-picture (PIP) viewing, recording one satellite program while viewing another, or independent satellite-video feeds to two zones of a multiroom system. Satellite/cable combination boxes seem less likely, although some DBS viewers do use cable for viewing local channels. 
<p>
And while cable companies were the first to bring broadband data service to home users, the telephone companies have been aggressively marketing broadband data service via DSL. Now, they're looking to get into the television delivery service, too. Telephone companies hope to pull off video-on-demand (VOD) to anyone familiar with the narrowband sound of ordinary telephony, this seems like science fiction, but working demonstrations have been shown within the industry for the last couple of years. 
<p>
Perhaps more practical is the idea of using telephone broadband lines to deliver programming in off-peak hours to a recorder at the consumer's end. That application would require good integration with a video recorder, probably a PVR that could go in the same STB as the telco interface. 
<p>

<font class="subhead">Digital Imaging</font><p>
If the old adage suggests a picture paints a
thousand words, then the words evoked by the digital images being transmitted
across computers today must number in the multi-billions, each personalized to
the exact tenor and taste of their originator.
<p>
A new and powerful army of product suites are
making their way into consumers' hands that empower users to capture, view,
edit, save and send images in ways that were quite simply out of reach only a
year or two ago. These digital cameras and camcorders, expanded editing
software packages and other facilitating technologies are melding in a rainbow
of applications, ranging from e-mailing photos of the kids to grandma to
breathing new life into old home movies to creating and editing digital movies
that can "screen" on a variety of formats.
<p>
According to the results of the Consumer
Electronics Association’s (CEA) "Digital Camera Owners Profile"
survey, nearly 48 percent of owners claim the main reason for purchasing a
digital camera was to post pictures to a website. 
<p>
In addition to posting photos, digital camera
owners also engage in a variety of other activities that enhance the sharing of
experiences. Eighty percent of owners declared having e-mailed a photo taken
with a digital camera, 82 percent have printed a photo, and 26 percent viewed a
photo on their TV.
<p>
Ownership of a digital camera also correlates to
an increase in photography. Fifty-eight percent of owners reported an increase
in the total number of photos taken after the purchase of their digital camera.
The typical owner takes approximately 37 pictures per month with their digital
camera. Little difference was found to exist among gender, age or income
segments when considering usage.
<p>
CEA projects that digital camera total factory
sales will reach $2.9 billion in the United States for 2001.

<font class="subhead">Home Networking</font><p>

More people are equipping their houses with a full range of networked systems that can control everything ranging from 
programming their alarm systems to setting up their heating and lighting to distributing television and Internet 
connections. 
<p>
The home networking industry has come a long way since the first remote controls and timers came onto the market about 
twenty years ago, and the industry has grown in scope to reflect this coming of age. 
Early home automation systems aimed to simplify our lives by automatically taking care of the mundane aspects of 
running a home, like turning lights on and off or putting appliances on a schedule. Integrated home systems (IHS) 
sought to link independent systems and appliances so they could work together and be controlled from other sources, 
so arming the security system could set back the thermostat for example. 
<p>
Home networking brings the power of distributed content to the home's automated and integrated systems. And the 
proliferation of digital technology in a multitude of devices promises to change the market even more dramatically.  
Just as the personal computer revolutionized the way we communicate, the home networking market could be the next phase 
of technology that changes how we live. 
<p>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) defines a home network as follows: a home network facilitates communication 
among the appliances, home systems, entertainment products and information devices in a home, so they can work 
cooperatively and share information. This allows users to get information about the home's condition and remotely 
control home systems and appliances, as well as provide access to information and entertainment resources outside the 
home. 
<p>
According to a CEA survey of 1000 consumers in April of this year, consumers share the industry's excitement about the 
future of networking digital products, as long as the information is immediately applicable to them. Entertainment 
content such as music and video are among the most popular types of content consumers would like distributed around the 
house earning 59 and 47 percent respectively.
<p>
For more information, check out <a href="http://www.ce.org/vision_magazine/categories/homenet.asp"><i>Consumer Electronics Vision</i></a> magazine's articles on Home Networking.

<font class="subhead">MP3 and Internet Audio</font><p>
Last year MP3 took the country by storm. At the 2000 International CES, more than a dozen new MP3 players debuted.  MP3 technology offers consumers a new way to carry and receive free music off the Internet. MP3 technology is going to change the way music is sold and listened to forever. <p>

According to a Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) survey, 65 percent of multimedia PC households with Internet access have listened to a sound file from an Internet Web page and that number is growing daily. <p>

MP3 is an acronym for MPEG 3, which is itself an acronym for Motion Picture Expert Group-1, Audio Layer-3. MPEG defines digital video and audio data compression standards. Because they are open standards, nobody owns them, and they are available free or for a small fee. <p>

MP3 has become the commonly accepted term for one of the many compression algorithms, also known as codecs, available for downloading digital music files from the Internet. For example, MP3 can compress the size of a five-minute CD track from about 50 megabytes to five megabytes and the download time to your computer's hard drive from about two hours to ten minutes.<p>

CEA's Generation Y: Home Entertainment Market Overview found among the online segment of Gen Y (approximately 60 percent), 57 percent have played an MP3 music file. Although sound quality expectations vary, the data suggests that the majority of Gen Y listening to the MP3 format rate its sound quality as comparable to a typical stereo. <p>

In addition, the study shows that Gen Y is moving away from the traditional stereo system for listening to music. Approximately 14 percent of respondents claimed to use their PC more than a traditional stereo for listening to music. Another one in four claimed to use both with approximately the same frequency; meaning that nearly 40 percent of Generation Y is using the PC as much as or more than a stereo for listening to music. <p>

<font class="subhead">Teleworking</font><p>
As employees and organizations continue to experiment with alternative work
arrangements and as flexible scheduling grows common, the Internet and advanced
communication products are enabling home-based workers to have the same access
to online resources as their colleagues and competitors who work in traditional
settings. 
<p>
Teleworking
allows employees to schedule home and work activities as necessary and gives
them the flexibility to manage their time. The increased emphasis on speed and
accountability in the new economy is quickly replacing the idea that "face
time" at the office is the most important thing. Instead of being
responsible for their time, teleworkers now are responsible for their work
product.
<p>
This blurring of work and home life is being enabled by digital technology that
allows an office to be located anywhere—the city, the suburbs or a mountain
top—using a range of workstyle products including pagers, wireless phones,
PDAs, laptops and of course, the desktop PC. Digital imaging, wireless devices,
Internet access devices, portable peripherals and handheld navigational
equipment are the epitome of "convergence" incorporating technology
from the telecom, PC and consumer electronics industries.

<font class="subhead">DVD-Audio</font><p>

DVD, the fastest selling product in the history of consumer
electronics, is driving the surround experience.Considering its many applications for audio, video and data, it
truly is a “digital versatile disc.”
<p>
DVD-ROM drives are fast becoming a standard feature, making
surround sound a reality on our PCs either through a four- or five-channel
speaker system, or through a two-speaker array creating a virtual experience.
Since the user is in a near-field listening environment, either approach is
effective.
<p>
In 2000, CEA numbers show factory sales of DVD-Video players
to be more than 6.6 million units. For 2001, sales are projected to exceed 9
million units, ringing up more than $2 billion in total factory sales. In
addition to playing movie soundtracks in Dolby Digital or DTS, DVD-Video
players can play the new 5.1 multichannel music discs, which appeared on the
market in anticipation of a DVD-Audio solution.The success of DVD in the marketplace should guarantee the
success of any new DVD-based mulitchannel audio format such as DVD-Audio and
Super Audio CD (SACD).
<p>
Surround music means that at home, you will be
able to hear music the same way the musicians and engineers do while playing or
mixing music. The sonic realism and depth of this new listening experience is
dramatically different from what we have come to expect.

<font class="subhead">PDAs and Handheld Computing</font>
<p>
These days, handhelds are not only commonplace for business travelers and
information professionals.They're being mainstreamed into both consumer and business-to-business applications. 
handhelds are changing the way we think of computers and revolutionizing the way we work and live.
<p>
A technology first popularized by companies such as Sharp Electronics Corp.,
Casio Inc. and Psion in the late 1980s, the personal digital assistant, or PDA,
was the genesis of the handheld computer of today. The PDA was envisioned as a
portable computing device that could deliver finite chunks of data, such as
schedules and address books, without the need for a separate PC system.
<p>
Almost a decade later, most of these proprietary systems have largely settled under
one of several technological umbrellas that offer consumers outstanding
capabilities and convenience. Today's handhelds offer such common PC functions
as word processing, spreadsheets, games, e-mail and Web surfing. They work
through a variety of input methods, such as keyboards, pen-type input and voice
recording, and typically are able to interface with personal computers for file
updates and synchronization.
