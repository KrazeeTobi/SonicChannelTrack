<b>All members of the CEA and CES family are deeply saddened by the tragic and horrific events in New York City, southwestern Pennsylvania, and in our own immediate neighborhoods of Arlington, Va. and the Greater Washington, D.C. area.  
<p>
We extend our sympathies, condolences and prayers to all those affected.  Words alone cannot express the depth of our feelings.  
<p>America’s commitment to freedom and liberty shall not be undermined or deterred.  The words “one nation, indivisible” have never been truer.</b>
