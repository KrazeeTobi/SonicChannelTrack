<span class="subhead">The Consensus Is In: 2002 International CES is a Phenomenal Success</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/11/2002</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced today that some 100,000 industry professionals from 125 countries came to Las Vegas this week to see the latest and greatest in workstyle and lifestyle technologies at the 2002 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  America's largest technology tradeshow (by a factor of two) with 1.2 million net square feet of exhibit space wrapped up today after four days of conference sessions, keynote speeches, technology pavilions and exhibits showcasing the hottest in consumer electronics technology.<p>

"We are thrilled with the strong turnout for this year's CES," said CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro.  "Our 2002 exhibitors are highly pleased with the attendance and floor traffic.  By any measure, this has been one of our most successful shows in history, particularly given the economic recession, post 9/11 concerns about travel and the fact that this is the first time the CES has been held solely on weekdays."<p>

"Virtually all of our attendees and exhibitors left Las Vegas excited, energized and abuzz about the consumer technology industry," said Shapiro.  "They marveled over the products and technologies, the keynotes and conferences, and they even praised the new facility at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  Consumer technology is hot, and the 2002 CES helped turn up the heat."<p>

"The CES has exceeded our expectations," said Manny Cortez, president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.  "As the first major tradeshow of the year, the CES sets the tone for tradeshows for the remainder of the year.  From our taxis to our hotels from our restaurants to our stores, we greatly appreciate the more than $156 million in non-gaming revenue that CES brings to our city each year."<p>

The focus of the 2002 International CES was the evolution of more powerful and efficient wireless and digital technologies in the areas of video, high-end or "extreme" audio, wireless communications, accessories, consumer electronics fashion, consumer technology networking, broadband, mobile electronics, content media, new business technology, delivery systems and the Internet.   Smaller, thinner technologies on display were evidence that exhibitors are busy upgrading their products to make them more compact and efficient and shouldering the notion that "bigger is better."<p>

"Now more than ever, consumers are treating our products as less of a luxury and more of a necessity.  The need to stay connected with friends, family and co-workers is crucial to managing our active lives," stated Shapiro.  "CES exhibitors recognize that demand, and the 2002 show floor reflected that with some amazing advances in consumer electronics technology."<p>

More than 250 wireless exhibitors showered the show floor with amazing new technologies.  Carriers such as Sprint and Verizon joined wireless manufacturers and distributors, including Audiovox, Brightpoint, Cellstar, Kyocera, Nokia and Samsung to showcase the hottest wireless products and services.  In addition to a Sprint keynote address and several conferences focusing on wireless technologies, wireless products were abundant on the show floor, including the Wherify Personal GPS Locator, the BeAtHome Energy Management System, the Prolite Wireless Mouse and the I300 Palm Powered Phone.<p>

CES was the platform for many companies including Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Philips, Pioneer, Runco, Samsung, Sony, Sanyo Fisher, Sharp, Thomson, Toshiba and Zenith to display the latest advancements in video, including digital television (DTV).  Much like wireless, video technologies are being incorporated into many different product areas, and this convergence was evident on the show floor.  Products such as the Panasonic Desktop LCD TV/DVD Player, the SONICblue Replay TV, the DIRECWAY Gateway by Hughes Network Systems and the DishPVR 721 by EchoStar were just some of the latest video products on the show floor this week.  The continued relevant success of DTV was reflected at this year's CES with more than 10 companies displaying DTV products.<p>

Home networking and entertainment continued to gain ground, with the home intranet becoming almost as big of a driver as the Internet. Such products on display included the Kenwood Sovereign Entré Entertainment Hub, the Xanboo Wireless Internet Home Management System and Moxi Digital's Moxi Media Center.<p>

Digital and high-end audio was displayed prominently on the LVCC show floor and at the Alexis Park Hotel.  The 2002 CES featured a number of the most recent exciting innovations in audio, including MP3, PC audio receivers, DVD Audio, Super Audio CD (SACD) and THX for home theater applications, among others.   The demand for smaller, more portable technologies enabling consumers to listen and streamline music and audio was evident with such products on display as the Cassiopiea Pocket Manager and Akron Networks' G24 Internet Communicator System.<p>
 
Housing the world's largest mobile electronics display, new products on the show floor reflected the demand for technology in the automobile.  In-car entertainment, navigational and security technology and driver safety were addressed in several exhibits and conferences.  Many exhibitors including Alpine, Audiovox, Blaupunkt, Clarion, Firstech, JVC, Pioneer and Sony displayed their products at CES.  Pioneer's XM satellite radio tuner and Sirius' Kenwood radio tuner were just a few of the satellite radio receivers showcased here this week as well.<p>

CES continued to be the venue for leading industry visionaries to launch products and describe their vision for the future of the industry.  Five keynote addresses began on Monday evening with a pre-show address by Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect for Microsoft.  Gates referred to the 21st century as the start of the "digital decade," and talked about several products such as computers, wireless phones and others all working together and sharing information.<p>

Dr. Daeje Chin, president and CEO of digital media business for Samsung Electronics, gave the opening keynote address to officially kick off the 2002 CES.  Chin focused on consumers' needs in a digital age and how Samsung will address those needs by offering convergence of not only products, but services as well, to create a virtual seamless way of receiving information.<p>

In another packed keynote, Carly Fiorina, CEO of Hewlett-Packard, explained her vision for HP and its role in digital imaging.  Fiorina summarized the importance of digital imaging in the consumer marketplace and how HP will transform that sector of the industry.  She displayed one of HP's more popular digital cameras and a photo printer.  She stressed the ease of connecting the products both with and without the use of a PC.<p>

In a Wednesday afternoon keynote address, Gerard Kleisterlee, president and CEO of Royal Philips Electronics, gave his vision of how electronics will evolve by the year 2020.  During his journey through time, Kleisterlee stressed Philips strong commitment to success and driving industry standards, and displayed audio and video products that will "change the way you hear and see forever."<p>

Closing out the keynote sessions, William Esrey, chairman and CEO of Sprint Corp., outlined the future of wireless communications.  He launched into a series of demonstrations, illustrating the power and flexibility the next generation of wireless services will bring to consumers, including imaging features, advanced messaging capabilities, location-based services and increased gaming options.  Esrey also touted the company's first high-profile sneak peek of its 3G products and services which will allow carriers to deliver new services that will further integrate wireless communications into consumers' daily lives.<p>

New this year, CES unveiled its first fashion show further blurring the line between fashion, products and accessories.  Using the underlying themes of color, fashion and future, models strut the runway with the latest in clothes, accessories and wearable products to the delight of hundreds of attendees on the first and second levels of the Grand Lobby.<p>

Off the exhibit floor, more than 100 conference sessions and seven SuperSessions by industry giants echoed the digital theme and educated attendees on new profit opportunities and business models.  Among the leading industry experts who presented at these sessions were:<p>

* Brad Anderson, vice chairman and COO, Best Buy Co. Inc.<br>
* Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO, Amazon.com<br>
* Mark Cuban, chairman and president, HDNet<br>
* Chuck D, Rapstation.com<br>
* Greg Drew, president and CEO, 800.com<br>
* Allan McCullough, president and CEO, Circuit City<br>
* Leonard Roberts, chairman and CEO, Radio Shack<br>
* Meg Whitman, president and CEO, eBay<p>

In addition, CES attracted more than 80 government attendees, the largest turnout in CES history. Distinguished guests included:<p>
* Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT)<br>
* Sen. John Ensign (R-NV)<br>
* Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT)<br>
* Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX)<br>
* Rep. Charles Bass (R-NH)<br>
* Rep. Michael Bilirakis (R-FL)<br>
* Rep. Steve Buyer (R-IN)<br>
* Rep. Susan Davis (D-CA)<br>

* Rep. Denis Moore (D-KS)<br>
* Rep. Michael Oxley (R-OH)<br>
* Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA)<br>
* Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI)<br>
* Rep. Jerry Weller (R-IL)<p>

In addition to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioners Kathleen Abernathy, Michael Copps, Kevin Martin and Chairman Michael Powell, CES was honored to have Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners Sheila Foster Anthony and Mozelle Thompson, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, Undersecretary of Commerce Phil Bond and Undersecretary of Commerce Grant Aldonas.<p>

Other industry leaders included executives from the cable industry, representatives from more than 30 associations and board members of the Interactive Entertainment Media Association.<p>

The 2002 CES was the platform for two major industry announcements.  Shapiro unveiled the merger of CEA with the Home Automation and Networking Association (HANA).  "With more consumer electronics products becoming network ready, CEA has a critical role to play to help grow the home automation and networking sector of our industry," said Shapiro.  "This merger will allow us to expand and improve our services to this important and growing sector of the industry."<p>

In addition, CEA and Deutsche Messe AG (the Hannover Trade Fair Authority, or DMAG), owner and organizer of CeBIT Hannover, announced a partnership to co-organize and launch CeBIT CES Consumer Electronics Show.  CeBIT CES will provide a platform for the 1.3 billion people of China to access the exciting world of the consumer electronics industry.  The event will take place from May 29 - June 1, 2002, at the New International Expo Center in Shanghai, China.<p>

While attendance dropped from CES record breaking shows in 2000 and 2001, the 2002 attendance total of 97,962 surpassed the 1999 mark of 97,370.  Independently audited attendance numbers from ABC Expomark for the 2002 International CES will be released later this spring.  Endorsed by the International Association of Exposition Management (IAEM), Expomark provides independent third-party audits and industry-developed standards for exhibition attendance, demographic claims and record-keeping systems.  CES is the largest tradeshow audited by Expomark and normally is accurate within five percentage points of its post-show attendance estimates.<p>

"The excitement created from this CES will carry on throughout the year as more advances are made in consumer electronics, and this revolutionary movement will lead the way to another exciting show in 2003," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences, CEA.  "Already, more than 900 companies have signed up for nearly 950,000 square feet of 2003 CES exhibit space during the past four days.  We have every indication that the 2003 CES will again be THE venue for showcasing the latest and greatest in consumer electronics technology."<p>

The 2003 International CES will be held Thursday, January 9 through Sunday, January 12, in Las Vegas.  For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org.<p>

"This has been the best show, by far, for us.  Our booth is too crowded - we have taken 50 percent more space for next year."<p>

Stephen Witt<br>
Vice President, Brand Marketing<br>
Alpine Electronics America<br>
"The car companies have been here in great numbers.  This show stands out as the place to see what's happening in mobile."<p>

Lloyd Ivey<br>
Chairman and CEO<br>
Mitek Corp.<br>
"Awesome show!  2002 should be a great year and the CES will jump start the new year."<p>

Kathy Gornik<br>
President<br>
Thiel Audio Products Company<br>
"The show was full of high-quality traffic.  You could sense a feeling of optimism in the industry."<p>

Charlie Randall<br>
President<br>
McIntosh Laboratory Inc.<br>
"The floor traffic was phenomenal.  The show was a great success for us."<p>

Dave Arland<br>
Thomson Multimedia Inc.<br>
"Thomson had a wonderful CES.  Like never before, we're seeing retailers and buyers interested in how digital technology can transform their sales floor.  Everyone here at the show is excited about new technologies and products.  We're seeing a real momentum behind digital largely because of DVD, which is now driving new digital products, home theater, audio systems and more.  We're also seeing a surprising interest in widescreen TV."<p>

Ted Peck<br>
Senior Field Quality Specialist<br>
Sharp<br>
"The show was fantastic.  Everything worked like clockwork.  Sharp is really looking forward to the 2003 CES."<p>

Rolanda Hines<br>
Mercedes Benz<br>
"It has been swamped.  We have had a great show.  We look forward to returning next year."<p>

Jack Amoroso<br>
Audiofile Home Theater<br>
"The new South Hall is really nice.  The show has been so good that we are moving up from a 10 foot by 10 foot space this year to a 20 foot by 20 foot next year."<p>

Brant Williams<br>
CEO<br>
DPP Innovations<br>
Wireless World Inc<br>
"The orders were great.  We absolutely will be back next year.  The people that came to our booth were the right people.  I wrote an order for $200,000 here.  I got orders from many of the large retail chains for our new product.  We developed some new packaging but it was really all because of this show.  CNET was just here giving us more exposure.  I already ordered a 20 by 20 for next year."<p>

Yannin Gale<br>
Senior Manager, Research and Development/Product Development/Marketing<br>
Eclipse by Fujitsu<br>
"The show has been very strong.  The quantity of people was lower, but the quality was actually higher.  We had the time to spend with the real guys, and were able to work less while achieving more.  Overall, a good show."
