	<font size="-1"><b>New Wireless Technology Showcased At CES</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 4 2000
	<BR>
	Attendees at the 2000 International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, January 6-9 in Las Vegas, can preview the newest in Bluetooth technology, the latest phenomenon to strike the world of wireless technology standards.  Many of the founders and driving members of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and recently formed Bluetooth Promoter Group will be at CES displaying the latest Bluetooth compatible products from Acer, Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Lucent, Motorola, Nokia, Philips, Siemens, Sony and Microsoft.   Other Bluetooth proponents at CES include 3Com, Proxim and TDK.     <P>
"With Bluetooth at CES, it's an indication of the excitement and enthusiasm that this technology is creating among a broad and disparate group - and that all of these leaders in this new market view CES as the first significant showcase for Bluetooth in the new millennium," said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president. <P>
 Bluetooth brings to life the promise of a new generation of wireless consumer electronics and information appliances, enabling the seamless wireless networking, integration and connectivity of arbitrary devices.  It heralds a wireless, interconnected universe extending from phones, PDAs, laptops, MP3 players, information appliances and camcorders to the wireless home networking of TV, audio and video equipment - with easy accessibility while traveling, shopping at the mall or on an airplane.  It also enables wireless connectivity with the Internet.  <P>
 The underlying technology is based on low-cost, short-range radio links among devices such as mobile PCs, phones and other portable devices. The Bluetooth compatibility standard is gaining acceptability among hardware companies and momentum in the world of software, particularly with Microsoft's recent announcement of support.  <P>
 While the computer, consumer electronics and communications industries are working together to develop common standards and specifications, "it is interesting to note the different visions for Bluetooth technology - and to consider that these diverse visions converge at CES," commented Lycett.      <P>
 Some see the Internet-enabled wireless phone at the center of a mobile information society where Bluetooth is the key enabler.  Others see the Bluetooth-enabled wireless phone as only a portal to a larger market.  Some see it as an enabler for consumer electronics - with Ericsson, Nokia, Philips, Sony and Toshiba having formed a working group focused on audio and video products and specifications.   And yet others have formed a working group to examine the use of Bluetooth for PC joysticks, keyboards and mice.  <P>
 CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
 As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
