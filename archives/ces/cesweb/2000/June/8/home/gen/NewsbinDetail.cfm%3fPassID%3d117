	<font size="-1"><b>CEA Honors Respected Industry Veterans</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, Nev. - Jan, 6 2000
	<BR>
	Today here at the 2000 International CES,  Chairman of Casio Computer Co. Toshio Kashio and TWICE Editor-in-Chief  Robert Gerson, were honored with the first Consumer Electronics Association  (CEA) Lifetime Achievement awards. The awards were announced in conjunction  with the unveiling of the 50 inaugural inductees to the Consumer Electronics  Hall of Fame this morning. <P>
	“Toshio Kashio and Bob Gerson exemplify the innovative spirit and  commitment that have made the consumer electronics industry so successful,”  said Shapiro.  “Both of these industry professionals have earned the respect  of their colleagues which is why I am proud to present them with this well  deserved award.” <P>
	At Casio, Tashio, along with his brothers Tadao, Kazuo and Yukio, has been  responsible for bringing to market such ground-breaking products as  mini-calculators, pocket-sized TV sets, electronic musical instruments and  sophisticated watches that are tiny information centers. Tashio invented the  world’s first relay-type calculator, the Model 14-A, in June 1957. At that  time, most calculators were electromechanical devices, in which electrical  power was used to drive internal gears. Toshio, however, adapted the relay  elements used for telephone switching equipment to develop the compact,  all-electric calculator. <P>
In the late 1970s, Toshio believed that the same technology and mass  production techniques that revolutionized the calculator and watch  businesses could transform the world of musical instruments. Toshio, an  amateur musician, launched the Casio Musical Instrument Division in 1978 and  two years later unveiled the first portable keyboards, the Casiotone 201. It  was the first instrument in the world that could produce 49 different types  of sounds. <P>
Robert E. Gerson, editor-in-chief of TWICE, a bi-weekly news magazine for  consumer electronics/appliance retailers, has been reporting on the consumer  electronics industry for 38-years. His objective and insightful writing have  made him a respected and influential industry journalist. <P>
A former weekly newspaper editor and Congressional aide, Gerson joined the  industry in 1962 as marketing and communications co-ordinator for the New  York office of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. In 1968,  Gerson joined Television Digest, the authoritative industry newsletter,  where he built his reputation as a trade journalist and became managing  editor of the New York office. He left Television Digest in July of 1986 to  help launch TWICE. Under his editorial guidance, the publication has become  one of the leading news source for consumer electronics and appliance  retailers, manufacturers, distributors, trade groups and security analysts. For more news on CES during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the  interactive source for CES information. <P>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is a sector of the Electronic  Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade  organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEA  represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories,  mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia  products that are sold through consumer channels. <P>
As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES—Your Source  for Workstyle and Lifestyle TechnologySM, CEA reinvests all profits from CES  into industry services, including technical training and education, product  promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and  governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event  of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st  century technology.  <P>
