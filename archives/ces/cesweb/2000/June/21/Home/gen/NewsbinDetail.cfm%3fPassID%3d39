	<font size="-1"><b>Digital Technology For The New Millennium To Be Showcased At The 2000 International CES - New Products For Consumers' Workstyles and Lifestyles</b></font>

	<p>New York City, NY - Oct, 20 1999
	<BR>
	The 2000 International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology will showcase digital content, delivery and hardware technology for the new millennium throughout the exhibit floor and conferences.  Attendees to the International CES, to be held January 6-9, 2000 in Las Vegas, Nev., will see the digital technology applications for consumers' workstyles and lifestyles, including digital audio and video, information technology, home networking, mobile electronics, wireless communications, content media, delivery systems, e-commerce and accessory products.  <P>
"CES is the world's launch pad for the digital millennium," said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA).  "This show is the century's first major event, and more than 90,000 international industry professionals-manufacturers, retailers, content providers and creators, broadband developers, installers, engineers, corporate buyers, government leaders, financial analysts and the media-are expected to attend." <P>
With digital technology creating a bridge between information technology (IT) and traditional consumer electronics (CE) products, consumer technology is traveling easily between work and home.  Entertainment products are expected to be smarter and multi-functional such as a video multimedia system for the car that gives drivers navigation directions and links them to the Internet.  At the same time, products traditionally considered business-only now are designed to entertain as well as enhance productivity, such as a hand-held PC that offers full-color streaming video. The blending of environments-convergence-is the heart of workstyle and lifestyle technology at CES.   <P>
"Workstyle products, one of main highlights at CES, give consumers a range of benefits, including convenience and the ability to access information and increase personal productivity while on the go. Wireless phones, palm-tops, notebook computers, mobile Internet access devices, digital cameras and other products allow consumers to work when and where they want," commented Robbi Lycett, CES vice president. <P>
