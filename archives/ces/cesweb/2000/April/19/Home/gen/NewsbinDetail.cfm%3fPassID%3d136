	<font size="-1"><b>Vice Chairman of Global Crossing Emphasizes Need For Versatilty in the Networked Future
</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 9 2000
	<BR>
	Today, during a luncheon "Executive Briefing" at the 2000 International CES, Joseph Clayton, vice chairman of Global Crossing, stressed the importance of innovation in the immediate and long-term future success of consumer electronics companies. <p> Clayton, a 27-year veteran of the consumer electronics industry and former chairman of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (now named the Consumer Electronics Association), used examples of industrial giants such as Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan to demonstrate how innovative, versatile individuals and companies have achieved success. <p> According to Clayton, the need for such innovation is more important than ever, as consumers' evolving demand for just-in-time, instant gratification push us further into a networked society.   "Plan to be surprised," warned Clayton.  "The consumer is interested in new products, particularly digital." <p> Clayton continued by forecasting that over the course of the next decade, the growth of fiber optics networks to connect these new digital machines will be huge.  Taking aim at critics of the cable industry, he stated "there will be no glut, only ever increasing bandwidth requirements," and added that one of the most significant contributors to those requirements will be high-definition television. <p> Clayton's remarks were especially relevant to the audience of CES attendees who are just completing four days of viewing the latest in digital audio and video entertainment, including a wide variety of high-definition television products.  More than 1,500 exhibitors are showcasing the latest in workstyle and lifestyle technologies to more than 90,000 industry professionals here at CES. <p> For more news on CES, return to www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.
