	<font size="-1"><b>Chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems Outlines the Networked Future</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 7 2000
	<BR>
	During yesterday afternoon's Executive Perspective Keynote at the 2000 International CES, Sun Microsystems' Chairman and CEO, Scott McNealy, outlined his vision of the networked future, in which stand-alone electronic devices give way to a fully connected universe.  In this scenario, electronics devices not only work, but also work better.  McNealy stated that stand-alone devices would soon be obsolete because current electronics devices cannot connect with each other, let alone human beings. <P>
 McNealy's comments were especially relevant to the CES audience, many of whom had spent the day touring the show floor stocked with just such devices, including a wide variety of integrated home systems and home networking technologies.  More than 1,500 exhibitors are showcasing the latest in workstyle and lifestyle technologies to more than 90,000 industry professionals here at CES. <P>
 To set the mood, the presentation opened with a brief skit in which a frustrated man attempts to return numerous holiday gifts to a retailer because of their lack of connectivity.  A coffee-pot, for example, is unacceptable because it cannot recognize that the man has set his alarm clock earlier than usual, and so his coffee is not ready when he wakes.  McNealy used examples like these to demonstrate the trend towards a more connected future, in which consumer electronics devices are able to "talk" to each other, and as such perform better.  The language these devices will use, he proposed, is Sun Microsystem's JAVA and JINI technologies. <P>
 Taking his proposition even further, McNealy proposed that the trend towards connectivity would eventually lead to devices themselves being free to consumers.  Instead of paying for products, consumers would pay for the service (or usage of those products) through a third party service provider who, in essence, would lease the device to the consumer.  Through this model, products would become more customized to consumers' needs.  <P>
 To demonstrate his and his company's dedication to the concept, McNealy announced the formation of the "connected family," a unique business partnership between Sun, GTE, Cisco, and various device and content providers.  In the "connected family," Cisco will provide the network infrastructure, GTE will be the service provider, and Sun's JAVA/JINI will be the language that the various devices use to "talk" to one another.  A number of home products were demonstrated, including a refrigerator that automatically keeps track of grocery lists and a dishwasher that self-reports operational problems. <P>
 McNealy's closing remarks were words of advice to the audience.  He recommended that anyone providing a product, service or content would be well served to make that product, service or content either Web-based, or Web-ready, because if they don't, someone else soon would.  However, he also added that in this scenario, to survive, "you don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun all of the other hikers." <P>
 CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing. CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels. <P>
 As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support. As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
