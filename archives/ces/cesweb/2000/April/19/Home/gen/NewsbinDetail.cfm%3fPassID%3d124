	<font size="-1"><b>One Billion Wireless Users Projected by 2003</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 7 2000
	<BR>
	Wireless technology fueled by the Internet and increasing consumer demand for many forms of data will have dramatic growth in the U.S. in the coming years, according to the Wireless Supersession industry panel at the 2000 International CES - Your Source  for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology yesterday. According to the panelists, there will be one billion wireless users by 2003 and as many as 400 million using wireless devices to access the Internet by 2004. <P>
 The panelists, six corporate executives and an industry analyst, said wireless devices would perform a wide range of functions including peer-to-peer communications, digital chats, enterprise mail, brokerage and banking transactions as well as paging and voice communication. Opinions differed on exactly what devices would be necessary to deliver the wide range of services. <P>
 "I do not believe all of this can be stuffed into any one telephone," said Bill Lenahan of Bell South Wireless Data Services.  "People will have to carry two devices." <P>
 Mark Lowenstein, a Yankee Group analyst, predicted that the industry will become increasingly innovative with hardware.  One device will be a telephone.  The other will be a personal digital assistant or, perhaps, a "mobile  companion."  Lowenstein added, "CES is going to take center stage for hardware for wireless."  Indeed, many believe this wireless explosion is already developing. <P>
 The 2000 CES wireless product area features a host of advanced technologies from many of the world's leading manufacturers including Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and others.  Wireless products at the show range from telephones and pagers to hand-held GPS receivers and wireless Internet devices. <P>
 Panelist Bo Dimert of Ericsson predicted that disparate mobile communications hardware in the near future will be capable of seamless communications.  There will be, he predicted, equipment - a phone, a headset, a printer, a keyboard, etc. - that all work together but are connected without wires. <P>
 Bluetooth, the standard that permits the networking and integration of arbitrary devices, is being demonstrated at the 2000 International CES.  The underlying technology is based on low-cost, short-range radio links among devices, and the Bluetooth compatibility standard is gaining acceptability among hardware companies and momentum in the world of software. <P>
 Panelists noted that wireless communications products soon will be imbedded into appliances to facilitate remote maintenance and monitoring; that wireless equipment could be woven into clothes and worn and could replace cameras, credit cards and wireline telephones. <P>
 In fact, Roxanne Jozwick of AT&T Wireless noted that there are more mobile than wireline phones in Finland and suggested that a growing number of Americans are relying on wireless systems as their primary telephone service.  She noted that some Internet users are turning to wireless access instead of waiting for digital subscriber line (DSL) service. <P>
 In contrast to the majority of the panel's predictions of more sophisticated wireless services, one panelist, Sue Swenson of Leap Wireless International, made the case for a more basic approach.  Swenson explained that 30 percent of Americans have wireless phones and asked, "what about the other 70 percent?"  Among that group, she said, is a substantial market for basic limited voice service. <P>
 Wireless technology discussions are included in the 11 conference tracks and 130 conference sessions offered at the 2000 International CES.  In addition to wireless and mobile electronic communications, the show includes tracks on emerging technologies, lifestyle technology, e-commerce, retail management, specialty audio and workstyle technology.  Digital Hollywood and the Habitech Institute provide an array of sessions on home theater, integrated home systems and digital entertainment. <P>
 CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels. <P>
 As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology.  <P>
