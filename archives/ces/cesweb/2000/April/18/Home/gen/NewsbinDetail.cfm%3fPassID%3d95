	<p>Arlington, VA - Dec, 29 1999
	<BR>
	With more than 110,000 digital television (DTV) sets sold to consumers in just a few months, DTV is well on its way to becoming a mainstream item in American homes.  This year's 2000 International CES, January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nev., is the place to experience all the DTV products and the hottest DTV programming available.  Plus, for the first time, CBS will feed its daily prime-time programming to more than 90,000 people attending the 2000 International CES. <P>
"DTVs are selling at a brisk pace, and with the advent of more and more programming, we expect to see DTV product sales really leap-frogging in the next year," said Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) President and CEO Gary Shapiro.  "We are very excited about consumer reaction and acceptance of this new technology, and we know retailers, who haven't been able to keep DTV products in stock, are excited about seeing the next generation of DTVs at our show." <P>
The exhibit floor is filled with DTV displays.  Manufacturers including Creative Labs, Daewoo, Digitra Systems, Displaytech, Echostar/DISH Network, Fujitsu General America, Hughes, JVC, Konka, Motorola, Panasonic, Philips, Pioneer, Samsung, Sanyo Fisher, Sarnoff, Sony , Sharp, Sunho Corp., TeleCruz, TeraLogic, Toshiba, Thomson, Yamaha and Zenith are exhibiting the next generation of DTV products at CES.  Attendees can see integrated sets, set-top and converter boxes and DTV-capable displays.   <P>
The DTV exhibits are tuned in every day, all day, to live, over-the air, high definition broadcast feeds from CBS-affiliate KLAS-TV, and live, daily CBS primetime programming.  Additionally, PBS, an in-house movie channel and CES Today will be broadcast in HDTV for attendees' viewing.  More than 30 monitors throughout CES will display this range of HDTV programming. <P>
Attendees also can hear about delivery plans for the next generation of DTV products through several DTV conference sessions at CES and by visiting the DTV Information Center in the Grand Lobby of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC).  Included in the DTV-related sessions are: <P>
 Copy Protection for Digital Television: A Status Report <P>

CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
