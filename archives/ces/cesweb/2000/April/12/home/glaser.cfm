CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro welcomed the audience to the second day of CES. He said that today's focus will be on the Internet.  In introducing the keynote speaker, Rob Glaser, he said that five years ago few would have anticipated the driving force the Internet has become. 
<p>
The visions of Rob Glaser and RealNetworks have forever changed media delivery for the Internet and given consumers another tool to receive direct, immediate, live presentations and information. 
RealNetworks develops and markets software products and services designed to enable users of personal computers and other consumer electronic devices to send and receive audio, video and other multimedia services using the Web. 
<p>
Incorporated in 1994 as Progressive Networks by Glaser, RealNetworks released its first Realplayer in 1995 and now has more than 74 million registered users with more than 175,000 downloads per day.
Shapiro noted that Glaser had been an executive at Microsoft. Additionally, he serves on a Presidential Advisory Committee.
<p>
Glaser said he was honored to be there, adding that he had been attending CES for the past 15 years.
He demonstrated for the audience a watch that played music - and noted that convergence seemed to be the key word these days. He said when he first joined Microsoft in 1983, he worked on the Microsoft Flight Simulator-which he demonstrated to the audience - stating this was an example of 15-year-old technology. The PC came out in 1981, but the multimedia PC standard came later. In 1993, he downloaded a piece of software called "Mosaic." Since that time, he has seen the medium flourish beyond his wildest dreams. 
The early Internet was narrowband, but, by and large, it was a durable infrastructure setting the pace for rich media.
<p>
RealVideo was introduced in 1997. It had its glitches, but as they say, was "good enough to criticize." He said their RealJukebox system lit another fire to drive the industry forward. He stated that they had ended 1999 by adding more users than ever before in their history.  Media delivery is becoming a central part of the Internet, and there is a vast array of choices.
<p>
ABC recently aired its 24 hour Y2K coverage which allowed people worldwide to see coverage on the Internet as well as television.  There is a huge amount of information  to which people now can have access to. The computer also stores and remembers their preferences. This puts power and control back into the hands of the individual. Access to broadband is now increasing. Broadband is now riding the wave that narrowband rode in the early 90's.  The next chapter will be about digital entertainment beyond the PC. 
<p>
Next, RealNetwork's Vice President of Consumer Products Dan Richardson joined Glaser to talk about entertainment meeting the PC.  People are quickly building their home musical collections from their own CDs and other sources. He said RealJukebox allows a person to collect music from the Internet, organize it and personalize his or her experience. Fifty million CDs have been put on people's hard drives. 
Recently, the company has partnered with Adaptec to create another seamless experience. They also are going to be supporting a number of Sony devices with RealJukebox. Iomega also will enter into a partnership with the company to enable people to move music easily from home to work. He demonstrated by opening music on RealJukebox Plus and moving it from the PC to a zip disk. Next, it was playing on a portable Walkman.
<p>
He stated that the PC will fast become the entertainment hub with these available added devices, such as RealJukebox.  Next, he demonstrated the Liberate System, where the world can watch television and next shift to the Web. He said he feels that digital home entertainment will gain fusion with RealJukebox and Liberate. Next, the Take5 system was demonstrated - combining video and audio.
<p>
Glaser said they have worked closely with the music industry-while streaming technology moved from audio to include visual. Seagram's Universal Music, along with Real.Com, have united in a "watershed" effort.  Basically, they can take the music and connect it back to the artist-for the consumer's benefit. 
He said he sees digital entertainment for film and music, as they come together, having a transcending impact on the industry. 
<p>
He ended by thanking everyone for attending.
