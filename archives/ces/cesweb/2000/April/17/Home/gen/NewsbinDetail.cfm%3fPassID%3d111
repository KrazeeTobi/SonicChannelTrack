	<font size="-1"><b>CEA Inaugurates Top 50 Innovators to the CE Hall of Fame</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, Nev. - Jan, 6 2000
	<BR>
	To recognize the contributions of the  true pioneers of the consumer electronics industry, the Consumer Electronics  Association (CEA) announced the first 50 inductees into its Consumer  Electronics Hall of Fame today. Photographs and short profiles of each inductee are on display at several  locations in the Las Vegas Convention Center and Sands Exposition and  Convention Center during the 2000 International CES held here January 6-9.   Videotape segments displaying the inductees will be shown at today’s opening  keynote address. “This is one of the rare occasions that the industry gets to commemorate the  technological advancements it has provided and the far-reaching impact these  achievements have had in the lives of consumers worldwide.  It presents us  with the opportunity to reflect back on the accomplishments of our industry  and pay tribute to those individuals who have paved the way for today’s  workstyle and lifestyle products,” said Gary Shapiro, CEA president.   “Individually, and in some cases, together they made significant  contributions to the development of all consumer electronics products.   Without their creations, the world would be a very different place.” <P>
 A panel comprised of 11 media and industry professionals judged nominations  for the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.
