	<font size="-1"><b>Bill Gates of Microsoft to Present New Millennium Keynote at CES</b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Jul, 19 1999
	<BR>
	The International CES announced William H. Gates, III, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., will deliver the New Millennium Keynote address at its 2000 show.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology<sup>SM</sup> will be held January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nev.  <P>
The leading worldwide provider of software for the personal computer, Microsoft had revenues of $14.5 billion for the fiscal year ending June 1998, and employs more than 27,000 people in 58 countries. Under Gates  leadership, Microsoft s mission is to continually advance and improve software technology and to make it easier, more cost-effective and more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a long-term view, reflected in its investment of more than $3 billion on research and development in the current fiscal year. <P>
 We are thrilled to have Bill Gates, one of the most widely regarded visionaries in the consumer technology industry, speak at our 2000 show,  said Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), the sponsor, manager and producer of CES.  Microsoft s software is one of the key technology platforms showcased in hundreds of products at CES from lifestyle products such as WebTV to workstyle products such as Windows CE palmtops.  Microsoft software and other technologies demonstrated at CES are changing the way consumers work, live and play.  <P>
In 1999, Gates wrote <i>Business @ the Speed of Thought</i>, a book that shows how digital processes can solve business problems in fundamentally new ways.  Co-authored by Collins Hemingway, the book was published in 25 languages and is available in more than 60 countries. <i>Business @ the Speed of Thought</i> has received wide critical acclaim and was listed on the best-seller lists of the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, <i>the Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Amazon.com</i>.  Gates  previous book, <i>The Road Ahead</i>, published in 1995, held the No. 1 spot on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list for seven weeks.  <P>
In addition to his passion for computers, Gates is interested in biotechnology. He sits on the board of the Icos Corp. and is a shareholder in Darwin Molecular, a subsidiary of British-based Chiroscience. He also founded Corbis Corp., which is developing one of the largest resources of visual information in the world a comprehensive digital archive of art and photography from public and private collections around the globe. Gates also has invested with cellular telephone pioneer Craig McCaw in Teledesic, a company that is working on an ambitious plan to launch hundreds of low-orbit satellites around the globe to provide worldwide two-way broadband telecommunications service. <P>
In the decade since Microsoft has gone public, Gates has donated more than $270 million to charities, including $200 million to the William H. Gates Foundation. The focus of Gates  giving is in three areas: education, population issues and access to technology.  <P>
Gates will deliver his speech Wednesday, January 5, 2000, the night before CES officially opens, from 7:00 - 8:00 p.m. in the Las Vegas Hilton Theater.   <P>
CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
CEMA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  The 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology.  <P>
