	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 6 2000
	<BR>
	The 2000 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology today honored the industry's past, and presented a vision of a dynamic networked future in speeches at the show's opening keynote session. Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), CEA Chairman Darrell Issa and Eric Benhamou, chairman and CEO of 3Com, addressed a capacity crowd during the morning session. Shapiro said this year's International CES, the world's largest annual technology tradeshow, is honoring "50 people who can truly be called the pioneers of the consumer electronics industry." <P>
The 50 inductees into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame "paved the way for today's workstyle and lifestyle products,"  Shapiro said.  "The consumer electronics industry has evolved from a hardware business to a consumer technology industry that combines hardware, content and services."  Digital technologies are the "driving force" in the change, he added. <P>
Shapiro said sales of digital products totaled $30 billion in 1999 and are expected to reach $38 billion this  year.  DVD, home satellite, DTV and digital audio all enjoyed consumer acceptance. "In the next five years," he predicted, "our newly focused industry will generate more products in more configurations and combinations than in the entire history of the consumer electronics business." Issa agreed, and praised the industry for "a record-setting year in bringing new products at affordable prices to market." <P>
Benhamou said current and planned consumer electronics products would enable people to lead "more connected lives," and added that connectivity in the home was the "next frontier." Benhamou said the connected home would use wireless networks for internal interconnectivity, and broadband channels to link with the outside world.  He demonstrated video conferencing, wireless connections and new models of Internet-enabled telephones. <P>
The multitude of networked products, he concluded, will "bring improvements in the quality of lives."  <P>
Benhamou is one of four industry visionaries to present CES keynote addresses.  Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates gave the New Millennium Keynote last night.  Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems will present the Executive Perspective Keynote today at 4:00, and Rob Glaser, chairman and CEO of RealNetworks Inc., will deliver the Technology Keynote tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. <P>
Special CES sessions include presentations by Joseph Clayton, vice chairman of Global Crossing, Federal Communications Commission Chairman William E. Kennard, and Virginia Governor James Gilmore.  CES also will offer more than 130 conference sessions on the newest trends, strategies and profit opportunities in the consumer electronics industry. <P>
To showcase the products that will enable the connected world that Benhamou described, CES features a full range of workstyle and lifestyle technologies.  Included on the show floor are home networking, integrated home systems, computers and information technology, telecommunications, digital products, content providers and e-commerce offerings. <P>
"As Eric Benhamou explained, interconnection will come from the harmonious deployment of many technologies," Shapiro said.  "CES is the only show that brings all of those technologies together." <P>
CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
 As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
