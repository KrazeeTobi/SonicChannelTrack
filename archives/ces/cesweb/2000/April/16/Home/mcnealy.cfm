CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro welcomed Sun Microsystems Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy saying information technology and home networking are vital components of CES, and Sun Microsystems has been an innovator in both.
<p>
 	Scott McNealy's global company offers end-to-end solutions for doing business in the network age. With its platform-independent Java and Jini technologies, Sun provides high-speed microprocessors, scalable systems, robust software, network storage, mission-critical support and comprehensive professional services --all the key components that drive the Internet as well as corporate intranets and business-to-business extranets. 
<p>
McNealy said that the 18-year-old Sun Microsystems is well known for pushing the envelope in a .com world and now has revenues topping $12 billion. He has always been willing to share his ideas…and hopes today to leave them laughing and thinking and wanting more from technology and him.
<p>
An onstage skit took place at the "Customer Return Desk" where a customer attempted to return his outdated electronic items. McNealy took down the sign "Customer Returns" and hung a new sign saying "Simply Connect." The only way to accomplish this, he said, is to have everything speak the same language.  He said they have thought about this fact at Sun.  "If you walk out there on the floor, you will notice that the world has more things than people. The average home has 50 CPUs. The real Internet opportunity before us is networking things. That is the big challenge. They all have different operating systems and they need to talk. The computer industry is behind in this area. The industry has lost the focus on simplicity and reliability."

</td></tr></table><BR>




<p>
McNealy said it is his hope to automate the kitchen.  He finds that when he says, "Honey, I'm Hungry," it just simply doesn't work because he and his wife have three young children. 
<p>
He provided tips for the audience - on how tell when you have the wrong technology for your home:
<ul>
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	You open the refrigerator and the furnace reboots.
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	The memory on your phone only allows you to have three friends.
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	Your TV only gets MSNBC.
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	You press the status bar and three minutes later the Dominos Pizza man shows up.
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	Your mother-in-law shows up, and your doorbell works.
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	Your house is new, but your windows are broken.
<font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><li>
	Your radio is stuck on the 24-hour All-Yanni station.  
</ul>

McNealy emphasized that Sun's vision is to see every woman, man and child connected with a real broadband connector. "In 1996, we said anyone, anytime, anywhere, and now in 2000, Microsoft is saying that same thing, and they will probably try and trademark it!
<p>
"From a technology perspective, we need new architecture. Most of the technology is too fat for current uses. It doesn't work. Let's develop some technology that does work. Sensors can be helpful. We can download information and data on race cars, check our tires, or monitor a day care center. I'd want to see a smart card in the dashboard of every car---so when my teenager is driving, I will get a call telling him just how far over the speed limit he is going. Next, it will dial my son for him so I can tell him to slow down."
<p>
He reminded them they do not have to buy Office 2000 because Linux is free. Software is going to free. It's all going to be free.  He sees $1.1 billion month flowing into the Silicon Valley for this purpose.  "Soon, you will sell an appliance as a subscription or have it offered on an annual fee. Things are changing rapidly. How did you used to get food? You used to club food, or hunt and gather. Then we got carts and supermarkets. Now, we go to the Web. 
<p>
"GE is currently supplying power by the hour for jet engines. American Airlines uses GE because American Airlines is in the service business, not the jet engine business.  
<p>
"Smart cards can run Java applications. There is one common language. We now have Java devices showing up in everything. Jini allows these devices to connect. We try for consistency. Jini can rectify the problems in plug-and-work technology. We have 20,000 licensees for Jini now. We are not going to have Windows in everything."
<p>
Next, McNealy demonstrated lightweight phones that utilize Java, but are not available in the U.S. He showed a cell phone from Motorola that featured Java games.  He showed a Sony camera with Java technology that is capable of editing film, right on the spot. And, he demonstrated two-way e-mail on a pager, saying they also run on Java and have Instant Messaging. There are no viruses in Java. 
<p>
Next, assistants moved on stage to a Bosch dishwasher and a Whirlpool refrigerator, and scanned through all of the services of a "connected home." 
<p>
"All these devices are managed from a central system-making it simpler for the consumer and the manufacturer. Everything from recipes to a shopping list can be contained on this system. You might take a scanner and scan the barcode of a food item, and add it to your shopping list. And, because you are connected, you simply send your list to Streamline.com and have it show up on your doorstep. In the connected home, you can convert your home-using a Web phone. Broadband networks are not perfected yet, but within the next 10 years, they will be the order of the day."
<p>
McNealy announced the Connected Family - Sun, GTE, Sisco, Bosch, Sears, Streamline, and more. 
"This concept came up after they asked themselves, 'what can we do for residential people?'  How can we provide solutions to the residential marketplace?
<p>
This concept will allow the consumer to access their home from wherever they are. They will still require an infrastructure to make these things happen effortlessly for the consumer."
McNealy said it's an exciting new world they are headed into - one where all the services will have to be Web ready.
<p>
Pat Soltz from Sun's Software Products Group came on stage to moderate a panel. Representatives from the various companies were on hand to answer questions.
