Eric Benhamou was introduced by CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro. Benhamou has been with 3Com since 1990 and has seen it become a Fortune 300 company as well as a part of the President's Technology Information Advisory Committee. The focus of Benhamou's message was a more connected life in the new millennium:
<p>
We are meeting here at CES only a few days into the New Year and at the dawn of a brand new millenium:
 	We will  be taking lessons from the past to help prepare for the future,   reviewing  lists of facts, people and events.  I feel that beginnings are always auspicious times for hope.
<p>
 	The economy is humming and productivity is high.  In general, we are living in a period of unprecedented prosperity.  The Internet has brought us a new economic order.  It has caused fundamental changes in our lifestyle-a more connected life.   We are more connected to our colleagues at work, our friends and family,  and  to sources of information in general.
<p>
 	Nokia, a company which prides itself on connecting people, has predicted there will be more than one billion cell phones in use around the world shortly. Consumer electronic devices will be made more personal.  3Com creates these connections.   We are  intent on providing the infrastructure that helps facilitate a "more connected lifestyle."
<p>
Our company is only 20 years old and we now have $6 billion in revenues and 13,000 people making up our community.  By now, we have made over 300 million connections all over the world.  It took us 10 years to make the first million connections - and the rest have occurred since.  We will be dealing in billions of connections in the near future.  
<p>
We all have to think on a larger scale for the next frontier:  the home.  The obstacles to overcome will be the requirement of simplicity and the need for reliability.    The nature of connections is changing and becoming more intelligent.   There is a strong desire for access to smart technology.  We live in the world of E.   You need an E-network.  This is who we are and what we do.
<p>
Our theme, "More Connected to :Lifestyle," can be examined by introducing you to a typical family.  They are middle class and they utilize technology in their every day lifestyles. 
<p>
The following describes the family and how they put technology to work for them:
<p>
Mark, the father, works from home and also has the primary job of caring for the family.<br>
Jane, the mother, works in a business that calls for her to travel.  She frequently goes on business trips.<br>
Judy, 16, the daughter, aspires to be an anthropologist.<br>
Anthony, age 12, the son, is a seventh grader.<br>
Max, the dog, is a five-year-old lab who favors chasing the mailman.
<p>
A typical day: The day starts at 6:00am.  At 6:15am, Mark and Jane synchronize their palm pilots to find out about each other's schedules.  At 6:30am, Jane wakes up the children and braces for a busy day in the office, plus leaving later on that day for a trip to Los Angeles.
<p>
Their  home is connected to the Internet using broadband.  This is a key enabler of home networking.  Two million households are connected to broadband networks.  
<p>
Broadband provides a rich set of services, including video.  Different family members utilize broadband for different reasons - shopping, reviewing stock portfolios or downloading the latest music.  Inside the home is a home network that doesn't use any special wiring.  You can do simple things using standard phone lines-simplicity is the key.
<p>
You also can go to a kiosk in an airport and type in your home phone number and the computer will assist you and tell you how your home can most readily be accessed.  
<p>
Just last fall, 3Com introduced a home network which operates using only existing phone lines.
Back to the story, it is now around 7:00am, and Mark begins working.  He starts the day  checking his stock portfolio.  He also plans for the family dinner that evening.  
<p>
Judy can be found online doing color coordination of clothing to be worn that day by her and her friends.  She next downloads music. All of these activities are carried out simultaneously-convergence  is taking place on the same broadband  connection. 
<p>
Now, it is 7:30am, and Anthony doesn't feel well and comes downstairs.  Mark determines that his son is sick and calls the family doctor for an Internet appointment.  He sends Anthony back to bed and goes about his business.  It is now 9:30 and he calls the doctor across a video conferencing line-and the doctor performs a video conferencing exam. Looking through the video camera, the doctor determines  that Anthony has the chickenpox!  Anthony will have to spend the rest of the week in bed.
<p>
This is a simple video conference-a home connect video camera that anyone can use was demonstrated.  A connection was opened and a video conference demonstration ensued. 
<p>

<p>
Wireless networks are a key ingredient in a more connected lifestyle.
There is another wireless technology known as "Bluetooth."  Bluetooth is named for a ninth century Danish king famous for uniting warring factions.  
<p>
This is a type of network that could be used to unite pagers, Palm Pilots, telephones and more, utilizing the Bluetooth link.   
<p>
These devices recognize each other, synchronize and are simple to use. Special purpose devices will be seen more often, especially within the home environment. 
<p>
How do these special purpose devices integrate themselves into the lifestyle of our family?  Jane, at work and leaving for the airport, checks her palm device and checks that her flight is on time.  Next, she checks her e-mail.  Then, she checks with Mark only to find out that Anthony is ill, and of course, feels guilty.  She makes it to the airport by 4:30pm.
<p>
Next, she walks into her Los Angeles office and beams her Palm Pilot at a co-worker's phone.  The phone is now transformed into  a full Internet appliance.  
<p>
Benhamou introduces a 3Com General Manager who goes into more detail on the Internet appliances.   He uses his cell phone to demonstrate how a phone can be used as an Internet appliance.  
<p>
Benhamou next demonstrated the "click and dial" capabilities--unregistering from the one phone and directing his calls to his home phone, and then changing it to access the Internet.  He explained:
Phones are now in lab trials and will go into field trials this coming spring.  They should be on the market shortly after that. This technology is anticipated to change the industry game and constitutes a deregulation in the technology industry. 3Com is extremely excited about the Internet appliances which will represent a true "breakthrough" in the consumer market and everyday life.
<p>
It will be possible for appliances such as stoves, refrigerators, toasters, etc. to have their maintenance managed remotely by the owner, or by the people providing the maintenance services.  Home technology as part of the family's everyday life is currently being featured by 3Com during  CES.  The aim is to help people achieve more connected lives.
<p>
The next example of incorporating technology into family life was shown in a  video of a family spread throughout the world - while planning their upcoming  family reunion. They were able to coordinate everyone's travel schedules  and take care of  other details, including ordering the food and wine for the event.  The video showed that people can seamlessly incorporate this technology into typical  life events.
<p>
Benhamou said this can all be done with current off-the-shelf technology with the emphasis on simplicity and reliability!  We are  not quite there yet-there are still software crashes and time spent holding on the line, but we  have now survived Y2K, so we   are definitely on the way.
<p>
The impact of this more connected lifestyle is reflected in our daily activities and in society at large.  We actually will think differently as a result of this more connected lifestyle.   In addition, people are subjected to more information than ever before.
<p>
While we may have dealt with a scarcity of  facts in the past, we now are dealing with information that has reached the saturation point, in many cases.   The mind has to synthesize all this and not get lost.   We must combine the content and context with the maturity of our judgment.  
<p>
 	The young minds we want to shape in our schools are facing many changes in educational techniques and priorities.  We might be tempted to believe that just because we are so "well connected," that this is synonymous with having good relationships, but it is not.  The relationships must pre-exist before they can be enhanced with technology.  We live in communities - not necessarily "virtual communities."  While AOL and e-bay talk about communities, I am talking about geographic communities. 
In some communities, schools, fire departments, hospitals, etc. pool their resources for better E-service.  Children can apply for library cards online, while business people can apply for permits online, and others may have easy access to maps in the community.  He said this makes for a more efficient community.   For instance, the mayor and the superintendent of schools may have come together for this purpose, and it benefits society at large.  In this sense, the Internet can offer a sense of renewal.  
<p>
A digital divide exists today between the digital "haves" and"have-nots."  The Department of Commerce recently came out with a report entitled, "Falling through the Net."  There exists a division between white and non-white households.  While both groups recently have become more connected, the gap has not closed.  It does not seem to be a question of race, but rather, income levels.  It is hard to envision a harmonious society with these gaps existing.
<p>
President Clinton has encouraged community access centers for environmentally challenged areas, so that the gaps can close.    3Com also has initiated a coalition for the City of Boston to help with wiring classrooms.  The results have been quite remarkable.  There have been changes in curriculums as well as in training of teachers in connected environments.
<p>
3Com has also participated in the YWCA's "Connected Entrepreneurs'  Program," for business start-ups in economically challenged areas.  We anticipate some valuable mentorship from this source.  We are trying to do our part in closing this "digital divide" and contributing to a better quality of life.
Benhamou finished saying "this is a great industry…and I am happy for this opportunity to come together."
