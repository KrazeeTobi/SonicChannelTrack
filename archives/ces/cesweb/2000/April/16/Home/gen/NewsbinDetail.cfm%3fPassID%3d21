	<font size="-1"><b>New Award Honors Hottest Workstyle Products for 2000</b></font>

	<p>New York, NY - Aug, 19 1999
	<BR>
	The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) today announced the CES Workstyle Awards, honoring groundbreaking new products that allow professionals to work anywhere, 24 hours a day.  Winners will be announced at the 2000 International CES in Las Vegas, Nev., Jan. 6 to 9, 1999. <P>
To be eligible for the prestigious award, products must have exciting, innovative features that reflect today's emerging "Workstyle" trend enabling people to be productive wherever they need to work whether it's in an office building, on the road or at home.   	 "Workstyle products are changing the way people do business," said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president.  "Through this award, we hope to discover the best, most innovative products that keep technologically savvy professionals productive anytime, anywhere."	 <P>
Products can be entered into any of six Workstyle categories: notebook computers, wireless information and telecommunications devices, hand-held devices (PDAs), mobile/portable Internet access devices, hand-held navigational equipment and portable peripherals.  <P>
The contest is open to all CES exhibitors.  Products must be marketed in the United States and available at retail in the first half of 2000.  Products that pass a "first cut" review will be entered into final judging on the first day of CES.  A panel of celebrity and media judges will select winners based on usefulness, style, portability and functionality.  Winning products will be showcased in a secure kiosk in the grand lobby at CES. 	 To nominate a hot new product for a CES Workstyle Award, contact Cia Morey at (703) 907-7672 or e-mail: cmorey@eia.org for an application.  Entries are due by December 10, 1999. <P>
As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEMA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.    <P>
