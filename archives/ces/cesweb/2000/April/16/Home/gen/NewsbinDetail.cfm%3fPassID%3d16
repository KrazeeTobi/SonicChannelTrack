	<font size="-1"><b>Innovations 2000 Recognizes Technology Design and Engineering at CES</b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Aug, 4 1999
	<BR>
	Entries for Innovations 2000, the consumer technology design awards program sponsored by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) and endorsed by the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) and the Consumer Electronics Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), are due October 6, 1999.  This prestigious awards program is an opportunity for manufacturers and developers to have their products judged by a preeminent panel of journalists, designers and engineers, and have the winning products showcased at the 2000 International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, January 6-9, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nev. <P>
As the most widely renowned consumer technology awards program, Innovations recognizes the best designed and engineered products in the categories of accessibility, audio, blank media, computer hardware and software, electronic gaming, home data networking, integrated home systems, home appliances, home theater, online/Internet, mobile electronics, mobile office, personal electronics, photographic equipment, retail resource, satellite systems, small office/home office, specialty/high-end audio, telephones, video and wireless communications.  <P>
To qualify for the contest, entrants must exhibit at the 2000 International CES and manufacture products marketed in the United States.  <P>
In addition, the entry must fit within the product category in which it is being exhibited, be marketed at retail outlets and be commercially available to consumers no later than the first quarter of 2000.  <P>
Product evaluations are based on weighted criteria, including value to users, aesthetics, contributions to the quality of life, the product's innovative qualities and overall excellence. Last year there were more than 500 entries, with more than 20 in the digital television-related category alone.  <P>
The contest's winning products will be on display at the Sands Expo and Convention Center, and the "Best of Showcase" entries-the best of the best-also will appear in the Grand Lobby of the Las Vegas Convention Center.  Honoree plaques also will be on display in the winners' booths, giving these companies industry-wide recognition as leaders in their fields. The award winners are entitled to use the Innovations 2000 logo on all packaging and advertising to identify their company as having achieved excellence in product design. Other perks of the award include listings in the CES Show Directory, the Innovations 2000 Directory and on the CES Web site.   <P>
The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing. CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.  <P>
As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEMA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.   <P>
