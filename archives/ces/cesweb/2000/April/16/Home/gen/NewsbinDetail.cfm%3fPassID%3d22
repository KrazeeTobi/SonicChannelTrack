	<font size="-1"><b>CES and Alexis Park Resort - The High-End Audio Event of the Year</b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Sep, 1 1999
	<BR>
	The Alexis Park Resort high-end audio exhibition at the 2000 International CES promises to be the high-end audio event of the year.  The Alexis Park will be filled with entrepreneurial spirit as hundreds of audio exhibitors showcase technologies for the new millennium. <P>
More than 13,000 attendees are expected to visit the Alexis Park exhibit January 6-9 in Las Vegas, NV, when the high-end audio industry gathers for its key trade event of the year.  The Alexis Park Resort exhibit is held at an independent location from the main CES exhibition to provide high-end audio manufacturers their own unified venue.  At the same time, exhibitors have quick access to the main CES venues, which are only five minutes by CES shuttle buses from the Alexis Park Resort, at the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. <P>
"Attendees of the Alexis Park Resort exhibits are accustomed to forging the relationships that form key strategic partnerships," said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president.  "The 2000 International CES event is expected to be even more robust than normal.  In addition to the usual networking, industry executives can expect high attendee levels, industry-wide presence and dynamic press coverage.  CES management has committed extra marketing dollars for exhibitors as well as upgraded facilities." <P>
The Alexis Park Resort will have new added features in 2000 to further benefit exhibitors.  The Resort has upgraded, remodeled and enlarged its suites to better benefit exhibitors.  Additionally, free shuttle buses will run to the Alexis Park from other CES venues every 10 minutes.   <P>
Industry leaders like Thiel, Martin Logan and Conrad-Johnson are just three of more than 400 high-end audio exhibitors at Alexis Park.  Gary Warzin, president of Audiophile Systems, commented on the venue, stating, "In the 25 years we have been in business, we have never found a show site more conducive to doing business than the Alexis Park."  Added Kathy Gornik, president of  Thiel Audio, "For us, the International CES is an indispensable part of our marketing sales strategy."   The Alexis Park Resort is also home to a unique set of conference sessions that encourages participation in town-hall style discussions surrounding the specialized audio industry.  The sessions, sponsored by the audio equipment Internet site, www.Audiocafe.com, feature five seminars focusing on the special high-end audio topics, including:  "Breaking the Traditional Retail Mold:  How to Sell Specialized Audio Successfully Online," "Increasing Awareness and Consumer Interest in High-Quality Multichannel Sound," "Music and Audio:  Separate or Equal, " "Everyone Loves Music.  So Why Don't They Love Specialty Audio," and "In an Age of Cultural Diversity, How Can the Specialized Audio Industry Market its Products More Successfully?" <P>
CES has also allocated substantial marketing resources to Alexis Park exhibitors.  In addition to several million dollars of comprehensive marketing designed to garner increased attendance, exhibitors benefit from complimentary Web presence, inclusion in the CES directory and limited free access to CES mail campaigns. <P>
CES is known as the trade networking event of the year.  Gilbert Yeung, president of Blue Circle Audio, stated, "Alexis Park has the environment where everybody in our industry can sit and talk, it's not just about good sound, it's also about having a place where you can feel comfortable."  <P>
Parties interested in either attending or exhibiting at the high-end audio exhibit at the Alexis Park Resort should visit the Web site, www.cesweb.org or call 703 907 7600. <P>
