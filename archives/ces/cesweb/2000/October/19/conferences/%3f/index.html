<!--For more than three decades, Intel has developed technology enabling the computer and 
Internet revolution that has changed the world. Founded in 1968 to build semiconductor memory 
products, Intel introduced the world's first microprocessor in 1971. Today, Intel supplies chips, 
boards, systems, software, networking and communications equipment, and services that compose the 
ingredients of computer architecture and the Internet.<p>

A building block supplier to the Internet economy, Intel's technology can be found in products and 
services throughout the CES exhibit floor and the industry worldwide. Through its technological 
advances, Intel has helped numerous companies innovate new ways to enhance consumers' workstyles 
and lifestyles.  By distributing its home networking technology through consumer channels, Intel 
also exemplifies the traditional IT (information technology) companies that increasingly are 
joining the consumer technology realm.<p>Barrett serves on the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st 
Century, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and authored the university textbook <i>Principles of Engineering Materials</i>.-->

Barrett joined Intel in 1974 as a technology development manager and later became president in 
1997 and CEO in 1998. After receiving his Bachelor of Science, Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees 
in Materials Science from Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., he joined the faculty of 
Stanford University and remained there until he joined Intel.<p>
