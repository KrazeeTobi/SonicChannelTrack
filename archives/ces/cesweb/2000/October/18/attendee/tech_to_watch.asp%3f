<font class="subhead2">Digital Radio</a></font><p>

With the introduction of two new digital technologies in 2001, American consumers soon will 
have a multitude of digital audio choices available in their cars. Expect receivers for digital 
satellite radio and digital terrestrial radio to start trickling into the U.S. marketplace in 2001. 
And if the business plans of three companies come true, the analog radio sound that has been with 
us since Pittsburgh's KDKA was licensed in the 1920s will be just a fading, fizzing, popping dream.<p>

But consumers cannot hear the crystal clear reception of local AM and FM radio and the varied 
content of national satellite radio with today's radios. Get set for the radio receiver market to 
heat up.  The first generation of these receivers will debut at CES.<p>

In the satellite arena, two companies obtained spectrum from the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) in 1997 to provide satellite digital audio radio service (SDARS). Sirius Satellite 
Radio and XM Satellite Radio expect to each beam 100 channels of digital music and talk formats 
from the stars by mid-year 2001 for coast-to coast coverage.<p>

Meanwhile, iBiquity Digital is finalizing development on a technology that will allow earthbound 
stations the opportunity to go digital. The in-band, on-channel digital audio broadcasting (iDAB) 
technology allows radio stations to simulcast digital and analog signals on the same frequency. 
Stations are expected to begin adding digital to their signals in 2001 pending the resolution of 
certain technological and regulatory hurdles. <p>

<a href="http://www.ce.org/vision_magazine">November/December 
issue of Consumer Electronics Vision</a> with an article by Lynn 
Meadows (Due out by November 1).<p>

<font class="subhead2">Bluetooth</font><p>

With immense support across disparate industries, Bluetooth is becoming one of the favored 
global wireless technology standards. While other wireless technology groups such as IrDa and Home RF have fewer than 100 members each, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is comprised of close to 1,400 companies. Seldom does one see such cooperation among competitors and across disparate industries.<p>

Today its leadership Promoter Group has expanded beyond its initial founders; Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba to include 3Com, Lucent Technologies, Microsoft and Motorola. The SIG has become the leading force driving the rapid widespread acceptance of Bluetooth across the wide spectrum of telecommunications, computer hardware/software, automotive, military, medical and consumer electronics industries.<p>

The actual applications of Bluetooth-enabled wireless technology signal a revolutionary global change in workstyles and lifestyles. It's at the core of the promise of a robust wireless Internet, wireless electronic commerce devices, and 'gee whiz' devices yet to come.<p>

For further information on Bluetooth technology and its possible applications, <a href="http://www.ce.org/vision_magazine/editions/2000/mayjune/p13_15.asp">check out Consumer Electronics Vision magazine's article by Susan Schreiner</a>.<p>

<font class="subhead2">Digital Imaging</font><p>
If the old adage suggests a picture paints a thousand words, then the words evoked by the digital images being transmitted across computers today must number in the multi-billions, each personalized to the exact tenor and taste of their originator. <p>

A new and powerful army of product suites are making their way into consumers' hands that empower users to capture, view, edit, save and send images in ways that were quite simply out of reach only a year or two ago. These digital cameras and camcorders, expanded editing software packages and other facilitating technologies are melding in a rainbow of applications, ranging from e-mailing photos of the kids to grandma to breathing new life into old home movies to creating and editing digital movies that can "screen" on a variety of formats. <p>

According to the results of the Consumer Electronics Association's (CEA) "Digital Camera Owners Profile" survey, nearly 48 percent of owners claim the main reason for purchasing a digital camera was to post pictures to a website. <p>

In addition to posting photos, digital camera owners also engage in a variety of other activities that enhance the sharing of experiences. Eighty percent of owners declared having e-mailed a photo taken with a digital camera, 82 percent have printed a photo, and 26 percent viewed a photo on their TV. <p>

Ownership of a digital camera also correlates to an increase in photography. Fifty-eight percent of owners reported an increase in the total number of photos taken after the purchase of their digital camera. The typical owner takes approximately 37 pictures per month with their digital camera. Little difference was found to exist among gender, age or income segments when considering usage.<p>

CEA estimates that 2.7 million digital cameras will be sold in the United States this year, a 30 percent increase from 1999 sales.<p>

<font class="subhead">Home Networking</font><p>

More people are equipping their houses with a full range of networked systems that can control everything ranging from programming their alarm systems to setting up their heating and lighting to distributing television and Internet connections. <p>

The home networking industry has come a long way since the first remote controls and timers came onto the market about twenty years ago, and the industry has grown in scope to reflect this coming of age. <p>

Early home automation systems aimed to simplify our lives by automatically taking care of the mundane aspects of running a home, like turning lights on and off or putting appliances on a schedule. Integrated home systems (IHS) sought to link independent systems and appliances so they could work together and be controlled from other sources, so arming the security system could set back the thermostat for example. <p>

Home networking brings the power of distributed content to the home's automated and integrated systems. And the proliferation of digital technology in a multitude of devices promises to change the market even more dramatically.  Just as the personal computer revolutionized the way we communicate, the home networking market could be the next phase of technology that changes how we live. <p>
 
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) defines a home network as follows: a home network facilitates communication among the appliances, home systems, entertainment products and information devices in a home, so they can work cooperatively and share information. This allows users to get information about the home's condition and remotely control home systems and appliances, as well as provide access to information and entertainment resources outside the home. <p>

According to a CEA survey of 1000 consumers in April of this year, consumers share the industry's excitement about the future of networking digital products, as long as the information is immediately applicable to them. Entertainment content such as music and video are among the most popular types of content consumers would like distributed around the house earning 59 and 47 percent respectively.<p>

<font class="subhead2">MP3 and Internet Audio</font><p>
Last year MP3 took the country by storm. At the 2000 International CES, more than a dozen new MP3 players debuted.  MP3 technology offers consumers a new way to carry and receive free music off the Internet. MP3 technology is going to change the way music is sold and listened to forever. <p>

According to a Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) survey, 65 percent of multimedia PC households with Internet access have listened to a sound file from an Internet Web page and that number is growing daily. <p>

MP3 is an acronym for MPEG 3, which is itself an acronym for Motion Picture Expert Group-1, Audio Layer-3. MPEG defines digital video and audio data compression standards. Because they are open standards, nobody owns them, and they are available free or for a small fee. <p>

MP3 has become the commonly accepted term for one of the many compression algorithms, also known as codecs, available for downloading digital music files from the Internet. For example, MP3 can compress the size of a five-minute CD track from about 50 megabytes to five megabytes and the download time to your computer's hard drive from about two hours to ten minutes.<p>

CEA's Generation Y: Home Entertainment Market Overview found among the online segment of Gen Y (approximately 60 percent), 57 percent have played an MP3 music file. Although sound quality expectations vary, the data suggests that the majority of Gen Y listening to the MP3 format rate its sound quality as comparable to a typical stereo. <p>

In addition, the study shows that Gen Y is moving away from the traditional stereo system for listening to music. Approximately 14 percent of respondents claimed to use their PC more than a traditional stereo for listening to music. Another one in four claimed to use both with approximately the same frequency; meaning that nearly 40 percent of Generation Y is using the PC as much as or more than a stereo for listening to music. <p>
