<b>CES Gives You Access to the Leading Industry Visionaries</b><br>

Showcasing the growing workstyle, home networking and digital application trends in the consumer technology industry, the 2000 International CES features four leading pioneers as keynoters: Eric A. Benhamou, chairman and CEO of 3Com Corp.; Bill Gates, chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corp.; Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems; and Rob Glaser, chairman of RealNetworks.
<P>
<b>3Com Corp.</b><br>

Following the growing workstyle trend as technology allows consumers to work when and where they want, 3Com's products allow individuals and organizations worldwide to stay more connected by communicating and sharing information and resources at anytime, anywhere. With more than $5.4 billion in annual revenues, 3Com is the second largest networking company in the world, delivering end-to-end connectivity solutions to consumers, small businesses, enterprises and network service providers and carriers.   In 1981, Benhamou co-founded Bridge Communications, an early networking pioneer, and was vice president of engineering of that company until its merger with 3Com in 1987. He became the CEO of 3Com in 1990. 

<P><b>Microsoft</b><br>
Microsoft's Windows software is one of the key technology platforms showcased in hundreds of products at CES-from lifestyle products such as WebTV to workstyle products such as Windows CE palmtops. The leading worldwide provider of software for the personal computer, Microsoft had revenues of $14.5 billion for the fiscal year ending June 1998, and employs more than 27,000 people in 58 countries. Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft's mission is to continually advance and improve software technology and to make it easier, more cost-effective and more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a long-term view, reflected in its investment of more than $3 billion on research and development in the current fiscal year.
<P>
<b>Sun Microsystems</b><br>
Information technology and home networking are vital components of CES, and McNealy and Sun's software technology have been an innovative force in both areas. A $10 billion company with offices in 150 countries, Sun Microsystems provides end-to-end solutions for doing business in the network age. With its platform-independent Java and Jini technologies, Sun provides high-speed microprocessors, scalable systems, robust software, network storage, mission-critical support and comprehensive professional services-all the key components that drive the Internet as well as corporate intranets and business-to-business extranets.  Since becoming Sun's CEO in 1984, McNealy has steered the company to growth and profitability.  
<P>
<b>RealNetworks Inc.</b><BR>
RealNetworks is the recognized leader in media delivery for the Internet.  It develops and markets software products and services designed to enable users of personal computers and other consumer electronic devices to send and receive audio, video and other multimedia services using the Web. Incorporated in 1994 as Progressive Networks by Rob Glaser, RealNetworks released its first RealPlayer in 1995 and now has more than 74 million registered users with more than 175,000 downloads per day.  Glaser currently serves on several non-profit boards and recently was appointed by President Clinton to the Advisory Committee on Public Interest Obligations of Digital Television Broadcasters. Before founding RealNetworks, Glaser served as vice president of multimedia and consumer systems at Microsoft Corp. where he successfully pioneered new developments in multimedia, computer networking and desktop applications.
