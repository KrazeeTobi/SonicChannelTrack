<b><font size=+1>The next generation of television is here.</font></b> 1998 International CES represents the commercial debut of High Definition  Television. For the very first time, major TV manufacturers are introducing consumer HDTV's and announcing plans  to bring them to market during the fourth quarter of 1998. Show attendees can watch over-the-air HDTV feeds from experimental DTV stations at the facilities of KLAS-TV (CBS-affiliate) and KLVW-TV (PBS-affiliate). A third in-house feed will feature Rebo Group programming and productions. Soon, consumers will be able to bring home the many benefits of digital television and enjoy HDTV broadcasts right in their own living room.

<h2>Digital and HDTV Sets for Consumers</h2>
Digital and high-definition sets will be on retail shelves in the fourth quarter of this year. Consumers can finally realize the benefits of high-definition technology: Clear, crisp pictures, and CD-quality sound. Initially, most DTV's will be large screen sets. As with most new consumer technologies, the initial sets will be expensive. Some price estimates range from $2,000-5,000 over current set prices for comparable sizes.  Other estimates are as high as $8,000-10,000 for HDTV's. Prices will drop as demand increases and economies of scale are realized. Historically, the price of consumer electronics products drop 50% within 10 years of introduction.

<h2>A Long Life for Today's TVs</h2>
Traditional analog televisions will continue to receive broadcast signals until at least the year 2006, and probably longer. Once the switch to digital broadcasts is complete, today's televisions will be able to receive the new signals with the addition of a set-up converter box.  And, other technologies- like cable, VCRs, DVD, and home satellite- will continue to work with today's televisions for years to come.<P>

<h2>HDTV Broadcasts Coming Soon</h2>
<b>(via Broadcast, Cable, Satellites)</b><br>
Broadcasters have promised there will be at least one digital station in each of the top ten markets by November of 1998. Broadcasters are required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to transition to digital in the top ten markets (reaching 30% of U.S. households) by May 1999, and in the top 30 markets (reaching 50% of U.S. households) by November 1999.  Broadcasters will continue to carry traditional analog broadcasts until at least 2006, and probably longer.  In addition, cable operators, like HBO, have said they may have HDTV programming as early as this summer.

<h2>Steady Transition from Analog to Digital</h2>
Consumers want HDTV.  From black-and-white TV to color, from phonographs to CDs, from video tapes to DVD, there is proof the American consumer has never passed up the opportunity to take advantage of improved audio and video performance.  HDTV is no different.  Surveys of consumers who have seen the technology indicate an overwhelming interest in it's revolutionary picture and sound quality improvements and its potential for inter-activity (See CEMA/Verity HDTV consumer focus group research).  Currently, one in every four households buys a TV set each year- that's 25 million TV sets a year. And, 18 million of all U.S. households have paid $2,000 or more for their TV sets. With the average life of a TV at eight years,  many of these 18 million households will be ready to replace their analog sets with HDTVs in the first few years of introduction. Conservative market analysis predicts 30% of U.S households will have digital sets by 2006. All indications are that this technology will be a tremendous success.
