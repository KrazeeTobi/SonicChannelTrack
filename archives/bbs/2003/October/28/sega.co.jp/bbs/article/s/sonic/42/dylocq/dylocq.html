Why is SONICTEAM forgetting about the past Sonic? Even alot of people in USA agree with me that Sonic games these days are a bit lacking.<BR><BR>SONICTEAM forgot about...<BR><BR>Super Emeralds<BR>Hyper Forms.<BR>Buble Sheild<BR>Fire Sheild<BR>Level Design<BR>Music<BR><BR>I really want the Super Emeralds back. I mean, there was alot of Sonic games that had the Chaos Emeralds as their main storyline. How about having the Super Emeralds back? I think a Sonic game would be interesting if they had the Super Emeralds back.<BR><BR>Super Sonic is getting a bit old now. He seems to be dominating every opponent he sees. I think SONICTEAM should really bring up a STRONG enemy even Super Sonic can't even handle. And Hyper Sonic may give that enemy a challenge. If SONICTEAM really likes to surprise Sonic fans...I think Hyper Sonic needs to come back.<BR><BR>The buble and fire sheild is what I also miss. It made Sonic dominate in water, and enemys who use fire power. Since Sonic has the homing attack now, I don't think the extra double jump should not be in the shields anymore, but SONICTEAM should make a level when Sonic and his friends really need them.<BR><BR>Sonic stages are being a bit realistic now....especially Sonic Adventure 2, and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. If you look at the background design in City Escape...they really look realistic. I think SONICTEAM should make the stages like the 3D Green Hill Zone in Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. It fits into Sonic perfectly.<BR><BR>Now, the music. The music is bringing down Sonic alot. There are Sonic Fans who hate rap, and Rock and Roll, but I never heard a complaint about the Sega Genesis Sonic The Hedgehog's music. I really loved the music in the Sega Genesis days. I mean, who did not love the music "Flying Battery" in Sonic and Knuckles?<BR><BR><BR>I hope SONICTEAM goes back to old Sonic. It would really make Sonic The Hedgehog and his friends REALLY popular than ever. Alot of people in USA agree that Sonic these days, are a bit lacking. I do not know what Japanese people think about my opinion, but can you tell me if most of them agree with me?
