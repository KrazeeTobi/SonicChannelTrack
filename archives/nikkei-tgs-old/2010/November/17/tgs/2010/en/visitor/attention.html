<p>There are items that are strictly prohibited at the venue (see below). Keep your baggage as compact as possible so that the inspections will proceed smoothly. It is expected that those visitors with large amounts of baggage will have longer inspections (for example, those who plan to cosplay). Please arrive early to allow enough of time for this. In addition, with regard to pet bottles, we might check the contents inside.</p>
<p>We request for your understanding and cooperation to ensure the safe management of the venue.</p>
