<h4>Episode Map</h4>
<div class="cf">
<p class="pc">Episode Map</p>
<p>This is the basic game screen. Scoring points as you play allows you to progress across the map and deeper into the story.<br>
Various things happen at waypoints along the map—perhaps an event will take place, or maybe you'll earn some Rings or items.<br>
Reach the end of the map, and you might even find a familiar foe waiting for a showdown!</p>

<h4>Rankings</h4>
<div class="cf">
<p class="pc">Rankings</p>
<p>This screen lets you take a look at the current rankings. There are three types of rankings: the Runners' League, in which you compete against other players to try and reach the top division; the Friends Rankings, where you can see how your friends are progressing; and the World Rankings, where players from all over the world duke it out for the top spot.<br>
Furthermore, selecting "History" allows you to view historical rankings, and see who's been at the top of the tree in the past.<br>
Each ranking is divided into two categories: High Score, which is based on the highest score accumulated in a single attempt, and Total Score, which is based on the total number of points acquired during a given period.</p>

<h4>Roulette</h4>
<div class="cf">

<p>This screen allows you to win items and new companions by playing various types of Roulette. Playing Premium Roulette costs Red Star Rings, and allows you to acquire new companions.<br>
Collect 10 Special Eggs, either while playing or via Premium Roulette, and you'll be given a chance to play Special Roulette.<br>
Item Roulette is free to play, but you can only spin the wheel a certain number of times each day. You can win items and Rings by playing Item Roulette. Item Roulette has three stages, Normal, Big, and Super. You will proceed to the Big and Super stages when the Roulette wheel stops in the appropriate places. There's a Jackpot slot on the Super stage—if the wheel stops there, you'll win the biggest Ring prize out there!</p>

<h4>Characters</h4>
<div class="cf">
<p class="pc">Characters</p>
<ul>
<li>These are the playable characters you can use in-game.</li>
<li>When you first start playing the game, Sonic is the only playable character you can use, but as you progress through the story, other characters such as Tails and Knuckles will become available.</li>
<li>There are three different character types: Speed, Fly, and Power. Each type has its own special action.</li>
<li>Each character also has a “personality type”. Sonic, Tails and Knuckles are all “Hero” personalities, meaning you’ll be awarded a bonus on the results screen based on the distance you covered.</li>
<li>You can use up to two characters on a stage: a main character and a sub-character.</li>
<li>To use a sub-character while playing, you will need to use the “Sub-Character” booster item.</li>
<li>You can switch characters by touching the icon in the bottom-left of the screen. You will also switch characters if one of your characters comes a cropper. After you’ve touched the icon to switch characters, you cannot switch again for at least 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="sp">Characters</p>

<h4>Companions</h4>
<div class="cf">
<p class="pc">Companions</p>
<ul>
<li>”Companions” will accompany your characters on their adventures.</li>
<li>You can team up with two companions at a time: a main companion and a sub-companion.</li>
<li>Each companion has their own unique effect on your performance.</li>
<li>Companions effects include score boosts and item efficiency boosts. Some companions produce special effects when combos of certain lengths are performed, while others come into their own against bosses. The possibilities are endless!</li>
<li>Each companion has a rarity rating: Normal, Rare, or Super Rare. The rarer a companion, the more powerful the effect it produces.</li>
<li>Just like playable characters, companions have types: Speed, Fly, or Power. Companions are even more effective when they accompany characters of the same type.</li>
<li>New companions can be acquired by playing Premium Roulette, or by collecting 10 Special Eggs and playing Special Roulette.</li>
<li>Acquire more and more companions, and your total Companion Bonus will increase, based on their number and ability levels. This total Companion Bonus is applied to the scores you achieve in-game (up to a maximum of 100%).</li>

<h4>Booster Items &amp; Equippable Items</h4>
<div class="cf">
<p class="pc">Booster Items &amp; Equippable Items</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you head out onto a stage, you’ll be taken to a screen where you can equip items or buy new ones using Rings.</li>
<li>Booster Items are bought using Rings, and will be used mid-stage.</li>
<li>Booster Items are active for the entire duration of your run.</li>
<li>If you already own Equippable Items, you can go ahead and equip these for use on the upcoming stage. If you don’t own any Equippable Items you’d like to use, you can buy more using Rings, then equip them before the stage begins.</li>
<li>Up to three Equippable Items can be equipped at any one time. Equippable items will be used, in the order they are equipped, at the following times: the start of a stage; when the game speeds up; when the game speeds up for the second time.</li>
<li>Equippable Items also appear on stages. These have the same effects as the items you equip before starting a stage, but last about half as long.</li>
</ul>

<section id="spec04">
<h4>Premium Roulette</h4>
<ul>
<li>Premium Roulette is a form of roulette that allows you to acquire new companions.</li>
<li>You can play Premium Roulette by spending Red Star Rings.</li>
<li>Companions have one of three rarity ratings: Normal, Rare, and Super Rare. The rarer a companion is, the harder it is to acquire via Premium Roulette.</li>
<li>If the wheel stops on a companion you already own, that companion’s level will increase by one.</li>
<li>If the wheel stops on a companion you already own who has already reached the maximum possible level, you will acquire a Special Egg instead.</li>

<li>Dr. Eggman will also confront Sonic and the gang at the end of certain Episode Maps. These stages are not ordinary endless running stages, but rather special boss battle showdowns. The stage will not end until Dr. Eggman has been defeated.</li>
