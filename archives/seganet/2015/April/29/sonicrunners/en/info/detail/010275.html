	Three new Companions have been added to the Premium Roulette.</div>
<div>
	They&#39;re bound to come in handy as you speed towards a new high score!</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	RC Battle Cruiser:</div>
<div>
	This elusive Companion makes more Red Star Rings appear during boss battles. Level it up to increase the rate! The perfect Companion to help you stock up on Red Star Rings.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	RC UFO:&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Collect Crystals, Rings, and Animals in rapid succession to execute a Combo. When the Combo reaches a certain amount, the RC UFO will collect all Animals currently on the screen! Level it up to shorten the Combo amount required to activate. Use it and see your score climb to new heights!</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	RC Electromagnet:</div>
<div>
	Beloved among players, the Magnet draws Rings, Crystals, and Animals to you. The RC Electromagnet makes the Magnet last even longer, especially after you level it up! The ideal Companion for making sure those combos stay active.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	To commemorate the arrival of these three awesome Companions, we&#39;re increasing their drop rate in the Premium Roulette!</div>
<div>
	Don&#39;t miss this chance! The rates will only be increased for a short time, ending on 3/29 2:59PM (UTC)</div>
