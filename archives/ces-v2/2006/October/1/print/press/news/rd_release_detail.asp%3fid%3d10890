The 2006 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, will return to Las Vegas, January 5-8, 2006.   
<p>     
      "As the world of audio reaches new heights, attendees at the 2006 International CES will experience first-hand the wave of hot, new audio products and technologies emerging on the market," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences for the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA(r)), the producer of the International CES.
