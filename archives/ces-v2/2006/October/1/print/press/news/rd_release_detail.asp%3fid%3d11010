<span class="section_title">CEA'S SHAPIRO SHARES DIGITAL REVOLUTION INSIGHT AND OUTLINES KEY POLICY CHALLENGES IN 2006 CONNECTIONS CONFERENCE KEYNOTE</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">DTV, IP Video Services, Energy Efficiency and Intellectual Property Identified as Critical Issues for Continued Momentum </span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;5/3/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
Digital technology has permeated every aspect of life today and now extends well beyond the home, but policy roadblocks threaten to stall innovation and curtail consumer choice, warned Consumer Electronics Association (CEA&#174) President and CEO Gary Shapiro today during a luncheon keynote at the tenth annual CONNECTIONS&#8482 Digital Home Conference and Showcase.  Shapiro addressed hundreds of industry executives attending the CONNECTIONS conference in Santa Clara, California, and provided a roadmap to ensure the digital revolution continues.  
<p>      
      "We're almost at the end of the beginning of the digital revolution in consumer technology," Shapiro said, commenting on the digital television (DTV) transition.  "This historic transition in American television is entering its final chapter.  President Bush has signed into law legislation establishing February 17, 2009 as the final date for analog broadcasting - a move CEA has advocated for some time.  But while this date will mark the end of analog broadcasting, it is in many ways just the beginning when it comes to the digital revolution."
<p>     
      Shapiro pointed to the 2006 International CES&#174 as proof of the momentum in the digital revolution.  He also noted growing consumer demand for anytime, anywhere content and the devices that facilitate on-demand access, such as TiVo and Slingbox.    
<p>      
      "Home entertainment has hit a fever pitch and the 2006 CES demonstrated how consumers can have 'home entertainment' everywhere," he said.  "Not only do consumers want access to their content from every room in their house, but also in the car, on any portable device, remotely through the Internet - anywhere in the world.  We have the technology to let them do just that, but we face a few unquestionable roadblocks."  
<p>      
      Consumer choice in broadband, national portability of products and standards and an adequate balance between copyright and consumer home recording and fair use rights all are critical issues for continued success and momentum in the digital revolution according to Shapiro.  He pointed to a March announcement by CEA, AT&T, Bellsouth and Verizon regarding principles for IP-enabled video services as an unprecedented inter-industry commitment to work together toward the advancement of a robust commercial marketplace.   
<p>      
      "IP-enabled video networks and IPTV services will provide consumers across the nation with a revolutionary way to access their favorite video programs when and where they want, but we'll only reach that point through the open roads of competition and consumer choice."
<p>      
      Shapiro also described how rising fuel prices are shifting attention to energy efficiency of consumer electronics products.  
<p>      
      "Our industry has an opportunity to help consumers make informed purchasing and energy management decisions," he said.
<p>      
      Shapiro examined another roadblock the technology industry repeatedly encounters, employing the visual aide of the Wile E. Coyote cartoon character who continually tried to divert Road Runner with phony "Bridge Out" signs.  Shapiro analogized this to technology being held up as the motion picture and music industries continue to seek new legislative, judicial and regulatory tools to prevent innovation and limit the ability of consumers to choose how, when and where they view movies and listen to music.  
<p>      
      "The content industry repeatedly declares the sky is falling, that their world will end because of a new technology, so they must throw it off the tracks.  But their world has never ended and in most instances they come out ahead thanks to the very technology they have tried to obstruct.  We must work together - industry, government and consumers - to ensure the bridge is never out, especially when it comes to consumer fair use."  
<p>      
      He encouraged conference attendees to get involved by supporting the Home Recording Rights Coalition (HRRC) and CEA as they work to preserve the basic principle that products that have substantial non-infringing uses are legal even if they can be used for copyright infringement.  
<p>      
      "We cannot allow the lines between consumer rights and piracy to blur.  Content creators must join technology innovators in creating new business models to leverage technology to keep up with consumer habits, or risk obsolescence."
<p>
