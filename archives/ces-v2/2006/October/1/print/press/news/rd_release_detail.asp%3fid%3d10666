<span class="section_title">Digital Imaging and Future of Radio Panels Kick Off 2005 International CESÂ® Educational Sessions</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Hundreds of Conference Sessions Educate and Excite Attendees</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/7/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
Informative and electrifying conference sessions shaped the first day of  the 2005 International CES by highlighting the breadth and depth of the consumer electronics industry.   Hundreds of conference sessions present throughout the show offer an expansive selection of topics for attendees.  The 2005 International CES runs January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
<p>    
Digital imaging proved to be a hot category on Day One of the 2005 International CES.  Attendees got their first glimpse of Flash Forward 2.0: Bringing Digital Imaging Into Focus and enjoyed a SuperSession on digital still cameras and cell phone cameras.  Executive Technology Editor of Popular Photography and Imaging Magazine,  Mike McNamara, moderated the SuperSession titled "Digital Cameras Get Competition," which delved into the challenges and opportunities presented by digital still camera and cell phone camera competition.  Panelists representing both industries included John Prendergast, vice president of strategic business development, Photo Imaging Division, Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., Inc.; Pierre Schaeffer, vice president and director, business strategy, Eastman Kodak Company and Randy Roberts, head of create & share product category, Motorola. 
<p>      
The panel agreed that technological limitations currently exist for cell phone cameras, including sensors, lenses and processors and that image quality continues to set digital still cameras apart from cell phone cameras.  
<p>
With hundreds of multi-faceted SuperSessions, CNET's SuperSession entitled "The Next Best Thing," presented their take on the products and trends that will move the market in the upcoming year. Focusing on three categories, the "Smart Home," "Smart Portables" and the "Smart Car," CNET editors compared consumer viewpoints with the views of industry leaders in three panels.  CNET also named their "Next Big Thing" finalists in 12 categories, choosing them from over 600 submissions and stating that the winners would be announced at 4 p.m. on Friday at the CNET booth #71351 in Innovations Plus.
<p>
What technologies will attendees find on the International CES show floor 10 years from now? That was the question Forbes Columnist Stephen Manes asked industry insiders from Qualcomm, Philips, Intel and the U.S. Army's Future Force Warrior Program. They agreed that consumers will expect to consume content of their choice everywhere they go. Display screens will be pervasive in every size from ultra-large screens to tiny displays on mobile devices. Sensors will be common, the panelists agreed, in wearable clothing and in the home for fitness and health monitoring. And hybrid devices will continue to combine multiple functions. All agreed the consumer will be the one who ultimately decides what is successful on the market.
<p>      
The audio shootout conference session moderated by Dave Graveline, host and executive producer of Into Tomorrow, delved into the vast array of radio options that are now available to consumers.  The esteemed panel included Bob Struble, president and CEO, iBiquity Digital; Gabe Hobbs, vice-president of programming, Clear Channel; Hugh Panero, CEO, XM Satellite Radio; Joseph Clayton, chairman, Sirius Satellite Radio and Mark Lam, CEO, Live365.  While the panelist may not agree on the content format, the panelists did agree that content is king and consumers are driving the development.  When asked if all the diverse platforms would survive the panelist agreed, "It is like local T.V. versus HBO, consumers want both - not one or the other."     The panel proved that radio re-invents itself to stay current and continues to be the most ubiquitous CE product.
