<span class="section_title">YAHOO! CHAIRMAN TO KEYNOTE AT THE 2006 INTERNATIONAL CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;9/2/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced today that Terry Semel, chairman and CEO of Yahoo! Inc. will deliver a keynote address at the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  
<p>    
      Semel's address is slated for Friday, January 6, 2006, at 9 a.m. in the Hilton Theater at the Las Vegas Hilton. The 2006 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, runs January 5-8 in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
<p>
       "Under Terry's leadership, Yahoo! has solidified its position as the world's leading global Internet destination.  Leveraging Yahoo!'s strength in search, community, personalization and content, Terry and his team continue to introduce new and innovative products, to the delight of consumers around the world," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA.  "With the addition of Terry to the phenomenal line-up of keynoters including Microsoft's Bill Gates, Intel's Paul Otellini and Sony's Howard Stringer, the 2006 keynote program is looking to be one of our best ever."
<p>
      Appointed chairman and chief executive officer of Yahoo! Inc. in May 2001, Semel has continued the company's success by identifying and pursuing new opportunities within Yahoo!'s two core businesses, marketing services and consumer services. He also assembled a talented executive team that has overseen the continued growth of Yahoo!'s global user base, a turnaround in Yahoo!'s marketing services offerings, and introduced new revenue opportunities, including sponsored search, listings and services bundled with high-speed Internet access. 
<p>
      Previously, Semel spent 24 years at Warner Bros., where he was most noted for his role as chairman and co-chief executive officer. He and his partner, Robert Daly, helped build Warner Bros. into one of the world's largest and most creative media and entertainment enterprises. Like Yahoo!, Warner Bros. reaches billions of worldwide consumers through its vast stable of properties. Semel is credited with building Warner Bros. from a single revenue source generating less than $1 billion to nearly $11 billion total revenues from multiple, diverse businesses in 50 countries. Prior to Warner Bros., Semel managed Walt Disney's Theatrical Distribution division, and CBS' Theatrical Distribution division. 
<p>
       The 2006 International CES focuses on more than 30 product areas from more than 2,500 exhibitors spread throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Sands Expo and Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Alexis Park. For more news on CES before, during and after the show, including a detailed keynote schedule, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.
<p>
Note to Journalists:  	Detailed press conference information will be available later this year. Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 3, 2006 to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events.  CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES will run January 3 from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the Sands Expo and Convention Center, Bellini Ballroom.  A list of press room hours and services is posted at www.CESweb.org.
