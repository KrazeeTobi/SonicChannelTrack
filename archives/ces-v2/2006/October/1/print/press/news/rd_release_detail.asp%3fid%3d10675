<span class="section_title">Phenomenal 2005 International CES Reflects Strength Of Digital Revolution</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Consumer Technology Industry Momentum Showcased in Thousands of New Product Introductions</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/9/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
With more than 140,000 attendees from 115 countries witnessing the introduction of thousands of new products and technologies from more than 2,500 exhibitors, the 2005 International CES reinforced its position as the world's greatest technology showcase.  The 2005 International CES ran in Las Vegas, Nev., January 6-9, 2005.
<p>
The show floor was packed with executives from the consumer technology, broadcasting, cable, motion picture and numerous other industries who converged in Las Vegas the last four days to hear from technology industry visionaries and view a spectacular showcase of hot new products and trends in audio, accessories, home networking, mobile electronics, video and wireless.
<p>
"The 2005 International CES succeeded by every measure," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, the producer of the International CES.  "From the international audience, major media and top buyers that came to the International CES, to the top-notch keynotes and conferences, government leaders and exhibitors showcasing the amazing breadth and depth of the CE industry, this event truly was the place to be over the past week for anyone involved in the global consumer technology industry."
<p>
The 2005 International CES set several major show records including number of attendees (142,585 - subject to independent audit), exhibitors (2,550) and exhibit space (1.531 million net square feet).  International attendance also grew to more than 23,028, up from 18,000 at the 2004 CES.  
<p>
The show featured a broad array of exciting product and technology introductions and announcements, many of which provide consumers with unprecedented  control over when, where and how they watch movies, listen to music, view their digital photos and access other information, education and entertainment content.  Showing the strength of the transition to high definition television (HDTV), the show floor not only featured the latest developments in display technologies but a variety of products and innovations that build upon HDTV, such as wired and wireless connections to stream HD video throughout the home and new HD recording devices.
<p>
The latest in digital imaging, digital audio, satellite and HD radio, plasma and LCD displays, home video production, in-vehicle entertainment, VoIP, Ulra-Wideband and more also wowed show attendees.  
<p>
"The consumer technology industry is in the midst of a rapid shift to digital," noted Shapiro.  "As a result, we are seeing numerous exciting product introductions.  The International CES reflects this digital revolution."
<p>
"This year's show seemed to feature more new product announcements and developments than any previous show, cementing the International CES as the global launching pad for new technologies," said Karen Chupka, CEA's vice president, events and conferences.  "Our exhibitors are able to leverage the tremendous media coverage and marketing opportunities that surround the show."
<p>
In addition to standing as a product showplace, the 2005 International CES included a star-studded array of industry luminaries serving as keynoters and participating in more than 350 conference sessions.  The show kicked-off with a keynote from Microsoft's Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates and included keynote presentations from Intel Corporation CEO Craig Barrett; Ron Garriques, president personal devices business and executive vice president, Motorola, Inc.; Carly Fiorina, H-P chairman and CEO; and Rich Templeton, president and CEO, Texas Instruments.  Dozens of industry leaders participated in conference sessions and panel discussions covering the hottest topics in the consumer technology industry.
<p>
The 2005 show also attracted more than 130 top officials from international, federal and state government bodies.  The government leaders joined top executives from the technology, cable, broadcasting and motion picture industries at the show's annual Leaders in Technology dinner.  The dinner featured a keynote from Mike Ramsay, co-founder, chairman and CEO of TiVo, who urged public policy-makers to avoid strangling innovation through overregulation.
<p>
The 2006 International CES will be held January 5-8, 2006 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  More information will be available later this year at www.cesweb.org.
