		Since I was born, I feel  the Music inside of me, because my father was a Musician. At the age of 8  I  build my first guitar amplifier, helped by an Audio Engineer, my first satisfaction was that this amplifier sounds.

Since that time my life has been rounded by audio and video Technology. I grow up playing my guitar in different kind of music groups and dedicated to the professional audio. After that I have been working on the Audio business, first in the home systems, then in car audio and security systems.

I was the fist one bringing the car audio’s technology to México, it was great success for me and all the people that came after me. My work in that time was focused to the car audio
because of the market’s demand, but lately the development of new products and technologies guide me to open my  action field to another  applications like the Home Theatre and Mobile video.

In the nearly years when I note that here in México was not exist any publication about Audio, Video, High End and Technologies for the mexican consumers, I decide to start with a very good friend Lic. Juan Marquez () the project of STEREOMANIA Magazine, a publication dedicated to promote new technologies and innovations between the consumers here in Mexico .

I think  that more than 30 years in this business and more than 25 years attending to CES  have bring me  the experience to keep going with technology day by day. I know the CES is my strongest tool to go ahead.

In his new company, Rick can work in his areas of expertise and give his clients the one on one attention they deserve.   As a seasoned veteran in the product development, Rick brings his years of experience in designing and manufacturing to bear on challenging project from furniture design to efficient layouts of mega yachts to hand held electronics.  Rick brings strategic alliances to the table when the breath and scope of a project exceeds his resources.  These alliances augment and synergize with his expertise.  “Working with Peter Muller from Interform and Jim Girard from Origin Design and John Jamieson from 2ndEdison allow me to offer product development resources better than you can find at any one location.  Big firms just don’t have the flexibility to really design and scale a project to be optimal for their client needs.  This is what I have set out to correct.”

Rick earned his product design degree at Southern Illinois University, where he also taught senior level design courses. His work spans many disciplines from Buckminster Fuller projects in Haiti, wheelchair designs & lighting to custom furniture for celebrities, including Madonna and Michael Douglas. His eclectic design interests have led to successful design projects with clients such as Sun Microsystems, Apple, Nokia, HP, Coca-Cola, Palm, NASA, and AT&T.

Commissioned to a number of design projects, Gad Shaanan Design became a corporation in 1981.  Gad Shaanan Design has flourished to become one of the leading product development firms in North America.  The Company’s success is based upon a tight integration of strategic marketing, innovative design, engineering and coining the term “inventing opportunities”.  As the leader of Gad Shaanan Design, Gad is dedicated to helping companies of all sizes, from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, meet and exceed their business goals through new product innovation.  This approach propelled his work to become so globally pervasive.  Millions of people carry Kyocera cell phones developed by Gad Shaanan Design.  Passengers from New York City, to Mexico City, to Kuala Lampur, ride daily on trains thoughtfully designed by Gad’s team for their client, Bombardier.  The firm enriches the lives of consumers worldwide, while continuously expanding the horizons of its clients.  Today Gad lives in San Diego where he runs the west coast office and further develops his enthusiasm for inventing opportunities.
