</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Jim Minarik, president, Clarion
Sales Corporation:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;CES has provided a fabulous forum to launch the
Car PC, the first in-vehicle product to incorporate the Windows
CE operating system. There has been great attention, great attendance,
and the press coverage has been huge. Of course, it didn't hurt
to have Bill Gates talk about the product. The show is very important
for our Latin American dealers as well.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Jim Palumbo, vice president of TV
products, Sony Electronics, Inc.:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;A lot of people have been waiting to get into
the booth...CES is a terrific vehicle for Sony to showcase its
technology. You've got the world's [electronics] industry in Las
Vegas, and there's no better place to show it than CES.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Lisa Haley, vice president and general
manager for new business, Philips Consumer Electronics:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;I think this show is different from some of the
ones in the past. We're seeing the start of the new technologies
we've been hearing about for so long. Everyone seems to be coming
together in agreement. It's a great place to showcase.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Victoria Durkin, director of marketing,
MTX Paging Products:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;We couldn't be happier with CES, our first major
showcase of the Beepwear watch. There has been a lot of interest
from buyers and the media, and a great number of inquiries from
various international markets.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Steve Masters, program manager,
Microsoft Corp.:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;The show has been a huge success for us in the
past, and we've gotten a really great reception this year...Auto
PC specifically has been very well received... We've seen really
good interest from the OEM community, the press, and everybody
who stopped by. This is a much bigger presentation than we had
last year, and we're continuing to learn a lot about the consumer
marketplace.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Will West, president, PHAST:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;It's great! It's our second CES, and we couldn't
be more pleased. We'll be doing CES every year - it's a great
place not only for contacts but for all our dealers.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Nancy Fuller, senior program manager,
Sun Microsystems, Inc.:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;At the very least it's been a very good show
for us. We had about 700 people a day coming through our booth...
It's been exhausting but good, and we already have a similar exhibit
space set for next year.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Marv Tseu, executive vice president,
worldwide sales and marketing, CIDCO Inc.:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;This was a terrific event for us. We met with
telecommunications leaders from around the world, and we've been
delighted with the response to the iPhone, which we believe will
reinvent telephony as we know it. The international flavor of
the CES was significant.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Dean Shulman, senior vice president,
Brother International Corp.:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;CES is getting bigger and it is getting more
exciting. The number of visitors and exhibitors is getting bigger
than ever. This is absolutely one of the few times you can bring
people into a fun city like Las Vegas, and though it's long days
and long nights, it's the best opportunity you have to meet with
new customers.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Dan McLeod, vice president, sales,
Rockford Fosgate:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;I was extremely impressed with the show. There
was tremendous attendance, and our products and new booth were
well received. I believe that 1998 will be an up year for mobile
electronics.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Victor Mims, manager, sales and
product training, Samsung Telecommunications America:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;It was a great show for Samsung. We showcased
our new Windows CE-based smart phone technology and cordless phone
products to a large number of mass retailers. CES is of tremendous
importance to our retail efforts.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Thomas Topalian, media relations
manager, Lucent Technologies Microelectronics Group:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;Traffic was high through our booth at the Sands.
We conducted key meetings with OEMs and showcased our new DSP
for video conferencing and our digital TV chip sets that allow
broadcasters to transmit digital programming to TVs or PCs.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Tom Graham, director of marketing,
Yamaha Corp.:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;We had a lot of traffic in the booth, and everything
went very well. We've already picked our booth space for next
year and signed our contract. CES is one of the few opportunities
we have to show a lot of people at once what's new.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Mark Stein, director of marketing,
Marantz America:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;We're very pleased. In terms of traffic, CES
has exceeded our expectations. It's been a really good show.&quot;</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="-1">Pat Roche, project specialist for
new business, Lutron:<BR>
</FONT></B>&quot;In terms of traffic and volume, things are going
great. We've gone through many more leads this year than last
year.&quot;</CENTER>
