DTV in its broadest terms includes High-DefinitionTelevision (HDTV), Standard Definition Television (SDTV), anda host of other potential applications. HDTV defines certain minimumperformance attributes that deliver approximately twice the resolutionof current TVs. SDTV refers to a system that provides a displayresolution lower than that of HDTV.</td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" width="25" valign=top ><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Do consumers want HDTV?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" width="25" valign=top><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">Absolutely. From black-and-white TV to color, from phonographs to CDs, from videotapes to DVD, the American consumer has never passed up the opportunity to take advantage of improved video and audio performance. HDTV is nodifferent. Surveys of consumers who have seen the technology indicate an overwhelming interest in its revolutionary picture and sound quality improvements and its potential for interactivity (seeCEMA/Verity HDTV consumer focus group research).</td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" width="25" valign=top><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Why would I buy a regular analog TV set with DTV coming?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" width="25" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">These sets will work for decades.<br>For broadcast signals they will work until at least 2006 and thenlow cost set-top converter boxes will be available. Even if thebroadcast analog signal is ended in 2006, a $1,000 set boughtin 1997 would cost about three cents a minute of average use forthe next ten years.<br>Today's TV sets are a tremendous bargain. Large screen pricesare the lowest in history. Prices have dropped an average of $100per year. </td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT"  valign="top"><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>When the analog signal shuts off, will people throw out obsolete sets?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">Sets won't be obsolete. First, the TV sets will work for decades with cable and home satellite, and forever with current VCRs, DVD and other products. Second, for broadcast television, we expect low cost (under $150) converters to be available when digital signals replace analog signals.<br>As soon as the transition to digital begins, current sets canreceive both the analog and digital broadcasts with the additionof a set-top box. </td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>What does the 2006 termination really mean?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">2006 is a &quot;target.&quot; InWashington, Democrats and Republicans want to balance the federalbudget by the year 2004. Auctioning the analog spectrum has becomea mantra for politicians as one method to help offset a portionof the budget deficits. In reality, few people really believethat DTV penetration by 2005 will allow the shutting-down of theanalog signals by 2006. Federal legislation approved in 1997 allowsfor a continuation of the analog signal in markets where penetrationof digital sets is less than 85 percent.Even though the budget is a politically explosive issue, broadcastersare committed to making huge investments to protect their existingfranchises. </td></tr></table></td><td valign=top width=50%><table><tr><td align="RIGHT" ><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>How many televisions are therein use today?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">There are 250 million TV sets inuse in the United States today.</td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT"  valign="top"><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>How soon will consumers bebuying DTV?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">Conservatively, about 30% of U.S.households are projected to own a digital set by the year 2006.</td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT"  valign="top"><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Will consumers be willing topay higher prices for HDTV?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">Yes, all indications are that this technology will be a tremendous success. In late 1997, cost estimates for the initial HDTV sets were $2,000 - 5,000 more than today's televisions for comparable sets.<br>Currently, one in every four households buys a TV set each year - that's 25 million TV sets a year. And, 18 million of these households have paid at least $2,000 for their TV set. With the average life of a TV at eight years, many of these 18 million households will be ready to replace their analog sets with HDTVs in the first few years of introduction.<tr><td align="RIGHT"  valign="top"><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>How are TV screen sizes measured on HDTV?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">As with today's analog sets, HDTV screen sizes are measured diagonally. But, because the aspectratio on HDTV is 16:9 instead of 4:3 like analog sets, an HDTVset with a comparable height measurement to an analog set willhave a larger screen. For example, today's 35&quot; sets havea 28&quot; X 21&quot; screen measurement. An HDTV set with anequal screen height of 21&quot; will have a 42&quot; screen sizemeasurement. </td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT"  valign="top"><img src="graphics/q.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="BOTTOM"><b>What programming will be availablewhen HDTV hits the retail market?</b></td></tr><tr><td align="RIGHT" valign="top"><img src="graphics/a.gif" border=0></td><td align="LEFT" valign="top">Network executives at ABC, NBC andCBS, and many local broadcasters have committed to provide high-definitionprogramming when they launch the digital channels this year. InitialHDTV broadcasts on the networks will likely include prime-timeprogramming, and local broadcasts of sporting events in HDTV arescheduled during the first quarter of 1998. PBS and its memberstations are expected to make the switch to digital in 1998 witha significant amount of HDTV programming. In addition, cable operatorslike HBO, Discovery Channel and Turner Broadcasting have announcedtheir commitment to provide HDTV programming in 1998, perhapsas early as this summer. It is also likely that HDTV programmingwill be provided by digital satellite systems in 1998.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
