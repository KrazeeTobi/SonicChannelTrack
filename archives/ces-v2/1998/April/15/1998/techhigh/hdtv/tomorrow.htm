<I><FONT FACE="Times">1998 International CES</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Times">
represents the commercial debut of High Definition Television.
 For the very first time, major TV manufacturers are introducing
consumer HDTVs and announcing plans to bring them to market during
the fourth quarter of 1998.  Show attendees can watch over-the-air
HDTV feeds from experimental DTV stations at the facilities of
KLAS-TV (CBS-affiliate) and KLVX-TV (PBS-affiliate).  A third,
in-house &quot;feed&quot; will feature Rebo Group programming
and productions.  Soon, consumers will be able to bring home the
many benefits of digital television and enjoy HDTV broadcasts
right in their own living room.</FONT></p>

<FONT FACE="Times">Digital and high-definition sets will be on
retail shelves in the fourth quarter of this year.  Consumers
can  finally realize the benefits of high-definition technology:
 Crisp, clear pictures, and CD-quality sound.  Initially, most
DTVs will be large screen sets.  As with most new consumer technologies,
the initial sets will be expensive.  Some price estimates range
from $2,000-5,000 over current set prices for comparable sizes.
 Other estimates are as high as $8,000-10,000 for HDTVs.  Prices
will drop as demand increases and economies of scale are released.
Historically, the price of consumer electronics products drop
50% within 10 years of introduction.</FONT></p>

</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">Traditional analog televisions will
continue to receive broadcast signals until at least the year
2006, and probably longer.  Once the switch to digital broadcasts
is complete, today's televisions will be able to receive the new
signals with the addition of a set-top converter box.  And, other
technologies - like cable, VCRs, DVD, and home satellite - will
continue to work with today's televisions for years to come. </FONT>
<p><B><FONT size="4">HDTV Broadcasts-Coming Soon</font><BR>
(via Broadcast, Cable, Satellite)<BR>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">Broadcasters have promised there
will be at least one digital station in each of the top ten markets
by November of 1998.  Broadcasters are required by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to transition to digital in the
top ten markets (reaching 30% of US households) by May of 1999,
and in the top 30 markets (reaching 50% of US households) by November
1999.  Broadcasters will continue to carry traditional analog
broadcasts until at least 2006, and probably longer.  In addition,
cable operators, like HBO, have said they may have HDTV programming
as early as this summer.</p>
<p><B><FONT size="4">Steady Transition from Analog to Digital
<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">Consumers want HDTV.  From black-and-white
TV to color, from phonographs to CDs, from videotapes to DVD,
there is proof the American consumer has never passed up the opportunity
to take advantage of improved video and audio performance.  HDTV
is no different.  Surveys of consumers who have seen the technology
indicate an overwhelming interest in it's revolutionary picture
and sound quality improvements and its potential for interactivity
(See CEMA/Verity HDTV consumer focus group research).  <BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">Currently, one in every four households buys
a TV set each year - that's 25 million TV sets a year.  And, 18
million of all U.S. households have paid $2,000 or more for their
TV set.  With the average life of a TV at eight years, many of
these 18 million households will be ready to replace their analog
sets with HDTVs in the first few years of introduction.  Market
analyses predict conservatively that 30 % of U.S. households will
have digital sets by 2006.  All indications are that this technology
will be a tremendous success.<BR>
