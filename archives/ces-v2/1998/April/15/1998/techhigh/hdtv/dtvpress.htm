Through its laboratories and design facilities in the U.S,Panasonic has actively pursued research and development activitieson digital TV and HDTV since 1982 As evidence of Panasonic's ongoingdevelopment work to usher in the new digital television era, thecompany previewed a number <I>of </I>current and prototype digitaltelevision products at the 1998 Winter Consumer Electronics Showhere.<P>Among the products growing out of development efforts and shownat this annual trade gathering were: the CT-36VG50, a &quot;digital-ready&quot;SVGA TV/Monitor introduced earlier this year; a prototype 36&quot;wide-screen (16:9 aspect ratio) direct view<P>signals through a set-top converter box, also under development.In addition to demonstrating playback of taped digital video sources,the prototype products also played special over-the-air programmingtransmitted from experimental TV facilities at a local Las Vegasnetwork affiliates.<P>&quot;Panasonic's digital television strategy will address twodifferent audiences,&quot; says Cove. &quot;For the early adoptor,we will offer now full-featured digital televisions, as well astransitional products, such as Panasonic's unique multi-scan SVGATV/Monitor which accepts all digital signals and displays themat up to a maximum 800 lines of horizontal resolution. And, forthe consumer who looks to retain an existing NTSC set and stillreceive digital signals, we plan to offer a Panasonic-developedset-top converter. As easily connected to a television as a cablebox, the converter will receive all digital signals and play themback on NTSC televisions.&quot;<P>Panasonic anticipates offering digital television products inthe Fall of 1998. To help encourage a smooth and rapid transitionto digital television - in whichever format broadcasters willselect for over-their transmissions - each of the company's plannedofferings will be able to receive and decode all Advanced TelevisionSystems Committee (ATSC) digital signal formats, including wide-screenHD1V.<P>Panasonic consumer digital televisions products will be markedin the United States by Panasonic Consumer Electronics Company,a division of Matsushita Electric Corporation of America (MECA).Other MECA division companies are already providing digital andHDTV video equipment to the major broadcast networks, as wellas digital electronic news gathering and production equipmentfor local television stations, as they prepare for the country'stransition to digital broadcasting. MECA is the principal NorthAmerican subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.(MEI), of Japan, one of the world's largest producers of electronicand electric products for consumer, business and industrial use.<BR><P><hr><a name="philips"><B>For more information contact: </B><P><TABLE ><TR><TD WIDTH=181><B>Philips Electronics</B></TD><TD WIDTH=129>Jill Greenman </TD><TD WIDTH=280>770/821-2236</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=181><B>Brodeur Porter Novelli</B> </TD><TD WIDTH=129>Joe Blumenfeld </TD><TD WIDTH=280>617/587-2019</TD></TR></TABLE><P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>PHILIPS DELIVERS ON THE PROMISE OF<BR>DIGITAL TV WITH LARGE</FONT></B>-<B><FONT SIZE=5>SCREEN HIGH DEFINITIONPROJECTION TELEVISION</FONT></B></CENTER><P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>64-Inch Rear Projection HDTV to Usherin Digital TV Era<BR></FONT></B></CENTER><P><B>WCES, LAS VEGAS, NV, January 8, 1998-</B>Philips Electronicsis leading the digital revolution with the announcement of a 64-inchrear projection television with a true<P>high definition display and Dolby Digital sound. Leveraging morethan 10 years of research and development in digital television,Philips has incorporated the latest technologies into its firstDigital TV offering. The Philips HDTV will be unveiled at PhilipsElectronics Booth # 620 at the Las Vegas Convention Center duringWCES, January 8 - 11. Philips HDTV is planned for introductionin the fall of 1998, and will coincide with the first digitalbroadcast signals to be transmitted later this year.<P>&quot;1998 will be a historical year as the television industryenters the Digital Era, and Philips is excited to be a leaderin this transition with our first HDTV offering,&quot; said RobertMinkhorst, President and CEO, Philips Consumer Electronics Company.A founding member of the Grand Alliance, Philips has worked hardto develop standards for Digital TV that will benefit our customers.The transition to digital marks a paradigm shift in how consumerswill experience television in their homes - much the same waythat the transition from black and white to color changed televisionin the 1950s and 60s. We are committed to developing a range ofDigital TV products over time and supporting both our retailersand customers during this transition.&quot;<P>Consumers who want the most out of a home cinema experience, andare building their home theaters with the absolute latest technologiesavailable, are expected to be the early adopters for the PhilipsHDTV product in the early Digital TV marketplace. Philips is alsodeveloping analog to digital conversion products that will allowconsumers to protect the investments they make in television setstoday.<P>Philips' rear projection digital television uses the latest technologyto create an incomparable cinema experience. Full ATSC decodingand NTSC decoding, coupled with a maximum high definition interlaceddisplay of 1080 X I925 lines of resolution, deliver the best rearprojection television picture available today. For example, withPhilips HDTV, a viewer would no longer see just a little girlon the screen, but also the freckles on the little girl's forehead.Digital television has expanded the home cinema experience byenabling sharper, cleaner, more realistic pictures, plus crystalclear CD-quality sound.<P>In addition to an unsurpassed digital picture, the Philips 64-inchrear projection television comes equipped with Dolby Digital surroundsound, placing viewers in the middle of the action. To help consumerscomplement the already extensive compact disc quality audio offeringof the television, Philips has included an extensive jack panelcomprised of three rear A/V inputs as well as one front A/V input.<BR><P><FONT SIZE=1>Philips Consumer Electronics Company designs, manufactures,markets and services consumer and business electronics products.Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, it is a division of PhilipsElectronics North America Corporation, with more than S7 billionin annual sales and corporate headquarters in New York.

Inaddition to REBO, providers of HD content to the convention floorwill be the CBS and PBS television networks.<P>&quot;The CES Show has always been one of the most important mediaevents of the year, so we're particularly proud to be participatingin such an important way. This year, with the introduction ofdigital and HDTV consumer TV sets to the industry, is particularlysatisfying to us, having pioneered GDTV in the United States since1986&quot; remarked Barry Rebo, one of the studios founders, alongwith Tomio Taki.<P>The REBO programming feed will draw from the studio's extensivelibrary of original HDTV programming. Included will be the voiceof the HD originated natural history series <B>Wild!Life</B> <B>Adventures</B>that REBO is currently co-producing with Turner Original Productionsand Japan's NHK. Also featured will be <B>Fool's Fire</B>, anAmerican Playhouse presentation REBO co-produced for the formerPBS drama series, and directed by Julie Taymore, whose Broadwayproduction of Disney's &quot;The Lion King&quot; has garneredcritical acclaim and broken all records since its recent opening.<P>Other programs include <B>The White House: Inside with the President'sPhotographers</B>, an award-winning documentary REBO also co-producedwith NHK; a one-hour sampler from the <B>Manhattan Music Magazine</B>live concert series produced by REBO on location at famous NewYork music clubs; and <B>Passage to Vietnam</B>, a documentarycompanion to the award-winning photo-journalism book and CD-ROM.Additional presentations were being set at press time and willbe added to the admittedly diverse presentation.<P>&quot;For this year's CES, we'll be presenting some of the mostinnovative and creative non-fiction &amp; performing arts orientedprograms made in HDTV to date,&quot; continued Rebo. &quot;WhilePBS and CBS will be broadcast to the convention floor via terrestrialtelevision stations in the Las Vegas market, it's appropriatethat our studio's feed will be delivered via cable, as our programmingmix is representative of what's available today from many of themost successful thematic cable channels. Think of what you'llbe seeing from REBO at this year's CES Show as a preview of anew HD programming service we're looking to initiate in the comingyear.&quot;<P>REBO group is comprised of REBO Studio, a production and creativeservices company: REBO Research, a consulting, R&amp;D and productdevelopment company; HDLA, a post-production company in associationwith TVN Entertainment, Inc. of Burbank, CA; and REBO Hi-Vision,a sales and marketing company in Tokyo, Japan.

Highlights of the study were releasedtoday at the 1998 International CES, where manufacturers introducedcommercial HDTV receivers for the very first time.<P>The focus groups targeted a broad base of opinions concentratingon consumers in two categories: (i) early adopters - those witha high awareness level of Digital and HDTV and enthusiasm aboutthe digital TV transition, and (ii) mainstream adopters -- thosewith little knowledge or initial interest in the technology whoown a wide variety of other consumer electronics. Together, thesegroups represent approximately 50 percent of the purchasers inthe potential DTV market. Participants were shown a video andaudio demonstration of the improvements offered by digital andhigh-definition television.<I> </I>When participants were shownan HDTV picture, the reaction was unanimously positive among <I>all</I>consumers, and virtually all strongly preferred HDTV to anylower-resolution digital sets. Early adopters especially preferredthe wide screen presentation format of HDTV over today's sets.<P>&quot;This research is consistent with what we have seen all alongwith HDTV: Seeing is believing,&quot; said Gary Shapiro, presidentof CEMA. &quot;Until now, HDTV has been an intangible promisefor consumers. Now, with the introduction of retail HDTV product,consumers can actually see what this technology is all about -a revolutionary improvement in picture and sound and a varietyof other benefits. This research reinforces what the entire historyof our industry tells us -- that consumers want the highest qualityof video and audio performance they can get.&quot;<P>Focus group participants said they were more likely to purchasea set that could provide them with access to the Internet, interoperabilitywith adjunct products like digital cameras and videophones, andadd-on products like DVD. When asked about &quot;multi-casting,&quot;the ability to simulcast several channels of digital programming,mainstream adopters expressed dissatisfaction with current programming,saying quality improvements in programming were much more importantthan access to additional channels. <P>&quot;In addition to the higher quality video and audio offeredby HDTV, they want connectivity and compatibility. They are lookingat HDTV to be a multi-function device,&quot; said Todd Thibodeaux,Vice President and Senior Economist at CEMA. &quot;While somedifferences occur on pricing issues effecting <I>when</I> theywill buy, there is little doubt that the majority of consumers<I>will</I> purchase this technology at the right price.&quot;<P>The industry estimates that initial sets will range from $2,000-$5,000more than today's sets of comparable size. But, as with otherconsumer technologies, prices will drop quickly as economies ofscale are reached. Conservative predictions are 30% householdpenetration of digital TV sets by 2006. <P>&quot;The research demonstrates that some consumers will pay apremium for digital or high-definition receivers and will purchasethe new sets later this year. Others will wait for the pricesto come down - and they will, as mass production occurs in futureyears,&quot; said Gary Shapiro. &quot;This follows the patternof most new consumer electronics products. This research furthersolidifies our hope for HDTV - it will be a great success withconsumers.&quot;<P>The focus groups were conducted during August, 1997. Two groupseach were held in Orange County, CA, Atlanta, GA, and Dallas,TX. The sessions were moderated by the Verity Group, Inc., Fullerton,CA. Approximately 70 participated in the groups viewing demonstrationsof a 35&quot; 4 X 3 analog TV, a 34&quot; 16 X 9 digital TV capableof 720 lines of vertical resolution, and a 38&quot; 16 X 9 HDTVcapable of 1080 lines of vertical resolution (interlaced). Roughlyhalf of all group participants were pre-selected to representearly adopters while the other half were selected to representmainstream adopters.
