The CES, the world’s largest consumer technology extravaganza, featured HSN Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <B>Barry Diller</B>, the show's keynote speaker, who advised the packed auditorium to throw conventional wisdom out the window if they are seeking success in the consumer electronics marketplace.  </P>
<P>Joining the host of distinguished speakers was <B>Vice President Al Gore</B> live from Washington, D.C., marking the first time a vice president has addressed International CES.  Other speakers included Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA) Board Chairman <B>Bob Borchardt</B>, the co-chairman of Recoton; and CEMA President <B>Gary Shapiro</B>. </P>
<P>Diller told attendees he believes "every known should be questioned with as much vigor as the unknown."</P>
<P>"What rules do you have to break?  What conventions do you have to flout?" Diller asked, stressing that the best lesson he could give the audience is to "distrust conventional wisdom."  "Avoid the tricks and games that make us all falsely secure that our products will succeed in the marketplace," he added.</P>
<P>Addressing the audience from a live feed from Washington, D.C., Vice President Gore congratulated the consumer electronics industry.  "You've got some really exciting products that have captured the imagination of people all across the United States and other parts of the world."  Gore also announced a partnership between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and major electronic manufacturers to recognize televisions and VCRs that use less energy.  Starting this month, the EPA will award special "Energy Star" labels to TVs and VCRs that meet the federal government's energy and pollution standards.  "The leadership of the electronics industry in this area is especially important," Gore said.  "TVs and VCRs use electricity even when they're turned off.  The new Energy Star models reduce that leakage by 50 to 75 percent.  Ultimately, that will mean more than $500 million a year in energy savings for consumers."</P>
<P>In his industry outlook, Bob Borchardt encouraged the retail sector to go out of its way to demonstrate products to potential customers.  "Where is the sizzle?  Where is the pizzazz?" Borchardt said, adding that the old saying about "seeing is believing" is especially true for potential electronics product buyers.  Borchardt explained, "We must get the consumer involved in the product.  Products need to be explained and explained correctly.&quot; </P>
<P>Gary Shapiro told the audience that the shift to digital television (DTV) is historic, and is part of the technology shift to digital, which will define the era.  He cautioned that &quot;the transfer to DTV will be successful but it will not happen overnight."  "The early adopters will only buy a few thousand sets," he said.  He added, however, that HDTV "soon will be the centerpiece of the home theater system."  Shapiro announced that CEMA members had agreed on standard definitions for digital television products so that consumers would not be confused.  </P>
<P>Steve Forbes, President and CEO of Forbes Inc., and editor-in-chief of <I>Forbes</I> magazine, later provided an economic outlook address to more than 1,000 CES attendees.</P>
<P>Oracle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison addressed select invitees today in a lunchtime presentation, and this afternoon, Sun Microsystems Chairman, President and CEO, Scott McNealy will deliver the Technology Keynote.  Microsoft President and CEO Bill Gates will present an Executive Perspective tomorrow, from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m.  All the presentations will be held in the Hilton Theater at the Las Vegas Hilton.</P>
<P>The 1998 International CES - The Source for Consumer Technologies, offers over a million square feet of exhibit space, assigned to more than 1,600 companies from all over the world.  Featured throughout the show are digital technologies such as DVD, DSS, TV/PC, handheld computers, smart phones, pagers, wireless products and more.  Crowning the lineup of products this year is the retail debut of HDTV.</P>

<P>CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), the 74-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade association representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information and multimedia products which are sold through consumer channels.</P></body><html>
