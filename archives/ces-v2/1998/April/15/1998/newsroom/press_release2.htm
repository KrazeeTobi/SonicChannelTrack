<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor660300"></A>World's Largest 12-Volt Show to be
Part of 1998 International CES</CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, September 22, 1997. Retailers looking for hottest
car sound and security products for 1998 should make their plans now for
the 1998 International CES&REG; - The Source for Consumer Technologies,
to be held January 8-11, 1998 in Las Vegas, Nevada. As of early September,
190 mobile electronics companies already had been assigned more than 160,000
net square feet of space within the Sands Expo &amp; Convention Center.
This size makes CES the world's largest trade-only exposition for the mobile
electronics industry.</P>

<P>&quot;Overall CES excitement is growing with more than 1,300 companies
signed up to exhibit, high attendee pre-registration levels and a slate
of extraordinary speakers. A limited amount of exhibit space is still available
for mobile electronics companies, but it's going fast,&quot; said Robbi
Lycett, vice president of CES. &quot;Some of the biggest players in mobile
electronics will be showcasing the newest developments in car audio, security
and navigation at the Sands, including Alpine, Audiovox, Blaupunkt, Boss
Audio, Cerwin-Vega, Clarion, Cobra, Directed Electronics, Eclipse, Kenwood,
MTX, Recoton Audio, Rockford Fosgate, Sherwood, Stillwater Designs and Whistler.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Plus the 1998 CES Conference Program includes eight sessions aimed
directly at mobile electronics retailers to help their businesses become
more profitable,&quot; added Lycett. All of these sessions will be held
at the Sands:</P>

<P>Managing an Installation Bay; Promotions that Get People in the Store;
Selling Techniques for GPS and Car Navigation; Car Audio: Selling the Sound
Experience; Auto Security: It's More than an Anti-Theft Device; Examining
OEM and Leasing Options; Mobile Electronics: What's on the Horizon; and
AutoMedia 2000.<B> </B></P>

<P>A special Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Pavilion to help mobile
electronics retailers take advantage of the car navigation market will be
located at the Sands as well. The Pavilion allows manufacturers to get their
feet wet in marketing their ITS products at CES without the financial and
logistical obligations of launching a full product line and booth. This
year's participants include ATX Technologies, AutoLink, Etak Inc., ITS America,
IVS, Navigation Technologies, RoadTrac and Trav Route Software.</P>

<P>The Sands Expo &amp; Convention Center and the Las Vegas Convention Center
are two of the main venues for CES. All major attendee and exhibitor services
will be available at both halls, such as: registration areas, shuttle buses,
meeting/closing rooms, on-site housing assistance, international business
center, press room, CES Store, and CEMA member business center and lounge.
All profits from the CES are reinvested into industry services, including
the Mobile Electronics Certification Program (MECP), media relations programs,
engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and
legal affairs support as directed by the CES sponsor and manager, the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA).</P>

<H3><CENTER><HR><A NAME="anchor662054"></A>Scott McNealy Of Sun Microsystems
To Offer<BR>
Technology Keynote At CES</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P>ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, September 8, 1997. Scott McNealy, Chairman, CEO
and President of Sun Microsystems, Inc. is delivering a technology keynote
address at the 1998 International CES&REG; The Source for Consumer Technologies,
to be held January 8-11, 1998 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sun Microsystems, a
leading global supplier of networked computer systems, had revenues last
year of more than eight billion dollars. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Scott McNealy, a visionary in the computer industry, has special appeal
to the information technology and high-tech attendees at CES,&quot; said
Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association
(CEMA), &quot;We are very pleased to have him address the issues of technology
companies, which are the major corporate CES attendees. Sun's phenomenal
success with its Java programming language has done much to change the landscape
of software companies and corporate customers, and we view Sun as an innovative
force in the consumer technologies industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
McNealy's presence at CES follows the growing trend of the broadening of
consumer technology. CES incorporates many product categories now used in
office environments, such as Internet telephones and devices, personal digital
assistants, and other products that are leading many corporate technology
purchasers to CES. The 1997 CES event hosted over 5,700 corporate and institutional
buyers, and over 16,000 attendees with the title of President/CEO/Owner.
Shapiro notes, &quot;There is a growing interest of CIO and CTO titles at
CES.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For more than a decade, McNealy has been advancing Sun's networked vision
and slogan - &quot;The Network is the Computer.&quot; Since taking the reins
as CEO at Sun in 1984, McNealy has steered the company to growth and profitability.
In 1995 Sun was named one of the world's 100 best-managed companies (by
<I>Industry Week</I>), and McNealy was named as one of the nation's top
25 managers (by <I>Business Week</I>). The Technical Business Research Group
has recently rated Sun the #1 technology company, praising its market, technology,
product, manufacturing and management strategies. Sun has also been associated
with the Internet craze, with the success of the use of Java on the Web.
Sun can be found in more than 150 countries and on the WorldWide Web at
http://www.sun.com. <BR>
<BR>
As an opinion maker, McNealy is well known for being controversial in his
views and under his leadership, Sun has maintained its offbeat edge. He
likes it to be known that he is probably the &quot;longest running and most
belligerently consistent&quot; spokesperson for freedom-of-choice for computer
users through open systems. McNealy's address at CES will take place on
Friday, January 9, 1998 from 4:00-5:00 p.m.</P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor663427"></A>Home Systems Take Greater Role At
1998 International CES</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><I>Habitech Conference Sessions Bolster January Event</I></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, September 9, 1997. The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association (CEMA) announced today that its 1998 International Consumer
Electronics Show (CES&REG;) will expand its conference sessions and exhibits
to make CES the premier event for the home systems industry. Show management
will develop an intensive Habitech conference program to train the dealers/installers/integrators
involved in the broad home systems marketplace. The show runs January 8-11,
1998 in Las Vegas, with the Las Vegas Hilton serving as the primary facility
for professionally installed home theater and home systems.</P>

<P>&quot;This is a win-win situation for the industry,&quot; proclaimed
Gary Shapiro, CEMA president. &quot;Thousands of installers and integrators
come to CES every year - many of them selling and installing products that
fall into this broad category, including home theater and lighting control,
security systems, PC networks, and telecommunication systems. The joining
of a first rate, dedicated conference program with the world's premier showcase
of consumer technology makes this a must-attend event.&quot;</P>

<P>Home systems training sessions at CES will focus on a variety of issues,
including how-to installations, marketing/business tools, and technology
seminars. Each session will offer top-notch presenters and take-home materials.</P>

<P>Working with a CEMA/CES Event Advisory Committee, show management determined
that a unified event in January would attract a larger, more qualified attendance
than would a stand-alone Habitech show. The Event Advisory Committee, now
chaired by RRH Associates', Richard Holtz, is comprised of top industry
representatives from AMP, Crestron, Echelon, Elan, Home Systems Plus, Intellon,
Intelogis, Lite Touch, Multiplex Technologies, PHAST, Savoy Automation,
USTec, X-10, and Xantech.</P>
