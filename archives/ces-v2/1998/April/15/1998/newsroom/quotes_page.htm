<p><b>Jim Minarik, president, Clarion Sales Corporation:</b><br>
<FONT SIZE="2">ÒCES has provided a fabulous forum to launch the Car PC, the first in-vehicle product to incorporate the Windows CE operating system.  There has been great attention, great attendance, and the press coverage has been huge.  Of course, it didn't hurt to have Bill Gates talk about the product.  The show is very important for our Latin American dealers as well.Ó</FONT></p>
