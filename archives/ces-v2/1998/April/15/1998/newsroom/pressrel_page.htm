Generation of Excitement in Entertainment and Productivity</b></CENTER></P><P><B>Las Vegas, NV, January 12, 1998 -</B> The world focused on the digital frontier this week in Las Vegas, as the 1998 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) concluded, with attendees and exhibitors alike lauding it as the most exciting successful show in CES' 31-year history.  CES is the world's largest annual showcase of consumer technology.</P><P>	Gary Shapiro, president of CES sponsor Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), called the show "a resounding success from every standpoint."  He added, "This show exceeded even my loftiest expectations.  The aisles were packed throughout the show with a large international attendee base.  Show attendees were treated to the unveiling of HDTV and other major product launches and industry announcements, along with some of the world's great visionaries.  CES shined this year as the event where 'information' technology became 'consumer' technology, establishing CES as the event for the digital and convergence marketplace.  The range of exciting new products on the show floor was phenomenal, and based on what the industry has seen over these past four days, there is tremendous optimism as we face this new year."  </P><P>	The 1998 International CES featured more than 1,900 exhibiting companies, who showcased their latest and greatest wares in four exhibit facilities: the Sands Expo and Convention Center, Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas Hilton, and Alexis Park Hotel.  CES exhibitors showed the full gamut of consumer technology products, including mobile computing; digital television; custom home theater and home systems; car audio, security, navigation, and multimedia; 900 MHz telephony; wireless phones and pagers; multi-channel audio; new SoHo products; specialty audio; Internet-access devices; flat panel monitors and receivers; accessories; DVD; digital imaging; digital satellite; and everything in between.  Digital high-definition television (HDTV) debuted at the 1998 CES, allowing retail buyers to plan for the pending transition to digital.  More than a dozen manufacturers took multiple live feeds of high-definition programming and displayed it on receivers located on the show floor.  DirecTV provided a major boost to HDTV at CES by announcing that the satellite provider would begin transmitting HDTV nationwide in late 1998.  Antennas beamed up a lot of interest at the show, as the products have become the essential link to receiving digital television (DTV) broadcasts, and local channels through home satellite systems.  Semiconductor manufacturers were also in full force on the show floor, demonstrating the latest chip technology for a host of new consumer products.CES attendees were treated to an array of presentations from top industry executives and world luminaries.  CEMA's Shapiro began the opening session by describing the shift to the digital era and then introduced a surprise guest, Vice President Al Gore.  Via satellite from Washington, D.C., the Vice President chose the CES stage to express his enthusiasm for HDTV and announce new partnerships with leading manufacturers to promote the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Energy Star conservation program.  Recoton CEO and CEMA Chairman Robert Borchardt presented a bullish industry outlook, and then introduced the keynote speaker, chairman and CEO of HSN, inc., Barry Diller, spoke about the value of challenging conventional wisdom.</P><P>Other featured CES speakers included Bill Gates, Scott McNealy, Larry Ellison, and Steve Forbes.  Mr. Gates, president and CEO of Microsoft, and Mr. McNealy, president and CEO of Sun Microsystems, both announced separate deals to incorporate their respective technologies in digital set-top boxes for cable company TCI.  Oracle CEO Larry Ellison gave a special lunch time presentation where he announced new alliances for Oracle's network computing products.  The three top industry executives also provided demonstrations of their latest consumer technology.  Mr. Forbes, president and CEO of Forbes, Inc. discussed how the Asian and American economies will affect the makeup of the consumer technology industry. </P><P>Top industry players were also featured in CES' greatly-expanded conference program, which consisted of more than 100 sessions - double that of the 1997 CES.  The Habitech Institute training program, comprised of ten sessions, made its debut at the 1998 CES.  The track focused on training installers and integrators in the home systems market.  Also new to CES were the Hollyweb: Enhanced TV - TV/Web Convergence Conference sessions, and a track sponsored by the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association (SBCA).  One of the conference highlights was the DTV Supersession, moderated by Joel Brinkley of the New York Times, which featured insight from Joseph Flaherty of CBS, Philip Farmer of Harris Corp., Microsoft’s Craig Mundie, Kay Koplovitz of USA Networks, Circuit City's Alan McCollough, and James Meyer from Thomson Consumer Electronics.  FCC Commissioner Susan Ness also spoke on HDTV as did Sony's John Briesch and Philips' Robert Minkhorst.Analysts and venture capitalists came to CES to seek out the next "grand slam" products, and the greatly-expanded Emerging Technologies pavilion in the Sands provided a consolidated look at up-and-coming companies.  Also in the Sands, the Innovations '98 showcase displayed the best of CES.  </P><P>The consumer technology industry will meet next at the 1999 International CES, January 7-10, 1999 in Las Vegas, Nevada.</P><P>CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), the 74-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade association representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.
