        <span class="smallText">Mar 13, 2012 02:22:42</span>
        
        
        <p>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) plans to expand by some 40 percent the size of the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/techzones.asp#Eureka-Park">Eureka Park TechZone</a>, a dedicated area showcasing innovative start-ups and entrepreneurs, at the 2013 CES. In addition, CEA renews its partnerships with two Eureka Park sponsors, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Startup America Partnership, to secure participation from start-up companies that will introduce innovative products at the 2013 CES.<br />
        <br />
        The Eureka Park TechZone launched at the 2012 CES with 102 exhibitors covering 10,200 square feet. The TechZone was a strong attraction among venture capitalists, media, buyers and other attendees across CES’ diverse audience who were drawn to the “new-to-CES” innovations and emerging technologies. At the 2013 International CES, the Eureka Park TechZone will cover at least 14,000 square feet, allowing an additional 40 startups to participate.<br />
        <br />
        “Based on the success of Eureka Park at the 2012 CES, including innovative product launches, we are expanding its size at the 2013 CES,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. “CES is as much for startup companies looking to make a name for themselves as it is for the big-name companies leveraging the world’s largest technology event. The entrepreneurs in Eureka Park are helping fuel our economy by creating jobs and producing innovative goods and services. We look forward to partnering with Startup America and the NSF to create another successful Eureka Park at CES experience.”<br />
        <br />
        Eureka Park embodies the spirit of innovation regularly promoted by CEA through its Innovation Movement. For more information about joining the Innovation Movement, please visit <a  href="http://www.DeclareInnovation.com">DeclareInnovation.com</a>.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Purchases on Mobile Devices Expanding Dramatically, CEA Study Finds</div>
        <span class="smallText">Feb 27, 2012 03:43:48</span>
        
        <p>More than a third of mobile product owners are using their devices for mobile commerce, according to a new study from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of CES. The Mobile Commerce — Reinventing the Way Consumers Shop study also finds that, on average, each consumer plans to spend $575 on mobile purchases in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 U.S. consumers own a tablet, smartphone or a cell phone, translating into 216 million mobile device owners. More than one-third (37 percent) of mobile device owners are engaging in some form of mobile commerce – either shopping and/or purchasing online or in-store; using and/or redeeming coupons or gift cards; or searching for coupons. While most online purchases are done without mobile devices, those engaging in mobile commerce average more than one-third (35 percent) of all online transactions. The categories most often browsed/shopped for on mobile devices are consumer electronics (CE) and clothing/footwear, while music and books are the categories most often purchased. One-third (32 percent) of consumers engaging in mobile online purchasing have bought CE online using their device.</p>
<p>"The future of mobile commerce is very promising," said Jessica Boothe, manager of strategic research, CEA. "Consumers are open to new technologies as they continue to evolve and develop. With the growth of mobile devices, mobile commerce will play a more integral role in the everyday shopping habits of consumers, especially as they continue to seek bargains and comparison shop."</p>
<p>Many mobile device owners intend to make more purchases using their device in the next 12 months, including shopping and couponing. These consumers expect to spend, on average, $575 on mobile purchases over the next year. Mobile device owners also plan to increase couponing during that time period with one out of three expecting to use their mobile devices more to search for coupons online (32 percent), use/redeem mobile coupons (30 percent), and search for coupons in email (29 percent).</p>
<p>The study also found a number of reasons that consumers who have yet to make any purchase on their mobile device are hesitant to do so: half say they prefer to make purchases in other ways, and more than a third (35 percent) are concerned about security.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent of consumers are comfortable using the mobile Internet because they trust current authentication safeguards, and 25 percent feel comfortable because they trust that their information is safe and secure. Yet, some consumers also have concerns about authentication on their mobile devices. While 42 percent of mobile consumers agree that fingerprint is the best way to authenticate mobile purchases, another 24 percent are not sure as to the best method.</p>
<p>"Consumers want assurances that their personal information is 100 percent safe and secure," said Boothe. "They are not fully confident in technologies available. New and advancing technologies should continue to be explored and developed in an effort to provide consumers with the best and most secure mobile commerce experience possible."</p>
<p>CEA will reveal further results and insights of the study in a webinar on 2-3 p.m. EST Tuesday, March 20. To register, email the webinar team at <a href="mailto:webinars@ce.org">webinars@ce.org</a> or call 703-907-4354.</p>
<p>The study, Mobile Commerce — Reinventing the Way Consumers Shop, was designed and formulated by <a  href="http://www.research.ce.org/Default.aspx">CEA Market Research</a>, the most comprehensive source of sales data, forecasts, consumer research and historical trends for the consumer electronics industry. Please cite any information to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). The complete study is available free to CEA member companies at <a  href="http://members.CE.org">members.CE.org</a>.

        <div class="sub-content-header">CEA Applauds New Visa Pilot Program in China</div>
        <span class="smallText">Feb 23, 2012 03:01:40</span>
        
        
        <p>Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), issued the following statement applauding the U.S. government for its launch of a new Interview Waiver Pilot Program for U.S. visa applicants in China, and for the expansion of visa facilities in Beijing. The pilot program would allow waivers of visa interviews for some applicants. Additional local consular resources are expected to increase visa interview capacity by 50 percent. <br />
        <br />
        "This helpful change to the U.S. visa process for China is another important step in facilitating travel to the U.S. – making it easier for business travelers to come to the U.S. to buy American products and services. The 80 percent of CES exhibitors who are small businesses value the ability to meet international buyers without having to travel and exhibit at overseas trade shows. Easing the visa process will boost our economy, create jobs and reduce the deficit. We would welcome more steps by the U.S. government in this direction, including lengthening visa validity for qualified Chinese nationals traveling frequently to the U.S. on business."<br />
        <br />
        "As owner and producer of the International CES®, the world's largest consumer electronics tradeshow, CEA places tremendous value on international business travel. CES attracts more than 35,000 visitors from outside the U.S. but we can and should get more, especially from significant markets such as China and Brazil. During the past decade, many international business professionals have not been able to attend CES due to delays in U.S. visa processing.”</p>
        <p>CEA has long advocated for such policy changes, as outlined in this <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/11/14/want-more-jobs-quit-making-it-so-hard-for-tourists-to-visit-usa/">opinion piece</a>. According to the U.S. Travel Association, facilitating international travel for U.S. business meetings, tradeshows, conventions and leisure could boost the U.S. economy by $263 billion annually and support 1.7 million American jobs.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">CEA's Innovation Movement Reaches Milestone of 200,000 Members</div>
        <span class="smallText">Feb 14, 2012 10:29:42</span>
        
        
        <p>More than 200,000 people have joined its grassroots <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.declareinnovation.com">Innovation Movement</a> in support of technology and innovation. More than 5,300 Innovation Movement members signed on to the Movement's "Declaration of Innovation" to signal their support of pro-innovation policies during the recent 2012 International CES, the world’s largest technology tradeshow.<br />
        <br />
        CEA provides its Innovation Movement members with tools to contact their members of Congress – via email, Facebook, or Twitter – to support policies that encourage and advance American innovation and shore up our economy for future generations. Issues on which the Innovation Movement is active include international trade, skilled immigration, deficit reduction, broadband deployment, and most recently the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA).<br />
        <br />
        At the <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.CESweb.org">2012 International CES</a>, one of America’s founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, acted as the face of innovation in the show's Grand Lobby in front of a wall that attendees could sign to "declare innovation." Jefferson also toured the show floor asking attendees about their opinions on innovation and seeking electronic signatures for the Declaration of Innovation on a tablet computer.<br />
        <br />
        "CEA launched the Innovation Movement to create an engaged community of Americans who believe innovation is critical to our nation’s global leadership and economic growth," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. "Having the Declaration of Innovation front and center at the largest CES in show history helped shine a light on the policies that directly impact our industry. The attendees, exhibitors, CEOs and celebrities who declared innovation at CES are sending a message to policy makers that now is the time to stand up for innovation."<br />
        <br />
        CEA's Innovation Movement is committed to returning innovation to its rightful place at the center of America’s economic policy. The Declaration of Innovation wall display will be on view at CEA's Arlington, Va., headquarters. Signatures on display include Eliza Dushku, Entertainment Matters Ambassador at the 2012 International CES.<br />

        <span class="smallText">Jan 23, 2012 03:32:13</span>
        
        
        <p>Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.ce.org">Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)</a>, issued the following statement regarding the Senate’s postponement of a vote on the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), as well as the related announcement by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) of the postponement of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House:</p>
        <p>“We appreciate the actions by Senate Majority Leader Reid and House Judiciary Chairman Smith for removing PIPA and SOPA from the agenda. PIPA and SOPA were overly broad bills that would have hurt legitimate businesses, hampered innovation and cost American jobs. We thank all members of Congress who spoke out against PIPA and SOPA.</p>
        <p>“Innovation must be America’s economic strategy. It must not be blocked by one industry seeking to protect itself at the expense of another, especially when core American values are affected. This week millions of Americans declared their concern about the PIPA SOPA legislation and their support for the Internet and innovation. The record-setting volume of calls, tweets, posts and e-mails to Congress spoke to Americans’ willingness to engage in this debate to ensure the Internet remains open and vibrant.</p>
        <p>“We want a smart and targeted solution to the issue of foreign ‘rogue’ websites that steal American trademarks and copyrights. We believe the OPEN Act can and should be passed immediately as it will allow copyright and trademark owners to act quickly against the worst foreign offenders. We urge the content community to embrace it immediately. We also invite discussions, privately and publicly, on the real issue of rogue websites stealing American trademarks and copyrights.”</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">CEA Website Goes Dark Today</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 18, 2012 11:17:50</span>
        
        
        <p>The following statement is attributable to Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) in light of activities surrounding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House, the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) in the Senate and the proposed bicameral Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act:</p>
        <p>“During the course of the last month we have seen a remarkable phenomenon, as millions of Internet-using Americans have risen up against extreme copyright bills proposed by a group of large content companies. We are pleased that their message is beginning to be heard in Washington. In the last few days, Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) finally acknowledged widespread concerns about the cybersecurity implications of domain name system (DNS) blocking.</p>
        <p>“In the House, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) assured House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) that SOPA will not go to the House floor without consensus.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile, Senators Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Jeff Sessions, Mike Lee, Tom Coburn and John Cornyn urged halting consideration of PIPA until outstanding issues are resolved. PIPA sponsor Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) cited the concerns of his constituents and stated he will not vote for the bill in its present form.</p>
        <p>“The White House also issued a statement noting that 'any effort to combat online piracy must guard against the risk of online censorship of lawful activity and must not inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small.'</p>
        <p>“We thank these policymakers for standing up for innovation, and responding to the substantive concerns raised by the wide range of stakeholders opposing SOPA and PIPA. Unfortunately, despite growing recognition that the bill is not yet ready for consideration, the Majority Leader has continued to insist that PIPA be brought to the Senate floor on January 24. CEA joins many tech-related entities in having its websites, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.ce.org">CE.org</a> and <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.declareinnovation.com">declareinnovation.com</a>, go dark today and asks that the bill not be brought to the Senate floor until there has been a hearing, and until serious concerns about private rights of action, search, overly inclusive definitions, third-party liability and other issues have been resolved.</p>
        <p>“It is increasingly clear that bills causing collateral damage to innovation in the guise of fighting piracy are not politically viable. Now that unreasonable solutions to piracy have been shown not to work, it is time to explore reasonable ones. We urge policymakers to join CEA in support of the OPEN Act – a bicameral, bipartisan and narrowly targeted approach to fighting foreign ‘rogue websites.’”</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">LG's 55-inch OLED TV Snags CNET's Best of CES</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 15, 2012 03:20:19</span>
        
        
        A team of CNET editors led the way by picking the most trail blazing, innovative and category-defining products at the 2012 International CES. See the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/awards/bestOfCES.asp">Best of CES</a>. 
        <h3>Best of CES 2012 Award Winners</h3>
        <p><strong>Best of Show: LG 55EM9600 OLED TV <br />
        </strong>The first 55-inch OLED TV announced as shipping in 2011, and the only one to get an actual model number and public ship date ("Q3"), the 55EM9800 promises the superb all-around performance of OLED (absolute black levels, ultra-fast panel and excellent viewing angles) in an ultra-thin panel.</p>
        <p><strong>People's Voice: Razer Project Fiona <br />
        </strong>Razer's Project Fiona concept gaming tablet, shown at CES 2012, suggests that Windows 8 is a serious player in portable gaming, and that Razer is serious about moving into manufacturing computers.</p>
        <p><strong>Cameras: Fujifilm X-Pro1<img alt="" style="float: right;"  src="/images/photos/Best_of_CES_2012.jpg" /><br />
        </strong>Fujifilm bolsters its reputation as a quality camera company with the new X-Pro 1, its first mirrorless model. Targeted at professionals, the camera incorporates several innovations, including a promising new sensor and lovely hybrid viewfinder, all in a sleek retro design.</p>
        <p><strong>Car Tech: QNX CAR 2 mobile apps platform<br />
        </strong>QNX shows us its vision for the future of dashboard technologies, including an innovative application of NFC technology to instantly and automatically Bluetooth pair a smartphone, Ultra HD voice technology that brings stereo CD quality audio to phone calls, and an apps integration for both front and backseat passengers.</p>
        <p><strong>Cell phones: Nokia Lumia 900<br />
        </strong>Nokia uses the Consumer Electronics Show to hold a coming-out party for its new Windows Phone-based Lumia 900, with a 4.3-inch AMOLED screen and dual cameras.<img alt="" style="float: right;"  src="/images/photos/CNET_best_of_CES3.jpg" /></p>
        <p><strong>Emerging Tech: MakerBot Replicator<br />
        </strong>The MakerBot Replicator one-ups the Cube 3D with "dualstrusion" technology, meaning it can print objects in multiple colors and materials. Pre-orders available now for $1,999, shipping in 6 weeks.</p>
        <p><strong>Home Theater: Simple.TV<br />
        </strong>The Simple.TV DVR might just be the next-big thing for cable-cutters. It's improbably a DVR without a built-in hard drive or video output, instead letting you supply your own hard drive, then stream live and recorded over-the-air TV to the Simple.TV app available on iPad, Roku, Boxee, Google TV. Simple.TV can stream your live and recorded over-the-air TV outside your home network (Slingbox-style), as long as you sign up for the $5/month premium service. Think of it like your own personal cloud for your over-the-air TV.</p>
        <p><strong>PCs: HP Envy 14 Spectre<br />
        </strong>The newly announced HP Spectre is the most glass-covered laptop we've ever seen, with it's all-glass lid and palm rest. At a CES devoid of many eye-popping laptops, the Spectre could be the most stylish of the bunch. Beats Audio is included on this premium ultrabook, along with an inset analog wheel for volume control, NFC support, and HP Wireless Audio.</p>
        <p><strong>Software and apps: BlueStacks for Windows 8<br />
        </strong>Windows 8 just got a kick in the apps via BlueStacks. The program, which will ship pre-installed on select Windows 8 machines, will bring the entire Android marketplace to Microsoft's nascent OS. So when Windows 8 launches, more than 400,000 Android apps will be at your fingertips.</p>
        <p><strong>Networking: D-Link Amplifi HD Media Router 3000<br />
        </strong>When released later this month, D-Link's Amplifi HD Media Router 3000 DIR-857 router will be the first on the market that supports USB 3.0, concurrent 450Mbps dual-band with cloud-based and HD Fuel feature that power media streaming.</p>
        <p><strong>Tablets: Asus Memo 370T<br />
        </strong>This quad-core, Android 4.0 tablet proves that premium performance doesn't require a premium price. In spite of its $250 asking price, this tablet comes stock with 1GB of system RAM, 16GB of storage, an 8 megapixel camera, HDMI output, and a 1,280x800 resolution IPS screen.</p>
        <p><strong>TVs: LG 55EM9600 OLED TV<br />
        </strong>The first 55-inch OLED TV announced as shipping in 2011, and the only one to get an actual model number and public ship date ("Q3"), the 55EM9800 promises the superb all-around performance of OLED (absolute black levels, ultra-fast panel and excellent viewing angles) in an ultra-thin panel.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Magisto Earns Major Bragging Rights at CES</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 14, 2012 04:03:47</span>
        
        
        <p>Mobile apps were put to the test during the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/mobile-apps.asp">Mobile Apps Showdown at 2012 CES</a>. Apps producers had two minutes to demo their app, and an applause-o-meter measured audience enthusiasm to determine the winners. <br />
        <br />
        And the winner is...</p>
        <p>The <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.magisto.com">Magisto</a> mobile editing app. Whether it's a 20-minute video of your twins' birthday or a dozen individual videos from your latest trip to wine country, toss them into the Magisto app and it returns back an edited, excited video for you.</p>
        <h3>
        <p>Mobile Apps Showdown Finalists</p>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Magisto<br />
        </strong>How’s this for magic? You shoot some video on your mobile phone and pop off to Magisto. It’s edited into a vignette replete with special effects and title, posted to YouTube. The video production can look a bit amateur, but hey, there’s some artificial intelligence calling the shots.</p>
        <p>Macaw<br />
        There are dozens of apps to keep you healthy, making you hyper conscious of diet and exercise. What’s novel about Macaw (yes, named for the long lived bird) is that it combines US Preventative Medicine ( a company that helps change medical behaviors)expertise in monitoring activity, diet and education about staying healthy, with Qualcomm’s 2Net which lets you use any device (Bluetooth, WiFi, Ant+) into the 2Net platform to let it handle the transmission and management of the data. In a tower of Babel landscape, Macaw may provide the language all of these devices need to speak.</p>
        <p><strong>SkyQ<br />
        </strong>The heavens are an amazing place. SkyQ is an app that brings a deep meaning to celestial objects. It’s a match made in heaven. Just point your iPad anywhere in the sky and the objects are faithfully rendered. Pan down and you can even see what’s under the horizon. Multimedia explanations of what you’re seeing, layering of objects and more make this a planetarium you can hold in your hands.</p>
        <p><strong>Foam Fighters<br />
        </strong>WowWee, a company known for its sense of play, teamed up with AppGear to create Foam Fighters, which mixes physical and virtual play on your iPhone or Android. A little swivel attachment holds a toy plane about six inches from your phone. You control the plane with your movements and shoot the targets you encounter. Your plane is superimposed on your view through your phone — simple augmented reality with hours of fun.</p>
        <p><strong>Aurasma <br />
        </strong>Lite takes augmented reality to another level by letting you augment the world in front of you eyes. Bring CD covers to life or add animated dinosaurs into the scenery in front of you, for example. True explorers can create their own augmented reality programs (Auras).</p>
        <p><strong>CIA Operation Ajax <br />
        </strong>We talk a good talk about ebooks that go above and beyond traditional books but CIA Operation Ajax delivers on infusing the graphic novel with an e- sensibility. It combines a full score, news reels and clips from the 50’s and an unparalleled artistic sensibility along with an intriguing plot.</p>
        <p><strong>Road Bike Cycling Pro<br />
        </strong>We’re talking about a phone that can act as your bike’s odometer, GPS, map router, weather updater and more. It’ll track time, speed, and even altitude, or create a special pace for your training. Share the fun with friends in real time.</p>
        <p><strong>VIPER Smart Start <br />
        </strong>Baby, it’s cold outside and that’s when VIPER Smart Start really earns its keep. Use your mobile phone to control your car and have the motor purring and car warmed by the time you’re ready to leave. It’ll control your lock buttons. Use it as “find my car” app as well, the mobile app turns out to be the biggest driver of sales in the hardware/app combo.</p>
        <p><strong>Securafone<br />
        </strong>There are many apps to protect you from texting while driving (including last year’s DriveSafe.ly Mobile Apps winner). And there are many apps that can help you geo-locate loved ones. Securafone offers a new world of customization as you can set up electronic fences to help rein in adults suffering from dementia. It can help you locate your children on their way home from school. And it help you manage a teen’s obsession with texting while driving. There’s an SOS button that can be configured to call whomever you want and you can even be notified by periods of inactivity. For the sandwich generation parents and caretakers this app can bring a tear to your eye.</p>
        <p><strong>Cinefy<br />
        </strong>Both the judges and the popular vote reflected well for Cinefy, a video editing app, that lets you feel like a Hollywood mogul. By aggregating special effects, music and other embellishments for you and you can use what you need when you need and there’s something for everyone from game developer to home movie maker.</p>
        <p>Developers submitted entries to be judged by a panel of tech experts including <a  target="_blank" href="http://ginasmith.typepad.com/">Gina Smith</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.chrisnull.com">Christopher Null</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.chipchick.com">Helena Stone</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.coolhotnot.com">Dave Whittle</a> and other industry notables. Ten finalists presented on stage at the 2012 International CES, held January 10-13, 2012, in Las Vegas. Readers of the Mobile Apps Showdown website tried the apps and voted for the people’s choice award. Winners were awarded based on audience response, both online and live at the Las Vegas Convention Center at 2:30 p.m. PT on Thursday, January 12, 2012. Co-hosts and fellow techies Gary Dell’Abate and Jon Hein, from SiriusXM Radio's Howard Stern channels, once again brought their inimitable wit and knowledge of all things geek to the festivities. </p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Lytro Camera Named Winner of Last Gadget Standing at CES</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 14, 2012 03:34:08</span>
        
        
        <p>The Lytro camera has been named the winner of <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/last-gadget-standing.asp">Last Gadget Standing</a>. A perennial attendee favorite, Last Gadget Standing challenges contenders to give the product demo of their lives. At stake: bragging rights as the product "most likely to change the face of technology." Guest emcees Gary Dell'Abate and Jon Hein from the Howard Stern Show hosted the event. </p>
        <p>Last Gadget Standing considered the popular online vote, our expert judge’s votes, and its time-tested sense of the key trends at CES 2012. Here are the top ten finalists who presented at the live Last Gadget Standing event on Thursday Jan 12, 2012.</p>
        <p><strong>Lytro — Winner<br />
        </strong>With unanimous enthusiasm the judges felt that this simple box-like camera – that takes the photo first and then let’s you bring the photo into focus – is revolutionary. The secret sauce is a way of capturing total information about the photo so that you can, for example, click anywhere on it and change the focal point.</p>
        <p><strong>Playstation Vita</strong> <br />
        Judges felt that the Vita’s sleek design puts it at the current pinnacle of portable gaming systems. The system’s graphics are so fast that they make the iPad look tortoise like. The AMOLED touchpad screen is crystal clear. As if one touchscreen weren’t enough, the Vita has a rear touchpad as well. Add to that six access motion controls, 2 joysticks, and 2 cameras and the number and typesof different games you can play seems virtually limitless.</p>
        <p><strong>Autom Robot <br />
        </strong>Dr. Cory Kidd thinks that most diets die a quick death because we quit the programs. But what if the program was Autom, the weight loss robot, engaging you in a dialog about your goals? Not every judge was convinced that a robot would win the diet wars, but we want to see what you think.</p>
        <p><strong>Cotton Candy <br />
        </strong>The judges called it Android on a stick. It’s got everything that your Android tablet has at it’s core, but the outer-trappings (like a screen) are gone. That’s why you can grab our stick, take it with you and plug it into any screen via USB or HDMI. Why Cotton Candy you ask? Because it weighs 21 grams — as light as cotton candy.</p>
        <p><strong>WIMM One Dev Preview <br />
        </strong>The judges fretted a bit over this choice since it’s still just a developer’s preview, but it represents the Dick Tracy reality we’re about to live in. The WIMM looks like a wristwatch but with the WIMM kit it can be transformed into a Twitter watch, stocks, weather, a phone … whatever your mobile heart desires.</p>
        <p><strong>Origami <br />
        </strong>The designers behind this new high tech baby stroller have probably been around the block a few times (pun intended). That’s why this one folds with a single touch (though never when it senses baby is sitting) has a electronic dashboard replete with a pedometer, iPod holder, and recharges itself while it’s in motion.</p>
        <p><strong>Swivl <br />
        </strong>These guys brought out the voters in droves. A clever idea, Swivl is a simple iPhone dock that can swivel to track your movements as you talk and walk about. The secret sauce is a green dot that you wear so that the base can always find you.</p>
        <p><strong>Basis <br />
        </strong>This is the year of body monitoring and Basis does it like no other. The newest of the breed, Basis not only measures your exercise, but measures everything from body temperature to sweat. Put it on and forget about it, Basis knows when you are sleeping and when you are awake.</p>

        <span class="smallText">Jan 13, 2012 09:53:43</span>
        
        
        <p>Executives from business, government, entertainment, automotive, consumer electronics and every major industry converged on the 2012 International CES to experience new ways of doing business at the world’s largest consumer technology tradeshow. Owned and produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, the <a  href="http://www.CESweb.org">2012 International CES</a> concluded today in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
        <p><strong>2012 CES Grows<br />
        </strong>The <a  href="http://www.CESweb.org">2012 International CES</a> was the largest in the event’s 44-year history, with a record number of more than <a  href="http://ces12.mapyourshow.com/5_0/search.cfm?">3,100 exhibitors</a> across the largest <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/by-hall.asp">show floor</a> in CES history – 1.861 million net square feet of exhibit space – and drawing a record of more than 153,000 attendees, including more than 34,000 international attendees. More than 20,000 new products were launched at the 2012 CES, which also featured top executives participating in <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp">keynote sessions</a>, including those from Qualcomm, Mercedes, Wal-Mart, Intel, Ford, Verizon, Unilver, Ford, eBay, GE, Google and Facebook. Executive delegations from thousands of global companies, from Apple to Zeo, attended the 2012 CES to meet with current and future customers.</p>
        <p><a  target="_blank" href="http://www.ce.org">CEA</a> is currently reviewing requests for 2013 CES keynotes and will be making announcements in the coming months. In addition, the 2013 International CES is already generating significant interest as space selection for next year’s show began this week. For example, 95,000 square feet of exhibit space in the 2013 CES iLounge Pavilion has already sold, and Mazda and BMW have committed to 2013 CES exhibit space along with Ford, Kia, Audi, Mazda and Hyundai, creating an even larger Apple-related product and automotive presence at the 2013 CES.</p>
        <p><strong>2012 CES Excites <br />

        <p><strong>2012 CES Exhibitor Quotes <br />
        </strong>“I was able to do a year’s worth of meetings in two days because CES is the one place, one show, at which ‘everyone’ attends. There is no more efficient way to get high level meetings with a broad section of companies within the CE ecosystem.” Dave Hagan, President and CEO, Boingo Wireless </p>
        <p>“CES is unparalleled in its ability to bring together, in one place, all the folks we need to see to grow our business. I met with CE manufacturers and retailers, chip and handset makers, radio broadcasters, regulators, automakers, press and financial analysts, all in the space of a few days. It’s supercharged productivity.” Bob Struble, CEO, iBiquity Digital Corporation </p>
        <p>“We are witnessing the promised road of convergence with CES as the ringleader. Devices are talking and many different industries are listening, beyond electronics: media and Internet, energy and utilities, telecommunications, automotive, health and wellbeing companies are migrating to this show. Truly a social media of connected devices is forming, with CES ‘friending’ industries.” Scott Burnett, Managing Director, IBM </p>
        <p>CEA conducts an independent audit of attendance at the International CES and verified figures will be available in the spring.

        <div class="sub-content-header">2012 International CES Sets Show Record at 1.86 Million Net Square Feet of Exhibit Space</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 12, 2012 10:27:47</span>
        
        <P>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)® announced today that the 2012 International CES® is the largest in the show's 44 year history, with 1.861 million net square feet of exhibit space. The previous record was 1.857 million net square feet of space at the 2008 International CES. Owned and produced by CEA, the 2012 International CES, the world's largest tradeshow for consumer technology, runs through Friday, January 13 in Las Vegas, Nevada. </P>
<P>In other show news, a keynote address by Ericsson's Hans Vestberg, the Innovation Power Panel with leaders from Ford, Verizon and Xerox, a Brand keynote from executives from AT&amp;T, Walmart, Facebook and GE, an LIT keynote from eBay's John Donohue and a keynote from YouTube's Robert Kyncl were mid-week highlights of the 2012 International CES®. </P>
<P>The Innovation Power Panel on Wednesday morning featured Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally, Xerox Chairman and CEO Ursula Burns and Verizon Enterprise Solutions President John Stratton. The panelists discussed how innovation must be a strategy for their respective companies and for the United States. The conversation centered on how to stimulate innovation through investment and employment. </P>
<P>In his 2012 CES keynote, Hans Vestberg, President and CEO of Ericsson, discussed "The Networked Society" connecting everyone and everything through mobility. "We have a responsibility to build networks that can carry innovation," said Vestberg. Ericsson predicts there will be 50 billion connected devices worldwide by 2020. </P>
<P>The CES Brand keynote panel featured the marketing minds of the world's top brands. The retail and branding effects of social media, healthcare-related technologies, connectivity and the explosion of wireless were all discussed during the session. The panelists agreed that people are becoming more connected to their devices, and because of this, to each other. “Our core belief is that the entire web is being rebuilt around people,” said Facebook's Vice President of Global Marketing Solutions Carolyn Everson. </P>
<P>In an afternoon SuperSession with CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski stressed the importance of broadband, particularly wireless, in the future of consumer electronics. "The demand for spectrum has grown because people love these products," said Genachowski, stressing the need for Congress to pass incentive spectrum auction legislation. "We need to get it done now." <BR>After touring the show floor, Genachowski noted the "endless rows of innovative new products," addressing fitness, education and healthcare, among other purposes. The session also covered net neutrality, antitrust issues and Genachowski's broadband-driven agenda at the FCC. </P>
<P>Wednesday's SuperSession with Brian Dunn, CEO of Best Buy, and CEA's Shapiro talked about hot selling products this holiday season and the retailer's strategy. "We'll have more doors and less square footage," Dunn told Shapiro in a question and answer session. "Stores have an important place in the ecosystem." When it comes to product trends, Dunn expects tablets and smartphones to stay hot while he opined that it was the "best time in the history of man to buy a TV." </P>
<P>Bringing the digital lifestyle safely into the car was the main topic at Wednesday SuperSession, “Connect2Car: Connecting Automotive and Consumer Electronics Lifestyles.” Several main trends were discussed including, driving green, driving connected, driving safe and driving cool. The panel agreed that collaboration is the key, when integrating apps and other technology into the car. </P>
<P>The Verge's Joshua Topolsky moderated an “Argue the Future” SuperSession on Wednesday that featured Drew Bamford of&nbsp; HTC, Ryan Bidan of Samsung, Nilay Patel of The Verge and Aaron Woodman of Microsoft. The participants debated the challenges of differentiation versus commodization, the goal of launching less phones but more consumer choice, perhaps by offering hardware customization options, and the best ways to curate and deliver personal content to the cloud. </P>
<P>On Wednesday evening, John Donahoe, president and CEO of eBay, delivered the keynote address at the Leaders in Technology (LIT) dinner. Donahoe discussed how the intersection of technology and retail is having a profound impact on consumers' shopping experience and predicted that the next three years of "shopping and paying" will see more profound change then what we've seen over the past 10-15 years. </P>
<P>Thursday morning featured a keynote from Robert Kyncl, Vice President of Global Content Partnerships, YouTube. Kyncl described how content, distribution and marketing of video have come together to make it a transformative and accessible viewing option around the world. According to Kyncl, by 2020, 75 percent of all channels will be transmitted or born on the Internet, due to closed systems that have no opened up. </P>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Keynotes from Qualcomm, Mercedes and Intel and Major Innovation Launch 2012 International CES</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 11, 2012 05:13:06</span>
        
        
        <p>Major product launches from more than 3,100 exhibitors and keynotes from the leaders of Qualcomm, Mercedes and Intel launched the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp#Steve-Ballmer">2012 International CES</a> on Tuesday. Owned and produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the 2012 International CES, the world's largest tradeshow for consumer technology, runs through Friday, January 13 in Las Vegas, Nevada. </p>
        <p>Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, delivered a State of the CE Industry address Tuesday morning. Shapiro projected that the U.S. consumer electronics industry will increase by 3.7 percent in 2012, exceeding $202 billion, and global spending on consumer technology devices will surpass $1 trillion in 2012. Shapiro cited innovation as the key to global industry and economic growth.</p>
        <p>"The cause of innovation is closely linked to the most important issue of our day – the health of the global economy,” said Shapiro. "We can't escape the news that many countries face tough economic times from government over-spending. These nations have three options for recovery: raise taxes, cut spending or grow the economy. Of these three, growth is the best path. Growth is the quest and it comes only from innovation.”</p>
        <p>Qualcomm's Dr. Paul Jacobs delivered the opening <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp#Steve-Ballmer">2012 CES keynote</a> Tuesday, as part of the Technology and Developing Countries Program (TEC). Jacobs announced that the mobile market will soon reach $1.3 trillion and discussed ways that mobile platforms are improving lives, including a mobile microfinance program for impoverished women in Indonesia. During his address, Jacobs introduced Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor, the first all-in-one processor to hit the market. Joined on stage with Nokia's Stephen Elop, Jacobs announced that every Windows phone will be powered with Snapdragon processors. Jacobs also introduced Lenovo's Liu Jun, who announced the company's first Smart TV to be powered by Snapdragon.</p>
        <p>During the Tuesday afternoon <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp#Steve-Ballmer">keynote</a>, Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, took the stage to highlight Mercedes-Benz's innovation inside the vehicle. Zetsche discussed connectivity in the car and how the digital lifestyle extends to the "digital drive style.” Mercedes-Benz announced its Declaration of Automotive Independence, which calls for the freedom of time, freedom of speech, freedom of access, freedom of energy and freedom of information. "With this declaration, the best days of driving are still ahead,” said Zetsche. "Mercedes-Benz is making cars safer, smarter and more efficient, not to mention more fun to drive.”</p>
        <p>Zetsche also highlighted their Car2Go service, a car sharing program featuring electric vehicles. The service will add twelve new cities in 2012 as well as Car2gether, a secure social network for the road.</p>
        <p>Tuesday morning's <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/conferenceProgram/SuperSessions.asp">SuperSession</a>, "Spotlight on 3D Content,” addressed the top challenges in the 3D content industry. The panel, consisting of executives from ESPN, 3net, Cameron Pace group and HBO, discussed exciting plans for bringing a plethora of 3D content to the home this year. ESPN's Bryan Burns began by noting, "the 3D seeds we have planted are really starting to sprout," an idea support by all the panelists. Other topics of discussion included new technologies being developed to help capture 3D and the decreasing price of 3D sets as a driver for market growth.</p>
        <p>In Tuesday's "IP&amp;TV World Forum” SuperSession Giles Cottle of Informa Telecoms &amp; Media discussed ways that TVs have been evolving given the rise of the connect television. Panelists from Sony Networked Entertainment, Cox Communications, YouTube and AT&amp;T discussed how content providers and device creators can work together to provide the content consumers want on their TV through a singular and seamless platform. The panelists also noted the growth in social TV and how it can provide a more integrative and valued experience for users.</p>
        <p>CNET's Brian Cooley and Molly Wood moderated the standing room only "Next Big Thing" SuperSession that featured Tim Baxter of Samsung Electronics America, Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, Blake Krikorian of id8 Group and Sling Media and Eric Schmidt of Google. The session featured an energetic discussion about how Google has delivered on openness to allow for product differentiation. The panel was optimistic on the innovation ahead as developers leverage Android's open API to create even more connected devices.</p>
        <p>In Tuesday afternoon's closing keynote, Intel President and CEO Dr. Paul Otellini spoke of "transistors transforming people's lives.” A number of Intel-based products were announced, including the Intel-based Lenovo K800, a smartphone coming to market later this year. Intel processors will also be featured in a number of devices from Motorola Mobility thanks to a new multi-year, multi-device partnership.</p>
        <p>Intel demonstrated the power of its new 22 nanometer, a three-dimensional transistor technology named "Ivy Bridge.” Otellini told attendees, "Moore's Law isn't about science, it's about man's drive to innovate.” The Intel-based Ultrabook category received yet a new member with the announcement of the XPS 13 Ultrabook by Dell's Vice Chairman Jeff Clark. The 11-inch Ultrabook is 6mm at its thinnest, and features a carbon fiber base allowing it to weigh under three pounds.</p>
