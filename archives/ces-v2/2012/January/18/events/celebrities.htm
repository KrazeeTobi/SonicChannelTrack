        <h3>Dennis Rodman </h3>
        <p><strong><a  href="http://ces12.mapyourshow.com/5_0/exhibitor_details.cfm?exhid=T0009769">Paltalk </a></strong>(LVCC, South Hall, #26915)<br />
        <strong>2-3:30 p.m. Thursday, January 12<br />
        </strong>American Hall of Fame Professional Basketball player. Dennis Rodman is one of the greatest rebounders ever to play professional basketball. His rebounding exploits have drawn comparisons with such legends as Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, and Bill Russell, all of whom were taller and heavier. Sports Illustrated once called Rodman "a sort of basketball genius." A dedicated analyst of the game and a tenacious defender, Rodman led the National Basketball Association (NBA) in rebounding for four consecutive years and helped lead his teams to five NBA championships. As his career went on, however, Rodman drew ever more attention for his off-court antics. With his rainbow-colored hair and multiple tattoos, his penchant for conducting interviews in gay bars, and tumultuous romances with the singer Madonna and the actress Carmen Electra, Rodman landed headlines far outside the sports pages. </p>
