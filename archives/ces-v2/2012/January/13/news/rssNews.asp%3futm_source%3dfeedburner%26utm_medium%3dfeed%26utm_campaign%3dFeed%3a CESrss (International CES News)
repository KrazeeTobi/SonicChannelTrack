        <p>Bags to Go enables you to check-in your luggage through to your final destination and also gives you the option of printing your boarding pass in advance. To take advantage of this service you must check luggage three hours prior to your flight and have an e-ticket. This service is available for Delta, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways or Virgin Atlantic. All participating airlines now only charge a fee of $10 per person per bags instead of $20. Additional airline fees may still apply for additional, excess, overweight, and oversized bags. Please check with your airline for their current baggage handling policy. Note, Venetian/Palazzo and MGM Grand Bags to Go locations do not service United airlines.<br />
        <br />
        At the LVCC, Bags to Go is located in the Grand Concourse, across from Central Hall 3. At The Venetian and Palazzo, Bags to Go is located in each hotel front desk area. At the Luxor, Bags to Go is located in the lower lobby West Tower near VIP check-in. At MGM Grand, Bags to Go is located in the main lobby. This service is also available in the lobby of the McCarran airport Rent-A-Car center.</p>

        <span class="smallText">Jan 11, 2012 05:13:06</span>
        
        
        <p>Major product launches from more than 3,100 exhibitors and keynotes from the leaders of Qualcomm, Mercedes and Intel launched the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp#Steve-Ballmer">2012 International CES</a> on Tuesday. Owned and produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the 2012 International CES, the world's largest tradeshow for consumer technology, runs through Friday, January 13 in Las Vegas, Nevada. </p>
        <p>Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, delivered a State of the CE Industry address Tuesday morning. Shapiro projected that the U.S. consumer electronics industry will increase by 3.7 percent in 2012, exceeding $202 billion, and global spending on consumer technology devices will surpass $1 trillion in 2012. Shapiro cited innovation as the key to global industry and economic growth.</p>
        <p>"The cause of innovation is closely linked to the most important issue of our day – the health of the global economy,” said Shapiro. "We can't escape the news that many countries face tough economic times from government over-spending. These nations have three options for recovery: raise taxes, cut spending or grow the economy. Of these three, growth is the best path. Growth is the quest and it comes only from innovation.”</p>
        <p>Qualcomm's Dr. Paul Jacobs delivered the opening <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp#Steve-Ballmer">2012 CES keynote</a> Tuesday, as part of the Technology and Developing Countries Program (TEC). Jacobs announced that the mobile market will soon reach $1.3 trillion and discussed ways that mobile platforms are improving lives, including a mobile microfinance program for impoverished women in Indonesia. During his address, Jacobs introduced Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor, the first all-in-one processor to hit the market. Joined on stage with Nokia's Stephen Elop, Jacobs announced that every Windows phone will be powered with Snapdragon processors. Jacobs also introduced Lenovo's Liu Jun, who announced the company's first Smart TV to be powered by Snapdragon.</p>
        <p>During the Tuesday afternoon <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp#Steve-Ballmer">keynote</a>, Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, took the stage to highlight Mercedes-Benz's innovation inside the vehicle. Zetsche discussed connectivity in the car and how the digital lifestyle extends to the "digital drive style.” Mercedes-Benz announced its Declaration of Automotive Independence, which calls for the freedom of time, freedom of speech, freedom of access, freedom of energy and freedom of information. "With this declaration, the best days of driving are still ahead,” said Zetsche. "Mercedes-Benz is making cars safer, smarter and more efficient, not to mention more fun to drive.”</p>
        <p>Zetsche also highlighted their Car2Go service, a car sharing program featuring electric vehicles. The service will add twelve new cities in 2012 as well as Car2gether, a secure social network for the road.</p>
        <p>Tuesday morning's <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/conferenceProgram/SuperSessions.asp">SuperSession</a>, "Spotlight on 3D Content,” addressed the top challenges in the 3D content industry. The panel, consisting of executives from ESPN, 3net, Cameron Pace group and HBO, discussed exciting plans for bringing a plethora of 3D content to the home this year. ESPN's Bryan Burns began by noting, "the 3D seeds we have planted are really starting to sprout," an idea support by all the panelists. Other topics of discussion included new technologies being developed to help capture 3D and the decreasing price of 3D sets as a driver for market growth.</p>
        <p>In Tuesday's "IP&amp;TV World Forum” SuperSession Giles Cottle of Informa Telecoms &amp; Media discussed ways that TVs have been evolving given the rise of the connect television. Panelists from Sony Networked Entertainment, Cox Communications, YouTube and AT&amp;T discussed how content providers and device creators can work together to provide the content consumers want on their TV through a singular and seamless platform. The panelists also noted the growth in social TV and how it can provide a more integrative and valued experience for users.</p>
        <p>CNET's Brian Cooley and Molly Wood moderated the standing room only "Next Big Thing" SuperSession that featured Tim Baxter of Samsung Electronics America, Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, Blake Krikorian of id8 Group and Sling Media and Eric Schmidt of Google. The session featured an energetic discussion about how Google has delivered on openness to allow for product differentiation. The panel was optimistic on the innovation ahead as developers leverage Android's open API to create even more connected devices.</p>
        <p>In Tuesday afternoon's closing keynote, Intel President and CEO Dr. Paul Otellini spoke of "transistors transforming people's lives.” A number of Intel-based products were announced, including the Intel-based Lenovo K800, a smartphone coming to market later this year. Intel processors will also be featured in a number of devices from Motorola Mobility thanks to a new multi-year, multi-device partnership.</p>
        <p>Intel demonstrated the power of its new 22 nanometer, a three-dimensional transistor technology named "Ivy Bridge.” Otellini told attendees, "Moore's Law isn't about science, it's about man's drive to innovate.” The Intel-based Ultrabook category received yet a new member with the announcement of the XPS 13 Ultrabook by Dell's Vice Chairman Jeff Clark. The 11-inch Ultrabook is 6mm at its thinnest, and features a carbon fiber base allowing it to weigh under three pounds.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Best-Selling Blueprint for Economic Recovery: The Comeback Now Available as Audio Book</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 10, 2012 04:45:31</span>
        
        
        <p>On the first day of the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org">2012 International CES</a>, Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) President and CEO Gary Shapiro announced that his New York Times best-selling book, The Comeback: How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream, is now available in audio book format. The unabridged recording of The Comeback, narrated by Jack Roberts, is available for download immediately from major audio book retailers <a  href="http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_15?asin=B006VI2HB0&qid=1326211887&sr=1-15">Audible</a>, <a  href="http://amblingbooks.com/books/view/the_comeback_2">Ambling Books </a>and <a  href="https://securemail.ce.org/owa/redir.aspx?C=c1f0f42caafb43cca23c00784d62d701&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.learnoutloud.com%2fAudio-Books%2fPolitics%2fPolitical-Philosophy%2fThe-Comeback%2f43064">Learn Out Loud</a>. It is coming soon to iTunes.</p>
        <p>The Comeback lays out a clear path to economic recovery built on an innovation agenda. It was released in print at the 2011 International CES, debuted at No. 7 on the New York Times best-seller list, and became a best-seller at Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon.com, Publishers Weekly, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Shapiro’s no-nonsense, nonpartisan, comprehensive innovation agenda earned praise from all corners, including businessmen, elected officials and activists.</p>
        <p>“The International CES illustrates the incredibly influential role America’s innovators and entrepreneurs play in driving our country’s economic success,” Shapiro said. “Innovation allows us to invent entirely new industries, creates good jobs and opens up new markets to American goods. It’s time our federal government pursued a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation, as laid out in The Comeback.</p>
        <p>“Since we released The Comeback at the 2011 International CES, people have been asking for an audio book version.” Shapiro added. “CES is all about empowering people to utilize technology however they want, so this was a perfect time to finally make the audio book available. Americans are still hungry for decisive action to fix our economy, and the national strategic plan laid out in The Comeback is still meeting that need.”</p>
        <p>By returning innovation to its rightful place at the center of America’s economic policy, Shapiro shows that there is hope for America’s economic future, but it will require sacrifice and strategic thinking. In particular, some of the tough policy choices Shapiro says U.S. lawmakers must pursue include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reforming immigration laws to ensure the world’s best and brightest come to and stay in America.</li>
            <li>Opening American products to world markets by finalizing, expanding, and creating free-trade agreements.</li>
            <li>Releasing more spectrum for wireless broadband.</li>
            <li>Reducing litigation, encouraging investment rather than debt, improving education and supporting America’s best companies.</li>
            <li>Drastically reducing the deficit through triage, smarter tax collection, and economic growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>High Praise for The Comeback:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>“Informative, sobering, and at times frustrating, The Comeback is that rare breed of book that actually delivers on what it promises: A way forward.” <br />
            – Steve Forbes, President and CEO of Forbes and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes magazine</li>
            <li>“By working together in public/private partnerships, we all can deliver on the compelling vision Gary Shapiro details for innovation and economic growth based on creating the products people really want and value.” <br />
            – Alan Mulally, CEO, Ford Motor Company</li>
            <li>“Our nation is facing a major crossroad and we need a new strategy to excite our people. Throughout his career, Shapiro has always understood the role of innovation in business; he is right that we can only preserve the American Dream by doing what we do best – doing things better.” <br />
            – Ivan Seidenberg, Chairman and CEO, Verizon Communications</li>
            <li>“We cannot afford to allow our nation to fall further behind in the race to create innovation and save our American Dream. Gary offers a gripping story that is a road map to American success.” <br />
            – Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Chairman, House Government Oversight and Reform Committee</li>
            <li>“The Comeback is exactly the kind of forward-thinking economic strategy that America lacks right now. This should be required reading for everyone in Washington. What Shapiro has done is deliver an honest, tough assessment of the nation’s precarious economic situation. You won’t agree with every solution he offers, but we ignore his advice to our peril.” <br />
            – Grover Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="smallText">Jan 09, 2012 08:21:11</span>
        
        
        <p><a  target="_blank" href="http://www.ce.org">The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)</a>, owner and producer of the <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org">International CES</a>, today announced a total of $75,000 in donations to Green Chips and Repurpose AMERICA, local Las Vegas nonprofit organizations advancing clean energy and minimizing waste.</p>
        <p>“CES is committed to sustainability, and we are extremely proud that these donations will help the environment and the Las Vegas community through the efforts of Green Chips and Repurpose AMERICA,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA. “CES is a tremendously successful event thanks to the great people and facilities of Las Vegas, and we’re pleased to make this investment in sustainability to demonstrate our commitment to this great city.”</p>
        <p><a  target="_blank" href="http://www.greenchips.org">Green Chips</a>, a local charity supporting sustainable initiatives including solar panel installations, plans to use its $50,000 donation to help retrofit the Las Vegas Rescue Mission for solar panels. With more than 300 days of sunshine per year in Las Vegas, the Rescue Mission’s solar panels will significantly reduce its energy bills while using clean energy. Last year, with the assistance of a CEA donation, Green Chips helped with a solar panel installation at a local Salvation Army, leading to $7,000 in projected annual energy savings.</p>
        <p>“CEA’s generosity in making this award to Green Chips will make a lasting impact on the Las Vegas community for years to come,” said Green Chips Chair Cindy Ortega. “The promotion of social, economic and environmental sustainability efforts in Southern Nevada is the primary mission of Green Chips, and it aligns with CEA’s commitment to sustainability. We are honored to again be the recipient of this award, and to help ensure that its positive benefits on the community are maximized.”</p>
        <p>In an unprecedented effort to minimize waste from the 2011 International CES, the world’s largest consumer technology show, CEA, Global Experience Specialists (GES) and <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.repurposeamerica.org">Repurpose AMERICA</a> collaborated to capture and reuse about 18,000 pounds of magnetic signs, nearly 15,000 square feet of banner signs and more than 150 foam boards (three feet by eight feet).</p>
        <p>This year at CES, CEA will issue second life badge holders made from repurposed signs from last year’s CES, plus signs from other shows. The badge holders used nearly 24,000 square feet of repurposed vinyl signs.</p>
        <p>CEA will be working again with Repurpose AMERICA and GES this year to maximize the reuse of show materials. As part of that effort, CEA has granted Repurpose AMERICA $25,000 to take signs and other materials from CES to build shade structures at two local community centers.</p>
        <p>“Repurposing signs from the biggest tradeshow in the Americas to help create much-needed shade structures at community institutions is a innovative sustainability solution that CEA and Repurpose AMERICA have pioneered,” said Zach Delbex, CEO of Repurpose AMERICA. “We are proud to continue working with CEA and are honored to accept this donation. It will make a difference in Las Vegas.”</p>

        <p>If you missed the advance registration deadline, don’t worry – you can register on-site at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC). <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/faq/generalFAQs.asp#regbadges">See on-site registration dates, locations and times.</a> <br />
        <br />
        Already received your badge in the mail? That’s great. In addition, each registrant who receives a badge by mail will need to go to a badge holder pickup location on-site to get their official 2012 International CES badge holder. Admittance without a badge holder is not permitted. International CES is a trade-only show and is not open to the general public. Therefore, we must ensure all attendees are industry affiliates before issuing a badge holder. After the show, CES performs an official attendance audit through an outside auditing firm, and the on-site badge holder pickup process serves as a method for counting attendance.</p>
        <p>Two forms of identification are required to pick up your badge holder: <br />
        One personal picture ID such as a driver's license or passport. <br />
        One business ID such as a business card, pay stub or statement on company letterhead indicating that you are representing that company at International CES.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">2012 International CES on Track to be Best in CES History</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 09, 2012 04:07:10</span>
        
        <P>With more than 100 products introduced at the CES Unveiled event last night and press day opening today, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)® announces that the 2012 International CES will be the association's second largest show in history when show floor opens on Tuesday. For a sneak peek at the show floor before it opens, visit CES's YouTube channel and for a look at the innovation from CES Unveiled, click here. </P>
<P>The 1.851 million net square feet of show floor will open tomorrow, as more than 2,700 companies debut the next generation of innovative products across all sectors of the consumer electronics industry. The 2011 show welcomed 149,529 technology attendees and spanned more than 1.6 million net square feet of exhibit space. The largest CES was in 2008, with a record-breaking 1.857 million net square feet of exhibit space. </P>
<P>CES is the global stage for innovation," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. "Every major technology company across the globe is participating in force at this year's CES. While many exhibit on the show floor, others send key executives to conduct meetings, participate in keynote panels, or hold their own events in Las Vegas this week to take advantage of the braintrust of technology professionals gathered here." In addition to the 2,700 exhibitors at this year's show, every major tech company, including Apple, Facebook, Twitter, HP and Dell, is sending significant delegations to CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow. <BR>CEA expects this year's CES will be the most innovative show on record, with more than 20,000 new products slated to be announced this week. While the doors to the 2012 CES show floor officially open on Tuesday, news has already started to leak highlighting new innovations and products before many of these companies have even held their press conferences: </P>

        <p>Next week, as it does early each year, the world epicenter of innovation becomes Las Vegas in the form of International CES, the world’s largest consumer technology tradeshow. More than 2,700 companies display their best ideas to more than 140,000 visitors – reporters, buyers, investors and potential business partners – in several cavernous exhibit halls and hotels. No matter the reason, everyone who attends International CES has chosen to invest precious time and money. Their return is more than entertainment; it is business – and an awesome and inspiring display of the future.</p>
        <p>They travel great distances to meet like-minded individuals and discuss the vibrancy, hope and promise of innovation. They come because in no other venue can a company make a profoundly physical statement to 5,000 reporters and analysts, and some 30,000 international business visitors. Yet the distances any one attendee travels to CES pales in comparison to what they would have to travel otherwise to accomplish the same business meetings: the average CES attendee has 12 meetings at the show, which means CES attendees save more than 700 million miles of flight in business trips that they otherwise would have to take.</p>
        <p>They come to test the mettle of the people with whom they are doing business, to shake their hands, look in their eyes, and assess whether a company’s product matches a company’s hype. Perhaps most important, they come because relationships matter in business and, despite the worldwide reach of the Internet, a relationship cannot only be electronic. It must be personal.</p>
        <p>This personal component to International CES – or any tradeshow, for that matter – is what makes it a living, breathing entity. It’s an experience that requires five senses. Some may scoff and wonder why in the age of technology and the Internet live face-to-face events even exist. Yet they not only persist, they also prosper because people, relationships and first-hand impressions matter. Five-sense interaction beats the Internet for creating a big picture view, allowing serendipitous discovery, developing trust, and evaluating people and products.</p>
        <p>Bill Gates once told me that Microsoft was made by trade shows like CES. Indeed, every large company started as a small company that needed to attract investors, partners and customers quickly and efficiently. The best place to accomplish all three? At a tradeshow. Indeed, the entire CES is run with a basic principle: that anyone with an idea should be able to present it inexpensively. Companies and careers have been made at trade shows – and our world has been changed by them as well.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, which owns and produces CES, has a long line of volunteer chairmen whose companies got their big break at CES. Kathy Gornik, the co-founder of Thiel Audio, packed four days of food before driving to her first CES in 1976. Darrell Issa, now a member of Congress, built his car security company by attending CES shows, as did Loyd Ivey, who started MTX Audio in 1976 at the age of 26, and now operates the mega-company MTI. These giants of industry began as CES presenters who shared a passion for innovation and entrepreneurship and the belief that anyone with an idea should be able to expose it easily. Their leadership helped protect a sacred trust that CES must always serve as a platform for new innovators and entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>So we keep the flame lit. This year, CES added <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/techzones.asp#Eureka-Park">Eureka Park</a>, which will provide almost 100 start-ups a special exhibition at the show. Since 2010 we have tripled the iLounge Pavilion space for third-party accessories and software for Apple’s iPod, iPhone and iPad products to 300 exhibitors.</p>
        <p>Of course, CES isn’t the only event around. We also see tremendous innovation at other major U.S. trade shows, including AAPEX, BIO, CEDIA, CTIA, IMTS, InfoComm, ISC, NAB, NAMM, Pack Expo and SEMA. While these may seem to be indecipherable acronyms, each represents an event attracting thousands of businesses coming to see hundreds of cutting edge innovative exhibitors. These and other events are carrying our economy, creating jobs, making news, driving marketing and pushing us rapidly into the future.</p>
        <p>Marketing executives at businesses across industry sectors understand the value of tradeshows. In a recent study conducted by the nonprofit organization Center for Exhibition Industry Research Foundation (CEIR), 99 percent of surveyed executives said exhibiting offers unique value not offered by other marketing channels. Business executives understand tradeshows’ importance, because exhibitions drive business. In another CEIR study conducted by Oxford Economics in 2010, findings uncover that each of the top exhibitions in the United States created, on average, $82 million in business-to-business sales among exhibitors and attendees.</p>
        <p>The U.S. business-to-business exhibition industry is alive and well, and it offers companies a gateway to reaching their markets. The 2010 CEIR Census documents that there are approximately 9,000 business-to-business exhibitions in the United States. The CEIR Index estimates that approximately 1.5 million companies exhibited in 2011 and roughly 60 million people attended.</p>
        <p>The power and purpose of tradeshows in our rapidly connected world continue to grow with each year. Far from being a relic of a bygone age, today’s trade show remains the premier event to learn, interact and maybe even strike a deal with America’s next generation of innovators. So get on a plane. Go to a tradeshow. Think outside the box. Be open to new ideas. And have a bit of fun along the way.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Eureka Park TechZone Triples Since Launch</div>
        <span class="smallText">Dec 21, 2011 10:33:50</span>
        
        
        Ninety-four companies will exhibit in the new Eureka Park TechZone at the 2012 International CES, a dedicated area in partnership with the National Science Foundation, Startup America Partnership, CNET and UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), showcasing innovative start-ups and entrepreneurs. Owned and produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, the 2012 International CES®, the world’s largest tradeshow for consumer technology, is scheduled January 10-13, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br />
        <br />
        “Entrepreneurship is a driving force in today’s economy, and exhibiting at CES is a great way for growing companies to gain recognition in the CE industry,” said Karen Chupka, senior vice president, events and conferences, CEA. “We are thrilled to see the overwhelming response from companies interested in exhibiting within the Eureka Park TechZone since its initial launch in June. This new area at the 2012 CES will be a must-see for CES attendees.”<br />
        <br />
        The Eureka Park TechZone, located in <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/by-hall.asp">The Venetian</a>, launched in June 2011 with 28 companies signed on to exhibit. The area has since grown to include 94 companies, spanning more than 9,000 net square feet of exhibit space.<br />
        <br />
        <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/techzones.asp#Eureka-Park">The Eureka Park TechZone</a> is designed to benefit budding entrepreneurs, fledgling start-ups, home grown innovation and small companies looking to gain footing in the consumer electronics industry. The Venetian will also feature CES keynotes and the Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase, as well as Eureka Park, a hot spot for venture capitalists, investors, media and more than 140,000 industry professionals looking for the next big thing in technology.<br />
        <br />
        In November, UKTI hosted a competition at its event, TechWorld, with the top three innovative companies awarded space within the Eureka Park TechZone at the 2012 CES. Winners included UK-based Blippar, Stereo Grafix and Yoskhi, which will be among the 94 companies exhibiting within Eureka Park.<br />
        <br />
        CEA recently announced its collaboration with the Startup America Partnership, an independent nonprofit entity launched at the White House in 2011 to help young companies succeed in order to accelerate job growth in America. Several Startup America Firms will exhibit in Eureka Park.<br />
        <br />
        The 2012 CES will feature <a  href="/showFloor/techzones.asp">more than 25 market-specific TechZones</a> covering product categories such as broadband services, safe driving and sustainable technologies. Companies interested in exhibiting in the Eureka Park TechZone should contact Kristen Nafziger at knafzgier@CE.org or 703-907-7648.

        <div class="sub-content-header">Sustainability Efforts Ramp Up for 2012 International CES</div>
        <span class="smallText">Dec 19, 2011 01:53:33</span>
        
        
        <p>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), owner and producer of the 2012 International CES, announced the adoption of several new sustainability practices at the 2012 CES, the world’s largest technology tradeshow, to be held in Las Vegas January 10-13.<br />
        <br />
        New this year, attendee badge holders are made from repurposed vinyl show banners from last year’s show, and CEA will collect those badge holders at the end of the 2012 CES to recycle them again. Furthermore, CES general services contractor Global Experience Specialists (GES) will produce signs using a reusable, recyclable kraft paper honeycomb material. CEA will also seek to collect even more magnetic, vinyl and cardboard show signs for repurposing through a partnership with Repurpose America, a local nonprofit focusing on tradeshow recycling.<br />
        <br />
        Last year, Repurpose America collected roughly 18,000 pounds of magnetic signs from the 2011 CES, nearly 15,000 square feet of vinyl banners and more than 150 foam boards. In addition, CEA worked with contractors to recycle 289.6 tons of the solid waste generated at CES and increased the event’s recycle rate from 68 percent to 77 percent, several points higher than the average recycle rate of trade shows held at the Las Vegas Convention Center.<br />
        <br />
        “Our green and recycling efforts at the 2012 International CES are unprecedented for the largest annual event in the western hemisphere, covering more than 1.8 million square feet and welcoming more than140,000 attendees,” said Gary Shapiro, CEA president and CEO. “We’ve worked hard to ensure that we are using the latest and greatest sustainability practices in producing CES.”<br />
        <br />
        Along with the greening of the International CES, CEA also supports local green nonprofits. Last year, CEA gave $75,000 to Green Chips, a local Las Vegas charity supporting solar power installations. That money was used to install solar panels at a Las Vegas non-profit facility, resulting in substantial savings that allowed the organization to devote more money to serve those in need. CEA plans to make another donation benefiting Las Vegas and the environment at the 2012 International CES.<br />
        <br />
        The International CES also allows attendees to reduce their carbon footprint by gathering in one location. With each attendee reporting an average of 12 business meetings per CES, CES participants collectively avoid more than 960 million miles in business trips that they otherwise would have to take. As a result of attending CES and consolidating trips, the estimated net savings in travel is more than 549 million miles.<br />
        <br />
