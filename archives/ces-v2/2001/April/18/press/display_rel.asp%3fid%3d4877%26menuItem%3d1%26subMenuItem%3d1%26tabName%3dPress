	<td><font class="pressReleaseBody"><title>Digital Technology Captures Blow-Out CES</title>Industry professionals from around the globe - 126,818 total - saw the most cutting-edge digital technology from 2,205 exhibitors at the 2000 International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology.  As the world's largest annual technology tradeshow with 1.125 million net square feet of exhibits, the 2000 International CES showcased digital content, delivery and hardware technology for the new millennium-everything from information appliances, Internet access devices, digital audio and video, information technology, home networking, mobile electronics, wireless communications, content media, e-commerce and accessory products. 

<p>

"We projected this would be our biggest CES ever, and it was.  We had more exhibitors, more exhibit floor space and more attendees than in the 34-year history of CES," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the sponsor, producer and manager of CES.  "More than 100 countries attended this year, bringing manufacturers, retailers, content providers and creators, broadband developers, installers, engineers, corporate buyers, government leaders, financial analysts and the media from around the world to experience and learn about the latest in workstyle and lifestyle technology."

<p>

Attendance was up an amazing 30 percent over 1999's record of 97,525.  Independently audited attendance numbers for the 2000 International CES will be released later this spring.

<p>

"CES gave attendees glimpses into the future of the networked world-where devices can easily communicate with each other to make life and work more enjoyable and less complicated," said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president.  "This networked world will be made possible by new digital technology used in audio, video, computing, telephony and integrated systems for the home, office and road."

<p>

Beyond the expansive exhibit floor, the 2000 CES had more than 130 jammed-packed sessions to help attendees discover new profit opportunities and business models.  Some of leading industry visionaries spoke at these sessions, including:
