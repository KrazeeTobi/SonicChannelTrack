<font class="subhead"><a href="#car">Digital Car</a></font><br>
As today’s vehicles evolve into entertainment and information centers, drivers are enjoying improved audio, 
video, GPS navigation and Internet connectivity. CES is the place to see the new in-car entertainment systems 
and, in conference sessions, hear how to sell new products while keeping drivers safe.<p>

<font class="subhead"><a href="#dtv">Digital Television (DTV)</a></font><br>
Two years into the transition to digital television-the high quality picture that shows exquisite details and 
color-the growing number of DTV owners shows that DTV is here to stay. Sales are up and progress continues on 
producing more content.<p>

<font class="subhead"><a href="#broad">Broadband</a></font><br>

More service and faster connections-that’s what broadband offers to consumers linking to the Internet. High-speed 
data services and bundles of video, voice and data are opening new market opportunities, including video phones, 
multimedia advertising and virtual real estate shopping.<p>


<font class="subhead"><a href="#digitalradio">Digital Radio</a></font><br>
The digital radio revolution gives American drivers more choices in their cars, including listening to a hometown 
sports station from a thousand miles away. Receivers for digital satellite radio and digital terrestrial radio are 
becoming available this year, and interest is riding high.	<p>

<font class="subhead"><a href="#bluetooth">Bluetooth and Wireless</a></font><br>
Bluetooth enables dozens of wireless products to talk to each other easily, and that success signals a powerful 
change in workstyles and lifestyles. Bluetooth is helping to create a robust wireless Internet and is boosting 
interest in innovative wireless electronic commerce devices. 
<p>


<font class="subhead"><a href="#set">Digital Set-Top Boxes</a></font><br>
The set-top box may become the most versatile electronic box in the home, perhaps even replacing the computer. 
Reducing cost and clutter for consumers, the set-top box could combine cable modem, interactive TV, personal 
video recorder (PVR), satellite tuners and other features. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#digitalImaging">Digital Imaging</a></font><br>
Digital video and photography are changing the way consumers can capture memories and communicate. Users can now 
view, edit, save and send images in ways that were out of reach a year ago. E-mail photos to grandma or breathe 
new life into old home movies-it’s easier than ever. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#homeNetworking">Home Networking</a></font><br>
Home networking simplifies our lives by automatically taking care of the mundane aspects of running a home, linking 
different products so they can work together (like arming the security system and setting back the thermostat or 
turning off the TV) and be controlled remotely. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#mp3">MP3 and Internet Audio</a></font><br>
Internet technology is changing the music industry forever. MP3 technology offers consumers a new way to receive 
and carry free music off the Internet, and as MP3 players shrink in size and grow in storage capacity. <p>
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#teleworking">Teleworking</a></font><br>
Shifting some office work to home is growing more common-about 10 percent of American workers now telecommute. 
Technology makes it easier, and CEA is making the knowledge about how to make teleworking successful widely available. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#dvd">DVD-Audio</a></font><br>
Digital technology is driving a revolution in the musical listening experience, as audio moves from a CD to a 
DVD-based format. DVD, the fastest selling product in the history of consumer electronics, is driving the 
surround experience. Consumers enjoy more choices in DVD players, and more players are being built into 
more components, such as VCRs and TVs. 
<p>
<font class="subhead"><a href="#pda">PDAs and Handheld Computing</a></font><br>
Today's handheld computer expands a consumer’s power to deal with work and life through such common PC functions 
as word processing, spreadsheets, games, e-mail and Web surfing. PDAs and handhelds work through a variety of 
input methods, such as keyboards, pens and voices, and usually can interface with personal computers for file 
updates and synchronization.
<p>

<a name="car"></a>
<font class="subhead">Digital Car</a></font><p>
In 2001, more drivers are adding games, movies, GPS navigation, music and e-mail access to their dashboards 
or back seat consoles. This rich product mix is evolving under the watchful eye of the Consumer Electronics 
Association, which aims to make lifestyle and workstyle simpler, while keeping the driver’s attention on the road.
<p>
Products that once featured only navigation systems (GPS) have broadened to include more information, entertainment 
and computer power. Some can play DVD videos or MP3 music files. DVD players may become standard in new vehicles 
in the United States in the next few years. Satellite radio-capable cars now offer 200 new channels from virtually 
anywhere in the United States. 
<p>
Since Americans are in their vehicles for 500 million commuter hours each week, CES targets that market by 
showcasing telematics, the convergence of wireless and GPS technology with a car’s electronics. According 
to CEA research, by 2004 a fourth of consumers will own telematics devices, which offer route guidance, 
roadside assistance and Internet access. 
<p>
When adding aftermarket electronics, installation issues have challenged the industry.  One solution is the 
Intelligent Data Bus (IDB), a way to connect in-car electronics so everything works together. At CES 2002, 
IDB will again be explored and explained.
<p>
IDB and digital wireless connectivity have changed mobile electronics, and opportunities abound for retailers to 
bring these features to consumers. Conferences at CES also will help retailers know how to select the perfect mix 
of car navigation, DVD, mobile video and MP3 products to reach both new and established customers.
<p>


<a name="dtv"></a>
<font class="subhead">Digital Television (DTV)</a></font><p>

Consumers need to witness what DTV has to offer first hand. More than 60 percent of those seeing HDTV for the first time are amazed by the superior quality and can't wait to own a set. It is hard to go back to the TV they have at home-more than half claim that once they have seen DTV quality they are unsatisfied with analog. 
<p>
Everyone who has had the opportunity to see content in high-definition can understand why consumers are impressed. The true test is whether or not consumers will buy. And seeing really is believing-nearly 80 percent of those who have visited a retailer to see or ask about DTV expect their next TV to be a DTV.
<p>
For the 4 out of 10 consumer electronics retailers who have taken the plunge and begun to sell DTV products, there have been rewards. More than half report that their sales of HDTV products have met or exceeded expectations, but that isn't the only benefit of carrying these products. Increased traffic flow thanks to the 16 million families who have visited stores so far to see or inquire about DTV promote sales of all consumer electronics products. And they keep coming back. More than half of consumers who have visited a retail store looking for DTV plan on returning in the next 3 months. 
<p>
Once buyers have a DTV set, now what? Many owners have gotten their new high-definition set home only to discover they can't take full advantage of their new investment. The lack of content currently being broadcast in high-definition has gotten many owners down. However, they are optimistic: 82 percent expect three quarters of the programs they currently watch to be broadcast in HD within two years. Until that happens, they are using their new high priced set to watch DVDs or plain old analog programming.

<a name="broad"></a>
<font class="subhead">Broadband Equals Faster Speeds, Bigger Pipes</a></font><p>
<font class="body">
If you’ve ever whiled away the time as large Internet files download, or fretted about how to share MP3 files 
and watch video more easily, then broadband may be a welcome addition to your home. Broadband is high-speed 
transmission in which a single cable can carry several channels of data at once, providing integrated access 
to voice, data, video-demand services and interactive delivery. The most common type of broadband transmission 
is cable wiring (as in cable modems) and digital subscriber lines (DSL).
<p>
Broadband gives you the ability to connect to the Internet almost instantly—turn on your computer, and you’re 
online. Websites load quickly (even with lots of graphics) and video watching becomes easier. Topping the list 
for applications for broadband is home networking, the ability to wire PCs, TVs and other devices so that they 
share resources and a single Internet connection.
<p>
A broadband connection is still a luxury—only about 5 percent of homes in the United States have broadband. 
Most people use dial-up connections, but demand is increasing for the speedy connections, with websites that 
include streaming media and other new services driving broadband demand. Another trend is the increase in 
wireless Internet use. As more people use wireless to access the Internet, demand may increase for streamlined, 
customized versions of website content.
<p>
Recent CEA research found that some consumers are interested in a high-speed connection to the Internet 
(10 times the speed of their current connection), assuming the price was a flat rate of $50 per month.
<p>
7% - Very Interested<br>
26% - Somewhat Interested<br>
66% - Not At All Interested<br>
<p>
<u>Cable, DSL Compete for Customers</u>
<p> 
The two main players in the broadband market are cable operators (for cable modem) and telephone companies 
(for digital subscriber line, or DSL). The cable industry has been rolling out cable modems across the country, 
trying to leverage their existing video relationship with the consumer to create a bundle of video, voice and 
data services. Meanwhile, telephone companies, who have a jump on the data side, are pushing DSL, a high-speed 
data technology that enables high speeds over existing phone lines. 
<p>
Each technology has its advantages and disadvantages. With cable modem, speeds are hard to predict because fat 
fiber pipes lead to neighborhood "nodes" that split into a web of spider-like cable lines. The bandwidth from 
that point is shared among the homes served by that node, so speeds depend on how many people are receiving bits 
at any given time. 
<p>
DSL services, on the other hand, are dedicated to each household, so they can deliver a particular speed. However 
DSL has trouble sending data over long distances. The FCC estimates that DSL and cable modems will have comparable 
subscriber levels by 2007.
<p>
<u>Getting Rid of Bottlenecks</u>
<p>
As broadband comes to homes, new broadband applications could spur new services, including video phones, wireless 
touchscreens, virtual real estate shopping or most anything that consumers believe may improve their lives. 
<p>
To enable broadband networking of appliances, houses built more than 20 years ago may need to run entirely new wiring 
through existing conduits. Several companies are retrofitting existing houses to make the best use of broadband 
services. Audiophiles and gamers could prove to be the biggest markets for the makers of broadband devices. People 
could network MP3 audio files throughout their houses or play video games from different rooms with other family 
members.
<p>
Several companies have jumped in to outfit homes of the future with broadband appliances and connectivity. IBM, for 
example, has been pushing its Home Director product to encourage homebuilders and homeowners to include high-speed 
data connections. Eventually, broadband connectivity may come to be thought of as an essential factor, like air 
conditioning, when considering which new home to buy. 
<p>
Broadband will be among the most talked about developments at the 2002 International CES.

<font class="subhead">Digital Radio</a></font><p>

With the introduction of two new digital technologies in 2001, American consumers soon will 
have a multitude of digital audio choices available in their cars. Expect receivers for digital 
satellite radio and digital terrestrial radio to start trickling into the U.S. marketplace in 2001. 
And if the business plans of three companies come true, the analog radio sound that has been with 
us since Pittsburgh's KDKA was licensed in the 1920s will be just a fading, fizzing, popping dream.<p>

But consumers cannot hear the crystal clear reception of local AM and FM radio and the varied 
content of national satellite radio with today's radios. Get set for the radio receiver market to 
heat up.  The first generation of these receivers will debut at CES.<p>

In the satellite arena, two companies obtained spectrum from the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) in 1997 to provide satellite digital audio radio service (SDARS). Sirius Satellite 
Radio and XM Satellite Radio expect to each beam 100 channels of digital music and talk formats 
from the stars by mid-year 2001 for coast-to coast coverage.<p>

Meanwhile, iBiquity Digital is finalizing development on a technology that will allow earthbound 
stations the opportunity to go digital. The in-band, on-channel digital audio broadcasting (iDAB) 
technology allows radio stations to simulcast digital and analog signals on the same frequency. 
Stations are expected to begin adding digital to their signals in 2001 pending the resolution of 
certain technological and regulatory hurdles. <p>

<font class="subhead">Bluetooth and Wireless</font><p>


With the next generation of mobile phones, you will be able
to surf the Web; respond to e-mail; and verify flight, hotel and rental car
information—all from your mobile phone or PDA. The technology called Bluetooth
enables users to connect computing and telecommunications devices easily
without cables. Bluetooth makes this possible through inexpensive short-range,
low power, point-to-multipoint radio frequency (RF) links. Bluetooth enables a
cell phone to take on some of the functions of a PC. 
<p>
Other wireless technologies exist, but many companies are
favoring Bluetooth. IBM is planning to put Bluetooth in all of its PC products,
for example.
<p>
Cost and functionality make Bluetooth popular. Right now,
most TV remote controls, computer laptops and Palm Pilots use an infrared
device that transmits at about 10 kilobits and only works when the device is
within line-of-sight. Bluetooth can run at 1 MB, costs little and works even
when the other device is out of the line of sight. 
<p>
Bluetooth also enjoys the support of a large number of
companies. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), comprised of close to
1,400 companies, shows close cooperation among telecommunications, computer,
automotive, medical and consumer electronics industries. 
<p>
Cahners In-Stat Group is forecasting that Bluetooth-enabled
equipment will easily exceed 200 million units by 2003 and that 670 million
Bluetooth-enabled devices will be in use by 2005. 
<p>
<b>What is Bluetooth?</b>
<br>
Bluetooth received its colorful name from King Harald Blatand (Bluetooth) a
tenth century Danish Viking who conquered many obstacles to unite his
territory. Bluetooth wireless technology is a standard for short-range radio
links between mobile PCs, wireless phones and other portable devices. 
<p>

Digital Set-Top Boxes</font><p>


The variety of new combination set-top boxes (STB) will reduce set-top clutter as well as cost, plus add entirely new functions.  Eventually the STB may ride the tide of convergence to supplant the PC as the most versatile electronic box in the home. 
<p>
WebTV, perhaps the first sign of PC/TV convergence and renamed Ultimate TV, is hardly the last. As more cable companies offer two-way broadband data service-what could be more natural than to combine a cable modem with an STB? AOL, the world's biggest e-mail and Internet service provider, just purchased cable giant Time-Warner and has launched its own interactive TV service, AOLTV. Philips has already revealed an AOLTV set-top box, and AOL also is working with DirecTV, Hughes Network Systems, TiVo and Liberate Technologies. 
<p>
A new RCA box that combines a disk-based PVR, Ultimate TV and dual-satellite tuners exemplify convergence by conglomeration. The dual-tuners allow DirecTV picture- in-picture (PIP) viewing, recording one satellite program while viewing another, or independent satellite-video feeds to two zones of a multiroom system. Satellite/cable combination boxes seem less likely, although some DBS viewers do use cable for viewing local channels. 
<p>
And while cable companies were the first to bring broadband data service to home users, the telephone companies have been aggressively marketing broadband data service via DSL. Now, they're looking to get into the television delivery service, too. Telephone companies hope to pull off video-on-demand (VOD) to anyone familiar with the narrowband sound of ordinary telephony, this seems like science fiction, but working demonstrations have been shown within the industry for the last couple of years. 
<p>
Perhaps more practical is the idea of using telephone broadband lines to deliver programming in off-peak hours to a recorder at the consumer's end. That application would require good integration with a video recorder, probably a PVR that could go in the same STB as the telco interface. 
<p>

When senior citizens with digital camcorders are merrily
sending and receiving videos of their grandchildren, you know digital imaging
is expanding in ways that were out of reach only a year or two ago. Digital
cameras and camcorders, software editing packages, and storage and printing
options offer opportunities aplenty. 
<p>
According to the Consumer Electronics Association’s (CEA)
"Digital Camera Owners Profile" survey, 80 percent of owners said
they had e-mailed a photo taken with a digital camera, 82 percent have printed
a photo and 26 percent viewed a photo on their TV. Nearly 48 percent of owners
say the main reason for purchasing a digital camera was to post pictures to a
website. Little difference was found among gender, age or income segments when
considering usage. 
<p>
Digital imaging will be among the most talked
about technologies at the 2002 International CES. Prices are coming down as
sales of digital cameras and camcorders continue to rise, and online photo
sites are attracting traditional camera users to the digital marketplace.
Consumers have become more aware of products that allow them to manipulate and
control content. Software is more powerful, hard drive capacities have
increased and the speed of processors and video graphics cards allows users to
do real-time editing on the computer.

<font class="subhead">Home Networking</font><p>


More people are equipping their houses with networked
systems that can control everything from distributing television and Internet
content to programming their alarm systems. Imagine returning home after work
and simultaneously adjusting the temperature and tuning in your favorite high
definition TV (HDTV) broadcast, all while checking your e-mail. This networked
home can be installed easily and inexpensively today. 
<p>
But you don’t have to be at home to control appliances,
lights and other devices. Logging onto a password-protected site via a Web
browser, a user can remotely check on such things while away from home.
Virtually any digital source—a DVD, a CD player or a TV—can be controlled
through a handheld remote, an LCD touchscreen or even by voice.</p>
<p>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) defines a home
network as one that facilitates communication among the appliances, home
systems, entertainment products and information devices in a home, so they can
share information. This allows users to control home systems.
The home network includes lighting, audio/video system
components, temperature control, security, telephone/communications, the
personal computer network, Internet service, utilities and power and even
controlling drapes and blinds. 
<p>
Many products now allow
  appliances, home systems and electronic devices to communicate through
  dedicated wires, wirelessly via radio frequency or through a home's existing
  wiring. 
<p>
  CEA is working on the Tech Home Rating System that will
allow homebuyers, builders and sellers to rate the technological capabilities
of a home. 
<p>
Users will increasingly demand always-on
Internet service, via digital subscriber line (DSL) service or an integrated
services digital network (ISDN) line. One of the key drivers in the connected
lifestyle is the ability to have multiple family members surfing the Net
simultaneously from different locations in the home. This means that instead of
stand-alone computers in various rooms of the house, one computer in a central
location functions as a hub. Instead of low-cost printers by each computer, a
laser printer next to the hub PC can print the kids' school projects. And
entertainment content such as music and video are among the most popular types
of content consumers would like distributed around the house, earning 59 and 47
percent respectively, according to a CEA survey in 2000.

More people are equipping their houses with a full range of networked systems that can control everything ranging from 
programming their alarm systems to setting up their heating and lighting to distributing television and Internet 
connections. 
<p>
The home networking industry has come a long way since the first remote controls and timers came onto the market about 
twenty years ago, and the industry has grown in scope to reflect this coming of age. 
Early home automation systems aimed to simplify our lives by automatically taking care of the mundane aspects of 
running a home, like turning lights on and off or putting appliances on a schedule. Integrated home systems (IHS) 
sought to link independent systems and appliances so they could work together and be controlled from other sources, 
so arming the security system could set back the thermostat for example. 
<p>
Home networking brings the power of distributed content to the home's automated and integrated systems. And the 
proliferation of digital technology in a multitude of devices promises to change the market even more dramatically.  
Just as the personal computer revolutionized the way we communicate, the home networking market could be the next phase 
of technology that changes how we live. 
<p>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) defines a home network as follows: a home network facilitates communication 
among the appliances, home systems, entertainment products and information devices in a home, so they can work 
cooperatively and share information. This allows users to get information about the home's condition and remotely 
control home systems and appliances, as well as provide access to information and entertainment resources outside the 
home. 
<p>
According to a CEA survey of 1000 consumers in April of this year, consumers share the industry's excitement about the 
future of networking digital products, as long as the information is immediately applicable to them. Entertainment 
content such as music and video are among the most popular types of content consumers would like distributed around the 
house earning 59 and 47 percent respectively.

<font class="subhead">MP3 and Internet Audio</font><p>
Last year MP3 took the country by storm. At the 2000 International CES, more than a dozen new MP3 players debuted.  MP3 technology offers consumers a new way to carry and receive free music off the Internet. MP3 technology is going to change the way music is sold and listened to forever. <p>

According to a Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) survey, 65 percent of multimedia PC households with Internet access have listened to a sound file from an Internet Web page and that number is growing daily. <p>

MP3 is an acronym for MPEG 3, which is itself an acronym for Motion Picture Expert Group-1, Audio Layer-3. MPEG defines digital video and audio data compression standards. Because they are open standards, nobody owns them, and they are available free or for a small fee. <p>

MP3 has become the commonly accepted term for one of the many compression algorithms, also known as codecs, available for downloading digital music files from the Internet. For example, MP3 can compress the size of a five-minute CD track from about 50 megabytes to five megabytes and the download time to your computer's hard drive from about two hours to ten minutes.<p>

CEA's Generation Y: Home Entertainment Market Overview found among the online segment of Gen Y (approximately 60 percent), 57 percent have played an MP3 music file. Although sound quality expectations vary, the data suggests that the majority of Gen Y listening to the MP3 format rate its sound quality as comparable to a typical stereo. <p>

In addition, the study shows that Gen Y is moving away from the traditional stereo system for listening to music. Approximately 14 percent of respondents claimed to use their PC more than a traditional stereo for listening to music. Another one in four claimed to use both with approximately the same frequency; meaning that nearly 40 percent of Generation Y is using the PC as much as or more than a stereo for listening to music. <p>

<font class="subhead">Teleworking</font><p>
As employees and organizations continue to experiment with alternative work
arrangements and as flexible scheduling grows common, the Internet and advanced
communication products are enabling home-based workers to have the same access
to online resources as their colleagues and competitors who work in traditional
settings. 
<p>
Teleworking
allows employees to schedule home and work activities as necessary and gives
them the flexibility to manage their time. The increased emphasis on speed and
accountability in the new economy is quickly replacing the idea that "face
time" at the office is the most important thing. Instead of being
responsible for their time, teleworkers now are responsible for their work
product.
<p>
This blurring of work and home life is being enabled by digital technology that
allows an office to be located anywhere—the city, the suburbs or a mountain
top—using a range of workstyle products including pagers, wireless phones,
PDAs, laptops and of course, the desktop PC. Digital imaging, wireless devices,
Internet access devices, portable peripherals and handheld navigational
equipment are the epitome of "convergence" incorporating technology
from the telecom, PC and consumer electronics industries.

<font class="subhead">DVD-Audio</font><p>

DVD, the fastest selling product in the history of consumer
electronics, is driving the surround experience.Considering its many applications for audio, video and data, it
truly is a “digital versatile disc.”
<p>
DVD-ROM drives are fast becoming a standard feature, making
surround sound a reality on our PCs either through a four- or five-channel
speaker system, or through a two-speaker array creating a virtual experience.
Since the user is in a near-field listening environment, either approach is
effective.
<p>
In 2000, CEA numbers show factory sales of DVD-Video players
to be more than 6.6 million units. For 2001, sales are projected to exceed 9
million units, ringing up more than $2 billion in total factory sales. In
addition to playing movie soundtracks in Dolby Digital or DTS, DVD-Video
players can play the new 5.1 multichannel music discs, which appeared on the
market in anticipation of a DVD-Audio solution.The success of DVD in the marketplace should guarantee the
success of any new DVD-based mulitchannel audio format such as DVD-Audio and
Super Audio CD (SACD).
<p>
Surround music means that at home, you will be
able to hear music the same way the musicians and engineers do while playing or
mixing music. The sonic realism and depth of this new listening experience is
dramatically different from what we have come to expect.

<font class="subhead">PDAs and Handheld Computing</font>
<p>
These days, handhelds are not only commonplace for business travelers and
information professionals.They're being mainstreamed into both consumer and business-to-business applications. 
handhelds are changing the way we think of computers and revolutionizing the way we work and live.
<p>
A technology first popularized by companies such as Sharp Electronics Corp.,
Casio Inc. and Psion in the late 1980s, the personal digital assistant, or PDA,
was the genesis of the handheld computer of today. The PDA was envisioned as a
portable computing device that could deliver finite chunks of data, such as
schedules and address books, without the need for a separate PC system.
<p>
Almost a decade later, most of these proprietary systems have largely settled under
one of several technological umbrellas that offer consumers outstanding
capabilities and convenience. Today's handhelds offer such common PC functions
as word processing, spreadsheets, games, e-mail and Web surfing. They work
through a variety of input methods, such as keyboards, pen-type input and voice
recording, and typically are able to interface with personal computers for file
updates and synchronization.
