<span class="section_title">Hottest Technology Under the Sun Expected at the 2005 International CES </span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Online Registration for the 2005 International CES Is Now Open at www.CESweb.org</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;7/6/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
The hottest and newest technology from more than 2,400 global companies will debut at the 2005 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, January 6-9.  General attendee registration is now available at www.CESweb.org.  
<P>
As ranked by TradeshowWeek, the International CES is North America's largest annual tradeshow of any kind. Produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the International CES helps attendees gain an understanding of the vibrant consumer electronics industry.  From wireless, digital imaging, computing and networking technology to audio, video, electronic gaming and accessories for the home, office and road, consumer electronics keep people connected with family, friends and information 24 hours a day worldwide.
<P>
"The consumer electronics industry continues to grow each year, encompassing more and more product areas and economic sectors.  The International CES parallels the industry's growth, and you can expect an even more dynamic CES for 2005," exclaimed CEA Vice President of Events and Conferences Karen Chupka.  "Because the show provides the industry's best value, exhibitors and attendees can get much of their business for the year done in just four days, as well as interact with the 'who's who' of the global technology industry"  
<P>
The 2005 International CES covers more than 20 product areas spread throughout both the inside and outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Alexis Park.  Some of the exhibitors taking significant space at the 2005 show include: Alpine, Audiovox, Casio, Daewoo, Delphi, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Kenwood, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Panasonic, Pioneer, Rockford, Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Toshiba. 
<P>
In addition to CES exhibits and educational conference sessions, more than a dozen specialty TechZones will showcase some of the latest products driving the $101 billion consumer electronics industry, including broadband, ultra wideband technology, home networking, digital video recording, MP3, in-car digital systems, portable power, storage compression, electronics recycling and assistive devices.
<P>
"As the industry's main event, CES attracts more than 130,000 industry professionals from 110 countries - many from beyond the traditional scope of the CE industry such as content providers, broadcast professionals and public policy leaders," said Chupka.  "We remain committed to making sure every attendee and exhibitor has the best possible experience in order to grow their businesses throughout the year."
<P>
To help attendees catch all the hottest products during the show, the CES Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase honors and profiles the newest and best designed and engineered products.  Press and analysts have the chance to get an early look at the 2005 Innovations honorees and other top exhibitors during CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES, on Tuesday evening, January 4.  
<P>

Beyond registration, attendees can make their hotel and travel arrangements through www.CESweb.org.  International guests can obtain help in applying for travel visas via the website as well.
Note to Journalists:  	Detailed press conference information will be available later this year. Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 4, 2005 to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events.  CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES will run January 4 from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in the Las Vegas Convention Center, room S226, across the hallway from the CES Press Room.
