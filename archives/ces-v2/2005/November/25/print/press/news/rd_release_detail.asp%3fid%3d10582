<span class="section_title">Texas Instruments President And Ceo Rich Templeton To Keynote At The 2005 International CES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">TI's Templeton Joins Roster of Consumer Electronics Leaders Delivering Keynote Addresses</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>San Francisco, California&nbsp;-&nbsp;10/19/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2005 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) announced today that Rich Templeton, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Texas Instruments (TI), will present a keynote address on Friday, January 7, 2005 at 3:30 p.m. at the Las Vegas Hilton Theater.  The 2005 International CES, the world's largest annual technology showcase, will be held in Las Vegas, Nev. from January 6-9, 2005.  
<p>
"Known for his business savvy, Rich Templeton has executed visionary semiconductor strategies that continue to expand and enhance the consumer electronics industry and drive a wide variety of the hottest consumer electronics products in the marketplace," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of CES.  "His presence and participation at CES is a key component of the lineup of industry leaders we are honored to present during the world's largest technology tradeshow."
<p>
Credited with helping to define and carry out TI's strategy to focus on semiconductors for real-time signal processing, Templeton guided TI through the worst downturn in the semiconductor industry's history while maintaining the company's strategic investments in R&D and advanced manufacturing.  His leadership helped TI to emerge in stronger strategic, technological and product positions.
<p>
Templeton became president and chief executive officer of Texas Instruments in May 2004 and has served on the company's board of directors since July 2003.  He joined the company in 1980 after earning a bachelor's of science degree in electrical engineering from Union College in New York. He spent his career in the company's semiconductor business, beginning in sales and eventually becoming president of the division.
<p>
Templeton joins Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect of Microsoft Corp., Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel Corp., Ed Zander, chairman and CEO of Motorola Inc. and Carly Fiorna, chairman and CEO of HP as confirmed keynote speakers for the 2005 International CES.
<p>
The 2005 International CES focuses on more than 20 product areas from more than 2,400 exhibitors spread throughout both the inside and outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton, and the Alexis Park. For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.
<p>

Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 4, 2005 to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events.  CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES will run January 4 from 4-7-p.m. in the Las Vegas Convention Center, room S226, across the hall from the CES Press Room.
