<span class="section_title">INDEPENDENT AUDIT REVEALS BREADTH, DEPTH AND GLOBAL IMPACT OF THE 2005 INTERNATIONAL CES </span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">145,868 Industry Professionals Attend 2005 CES, Setting New Show Record </span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;6/6/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
With more than 22,000 international attendees and 40,000 senior level executives from 110 countries, the 2005 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) drew a record 145,868 industry professionals, January 6-9, 2005, in Las Vegas, Nevada, as reported by VERIS Consulting's independent audit released this week.
<p>
	"The International CES continues to excel at delivering the 'who's who' of the industry at this must-attend event for networking, new product launches and deal-making," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of the International CES.  "These audit numbers confirm the success and international reach of the event and demonstrate to exhibitors the return on investment they receive from participating in CES."
<p>
	The 2005 International CES was the largest in the show's 39-year history in terms of overall attendance, international attendance and exhibitor square footage.  The record-breaking attendance for 2005 showed a nine percent increase from 2004, while attracting 51 percent of Fortune 500 companies.   This year, 2,500 exhibitors participated utilizing 1.5 million square feet of exhibit space.
<p>
	Leading global companies in the audio, accessories, broadcasting, cable, digital imaging, electronic gaming, emerging technology, home networking, home theater, mobile electronics, video and wireless industries attend the International CES.
<p>
      The audit revealed that CES continues to attract top business leaders from all product and market segments.  Seventeen percent of the 2005 International CES attendees were presidents, CEOs and business owners.  According to the VERIS report, one of three CES attendees is a senior-level executive (president, CEO, owner, vice president, director or general manager), and one of three attendees make final decisions about new product purchasing.
<p>
	The International CES draws more government officials than any other non-government tradeshow in the United States, with 130 leaders from the federal and foreign governments attending in 2005. In addition, representatives from 250 universities attended the 2005 International CES as institutional buyers, market analysts and engineers.
 <p>     
      With a rise in overall attendance at the 2005 International CES, several specific categories saw a significant increase.  Represented this year were 110 countries, with the international attendance increasing more than 20 percent from 2004. Additionally, while numerous industry leaders attend CES annually, more than 40 percent of the 2005 attendees were newcomers to the show.
<p>      
      Influential analysts and media attend the show each year to see the latest and greatest trends. More than 2,200 analysts attended in 2005, an 18 percent increase from 2004, and total media attendance was 4,500.
<p>      
      VERIS Consulting audited CEA's tradeshow attendance records, verifying the 2005 International CES registration procedures and record keeping systems. A VERIS Consulting tradeshow audit provides verification of exhibition records, including direct on-site observation, examination of registration systems and testing of attendee records. Total attendance counts are verified, as well as records and record-keeping systems. Post-show analysis includes direct confirmation sampling, reconciliation of attendance lists, elimination of duplicate names and verification of demographic data with source of documentation.
<p>      
      Leading the tradeshow industry, CEA began independent audits for the International CES in 1997. Often, final audit numbers can differ from estimates given on-site due to additional badge pick-ups and badge reader reports.  This audit complies with the industry standards for audits adopted by the International Association of Exhibition Management in August 2004.  In addition, CEA is a member of the newly formed Exhibition and Events Industry Audit Council, which is responsible for determining standard guidelines for conducting trade show audits.
<p>      
      With more than 1.4 million square feet of exhibit space already sold, the 2006 International CES will be held Thursday, January 5 through Sunday, January 8, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The International CES is the largest annual tradeshow in North America, per Tradeshow Week.

Detailed press conference information will be available later this year. Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 3, 2006, to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events, including CES Unveiled on January 3.
