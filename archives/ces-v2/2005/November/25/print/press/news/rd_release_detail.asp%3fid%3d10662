<span class="section_title">CEA Joins the Wireless Foundation in Call to Protect® Wireless Recycling Campaign</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">CEA Extends Reach of CALL TO PROTECT to include its Wireless Dealer Members </span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/7/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) today announced an agreement to join The Wireless Foundation in its CALL TO PROTECT® wireless recycling initiative.  Through this agreement, CEA's wireless dealer membership base will have direct access to the information and materials necessary to collect wireless phones for the CALL TO PROTECT campaign in their retail locations.
<p>
The CALL TO PROTECT campaign collects wireless phones to benefit victims of domestic violence. Proceeds from the sale of phones help fund agencies leading the campaign to end domestic violence, while other phones are refurbished and become lifelines for domestic violence victims when faced with an emergency situation.
<p>
"CEA is proud to join The Wireless Foundation in the CALL TO PROTECT wireless recycling campaign," said Gary Shapiro, CEA president and CEO.  "This program is a testament to the power of technology and the ability of an industry to offer a truly beneficial service to those who need it most.  We believe that CEA's wireless retailer members will help expand the success of this program."
<p>
"We are pleased to welcome CEA into our CALL TO PROTECT campaign," said the Wireless Foundation President Steve Largent.  "CEA's decision to join the CALL TO PROTECT campaign will certainly broaden and extend the program's valuable work on behalf of domestic violence victims.  As an industry that aggressively promotes and encourages the recycling of its products in a manner that benefits both local charity and the environment, we are proud to gain the support of CEA in this worthy endeavor," continued Largent.
<p> 
Since this program began in 1996, nearly two million used wireless phones have been collected to benefit CALL TO PROTECT, enabling the donation of more than 36,000 wireless phones with airtime and more than $3 million in grants to organizations leading the campaign to end domestic violence.  In addition, because all equipment collected by CALL TO PROTECT is either reused or responsibly recycled, more than 200 tons of retired electronics have been kept out of landfills.
