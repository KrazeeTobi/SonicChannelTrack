<LI>Fire extinguishers, fire hose cabinets, fire alarm pull stations, and exit signage must not be blocked and must remain visible. </LI>
<LI>Exhibitors may not use or have access to any existing storage closets and utility rooms within the meeting room. </LI>
<LI>All persons who are in the process of designing exhibits or displays for these meeting rooms are encouraged to contact the Clark County Fire Marshal’s Office at (702) 455-7023 for clarification of all rules and regulations.&nbsp; All plans must be submitted to the Fire Marshal for final approval. </LI>
<LI>Electrical service is limited in the meeting rooms.&nbsp; Exhibitors must contact SES in advance to arrange for their electrical requirements.&nbsp; SES can be reached at (702) 733-5070. </LI>
<LI>Exterior room signage may not extend more than two (2) feet into the corridor, must be adjacent to the room’s permanent outside wall, and must have prior written approval from CES Operations.&nbsp; This design must also be included in your submitted layout to Rachel Bender and Gaiya Sims, as listed above.&nbsp; Displays of any kind may not be set up in corridors outside meeting rooms. </LI>
<LI>Any damages are the sole responsibility of the exhibiting company. </LI>
<LI>Keys to each Venetian Hotel meeting room will be held in the CES security office (room 101, lower level of the Sands).&nbsp; There is a $100 deposit per key.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deposit will be refunded at the end of the show when the keys are returned.&nbsp; All keys must be signed in and out through the security office. The keys are the sole responsibility of the exhibiting company. Although exhibitors maintain responsibility of the keys, exhibitors should still plan to secure valuables as the majority of meeting rooms are joined by airwall doors that cannot be locked and Venetian in-house services may also have access to these rooms. </LI>
<LI>Meeting room floor plans are available upon request.&nbsp; Contact CES Operations at (703) 907-7685 or <A href="mailto:gsims@CE.org">gsims@CE.org</A>. </LI>
<LI>Measurements may not be exact.&nbsp; If you are planning a display with specific size requirements, we strongly recommend you or your EAC measure the room(s) in person.</LI></OL>

<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Exhibitors may not make any modifications to the structure of the 3.5m x 5m D-Rooms. </LI>
<LI>Any D-Rooms larger than 1000 square feet must have a fire sprinkler system and a 10' aisle drawn into the D-Room design. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Using plexiglass alters the sound absorbing qualities of the demonstration rooms. D-Rooms using plexiglass must adhere to the 85 dB sound rules. <B>NOTE:</B> When demonstrating audio equipment within an enclosed demonstration room, position subwoofers away from walls that abut neighboring exhibitors. Sonic vibration nuisance complaints will be acted upon by Show Management; if situations are not rectified by the offending party, Show Management reserves the right to shut down exhibits. </LI>
<LI>Signage may be placed on the exterior walls of the D-Rooms to a maximum height of 8 feet. Signage is not permitted on top of any D-Rooms smaller than 7m x 10m. Any requests for hanging signs over D-Rooms must adhere to hanging sign regulations in the International CES Exhibitor manual, and must be coordinated through GES for LVCC exhibitors SES for Sands&nbsp;exhibitors.</LI></UL>
