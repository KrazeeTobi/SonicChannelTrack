<span class="subhead">General Information</span>
<br><br>
An Exhibitor Appointed Contractor (EAC) is any company other than the designated "official" contractors listed in this service manual, which provides a service (booth installation/dismantling, security personnel, florists, photographers, audio/visual, etc.) and needs access to your exhibit anytime during the installation, show dates and dismantling.<BR><BR>CES will consider exceptions to the use of official contractors only in the following cases:
<UL>
<LI>Permission has been requested by the exhibitor in writing on the exhibitor's company letterhead, or using the Notice of Intent Form.&nbsp;Authorization requests must come from the exhibiting company. </LI>
<LI>In addition, EACs must submit an EAC Agreement and Certificate(s) of Insurance. </LI>
<LI>EAC insurance must maintain policies covering worker's compensation, property damage and personal injury in the amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) each.&nbsp;The EAC must name the following as additional insureds, regardless of which show location the exhibit is being displayed: 
<UL>
<LI>Consumer Electronics Association </LI>
<LI>Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority </LI>
<LI>The Interface Group-Nevada Inc., Interface Group-Massachusetts Inc., and The Las Vegas Sands Inc. and their respective subsidiaries and Principal(s), Directors, Officers, and Employees thereof; and Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and its Successors and Assigns </LI>
<LI>Las Vegas Hilton </LI>
<LI>Alexis Park </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>Copies of Certificates of Insurance should be sent to CEA, GES, as well as the specific show location, before commencing work on property (refer to Section 1, General Information for mailing addresses).<BR><BR>Each of the show locations retains a current list of approved EACs on hand at all times, should the venue be notified that work is being performed by an EAC not on the approved list, an authorized individual representing the venue will investigate and take the necessary actions through CES Operations to insure compliance with the EAC rules.&nbsp;Additionally, EACs intending to work in the LVCC or Sands must have approval from the venue.&nbsp;For more information, call the LVCC at (702) 892-2940 or the Sands at (702) 733-5070.<BR><BR>Exceptions to the use of CES official contractors will be granted only if the EAC does not interfere with or prejudice the orderly set-up, interim services or dismantling of the exhibit.&nbsp; An exception will not be granted if it is inconsistent with the commitments made and obligations assumed by CEA or in its lease with the LVCC, the Sands, Las Vegas Hilton or Alexis Park.<BR><BR>Requests, addendum or substitutions to an EAC selection after the deadline of <STRONG>DECEMBER 9, 2005 </STRONG>will not be considered.<BR><BR>Failure to meet any of the above requirements will prohibit the EAC from accessing the show floor and/or servicing EAC’s client.<BR><BR>Use of EACs is subject to CEA's contractual obligations, security and safety requirements.&nbsp;If any exhibitor brings an EAC onto the exhibit floor, that exhibitor is responsible for that contractor's worker's compensation and liability insurance certificates, and must send them to CES, GES and the appropriate show location. Under no circumstances shall these procedures be circumvented.&nbsp;<BR><BR>In addition, the following requirements must be satisfied by any EAC, display house or other company providing a service at CES:<BR><BR><STRONG>EACs must agree to the following:</STRONG></P>
<OL type=1>
<LI>To remove all gang boxes, ladders, or other equipment from the aisle or other common areas by the close of work orders as specified in section 11, Installation and Dismantling.&nbsp;The EAC is permitted to store equipment in the exhibitor's booth only. </LI>
<LI>Not to operate a service desk of any type within the exhibit hall, unless specifically approved by CES.&nbsp; If approved, the service desk is to be set up at the EAC's expense. </LI>
<LI>That any property of the EAC not removed at the close of working hours is left at their own risk.&nbsp;Further, any such property may be moved, removed or stored at the EAC's expense if it is considered for any reason by CES to interfere with any aspect of the move-in or move-out.&nbsp; CES reserves the right to require pre-payment as a condition of returning said property. </LI>
<LI>To abide by the fire and safety regulations, all other prevailing regulations of governmental agencies and the exhibit hall. </LI>
<LI>To abide by the rules and regulations of the event as set forth or amended by CES.</LI></OL><BR>The EAC must confine its operations to the exhibit area of its clients. No service desk, storage areas or other work facilities shall be located within the exhibit facilities contracted by CES.&nbsp; Show aisles and public space are not considered part of the booth area.&nbsp;The EAC may not, under any circumstances, solicit business on the show floor.<BR><BR>The EAC further agrees that CES may expel them from the premises at any time should they be found to be working in any exhibitor's booth not listed on the EAC Agreement, unless authorized in advance by CES.<BR><BR>In addition to any other remedies available by law, CES reserves the right, upon notice to the EAC, to revoke the approval of the EAC with respect to any or all exhibitors, and/or remove the EAC if: 
<UL>
<LI>A&nbsp;breach by the EAC of any of the provisions of the EAC Agreement or a breach by the EAC of any of the rules/regulations of CES </LI>
<LI>The EAC’s participation at the show may lead to strikes, picketing, or other labor action directed at the show </LI>
<LI>Other disruption of the show or unreasonable interference with or inconvenience to the show or any of the exhibitors</LI></UL>

<span class="subhead">LVCC EAC Requirements</span>
<br><br>
<STRONG>LVCC Exhibitors only</STRONG>:&nbsp; In addition to CES’ EAC paperwork, the LVCC Contractor and Vendor Requirements and Supervisory Personnel Requirements forms and documentation found in this section are required.<BR><STRONG><BR>Workers’ Compensation in the State of Nevada<BR></STRONG>If the home state of the contractor does not have a reciprocal agreement with the State of Nevada, contact Employers Insurance Company of Nevada (EICN) to obtain proper coverage:&nbsp; phone (702) 837-3000 or <A href="http://www.eicn.com/" target=_blank>http://www.eicn.com/</A>.<BR><STRONG><BR>Badges/Contractor Photo Identification <BR></STRONG>As a result of September 11, 2001, the demand for a high level of security nationwide has increased. The LVCC and the Sands has taken action to create that level of assurance and comfort to the customers of the industry, including attendees and exhibitors.&nbsp;Although it is not expected these measures will guarantee all security systems are 100 percent effective, they have been established to heighten security.<BR><BR>Effective May 15, 2002, all official trade associates and/or member affiliates, including, but not limited to, building employees, union workers, or contractors needing access to exhibit halls, will be required at all times to display photo identification meeting the following criteria recommended by members of the industry badging committee and approved by the Las Vegas Convention and Vistor’s Authority (LVCVA).&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; This is a destination badge, and is not considered a national badge).<BR><BR>This badging/photo identification requirement does not apply to show staff, attendees or exhibitors who will continue to receive badges directly from the show/lessee.&nbsp;This policy applies to all vendors, contractors, staff, etc. who need access to the CES show floor. <BR><BR>The badge shall be displayed on outer garment for easy visibility, upper left side of chest.&nbsp;Due to regard for safety, consideration will be given when meeting this standard (e.g. fall arrest harness, etc.)<BR>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>VERY IMPORTANT!</STRONG>&nbsp; Order services required from GES Exposition Services and SES (Sands only) in advance. Ordering labor or services on-site which GES or SES may not be prepared to provide immediately, is expensive and will significantly delay the set-up of your booth or force your set-up into overtime. </LI>
<LI>Take steps to protect your client’s product in the booth by arranging for booth security and/or cages. </LI>
<LI>Stay out of adjacent booths during set-up. </LI>
<LI>Label empty cartons and crates for storage as soon as they are ready.&nbsp;Holding back until the last minute only adds congestion to the aisles. </LI>
<LI>&nbsp;Do not store empty cartons inside of empty crates.&nbsp;Cartons are returned from storage first, so exhibitors may begin packing their product. </LI>
<LI>Keep “No Freight Aisles” clear at all times! </LI>
<LI>Submit outbound freight bills to the service desk in a timely manner. Holding freight bills until late in the day, or turning in large amounts of freight bills to the service desk at one time, may delay outbound truck scheduling and force your loading-out into overtime.</LI></UL>
