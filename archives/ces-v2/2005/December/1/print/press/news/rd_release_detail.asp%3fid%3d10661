<span class="section_title">CEA PARA Division Raising Awareness of Specialty Audio-Video Through Industry Education And Communication</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">2005 PARA Management Conference A </span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/6/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
The merger of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and the Professional Audio-Video Retailers Association (PARA) is going "very well" and is bearing fruit, according to CEA PARA Division Chairman and Flanner's Audio-Video President John Flanner.  Flanner made his comments to PARA Division dealers this morning at a breakfast meeting held during the International CES, the world's largest annual technology tradeshow, being held January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Flanner presented an update to Division dealers on progress achieved since the official merger on June 1, 2004. 
<p>      
"CEA's PARA Division is committed to raising the awareness and professionalism of the specialty audio-video industry," Flanner said.  "Six months into this merger, we're putting the pieces into place and are taking full advantage of the benefits offered by CEA membership to help us achieve our goals." 
<p>      
Flanner explained that the division now is organized into four committees with oversight by the PARA Division Board: Membership & Benefits, Conferences, Education and Promotions.  Membership & Benefits is co-chaired by a dealer member, Gary Lawson, buyer, Century Stereo and manufacturer member Steve Caldero, vice president of sales, Yamaha Electronics Corp.  The Conference Committee, which focuses on the annual PARA Management Conference is chaired by Gary Yacoubian, president of Myer Emco.  Three co-chairs - Gary Warzin, president of Audiophile Systems, George Liu, president, Audio Visions South and Craig Abplanalp of Definitive Audio, steer the Education Committee, which Flanner described as the "work horse for PARA," since it focuses on education for CEOs and store owners, education for management and education for sales teams.  Finally, the Promotions Committee is chaired by Charlie Bock, president of Stereo Barn, and is committed to raising the awareness of the PARA Division within the industry and to increasing communication within the division itself.  
<p>      
Conference Committee Chairman Gary Yacoubian provided breakfast attendees with an update on the upcoming PARA Management Conference, which will be held May 11-15 at the Hotel Del Coronado in Coronado, California.  Characterizing the annual event as a "key member benefit," Yacoubian said the purpose of the conference is to provide attendees with a better understanding of the industry and a better understanding of their business.
<p>      
"Our goal is to have 2005 PARA Management Conference attendees walk away with ideas to raise profitability and professionalism," he said.  "This must-attend event is designed to give you the nuts and bolts ideas to then take back home and profit from them."  
<p>      
Registration for the 2005 PARA Management Conference opened at the International CES and also is available online at www.CE.org/events.   
<p>      
Flanner concluded his remarks by encouraging active PARA Division members to become ambassadors within the industry and to encourage greater involvement by other members in current and future Division activities.  "We want to include non-Board members in our committee activities and have broad representation in what we're striving to accomplish."
