<div class="section_title">2005 International CES Attracts Most Influential Array of Media in Show History </div>
<span class="text">
The 2005 International CES set media coverage and international media attendance records again. Through a year-round media outreach campaign, the 2005 International CES attracted more than 4,500 media outlets&nbsp;from 48 countries. These results stand on par with the 2004 show even as CES instituted more stringent media registration criteria to focus on media quality over quantity. 
<P>The show set a few new media records for media attendance and coverage, including: </P>
<UL>
<LI>the number of international media (up nine percent, with 890 media). </LI>
<LI>the number of analysts (up 20 percent, to more than 2,200 financial and industry analysts). </LI>
<LI>Overall show coverage (up about five percent, to more than 3,000 articles and stories). </LI>
<LI>Japanese coverage increased more than 20 percent, as we generated 790 articles and stories in Japanese media, ranking the country first in coverage outside the U.S. </LI></UL>
<P>In addition, the 2005 International CES was covered by national outlets such as AP, Reuters, <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM>, <EM>Investor’s Business Daily</EM>, <EM>USA Today</EM>, <EM>Financial Times</EM>, and <EM>Forbes</EM> and the national editions for the <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM>, <EM>New York Times</EM> and <EM>Washington Post</EM>. Top national broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, NBC and NPR also covered the 2005 International CES. </P>
<P>Cable and broadcast television carried extensive live and taped coverage of the show nationwide, including programs such as <EM>CBS Sunday Morning News</EM>, <EM>ESPN’s Cold Pizza</EM> and <EM>CNN Headline News</EM>. In addition to the cable and broadcast coverage, the 2005 International CES b-roll was used by 334 local TV stations across the country reaching an estimated audience of 10,661,895 via 489 telecasts. More than 200 leading magazines, business, consumer and trade publications were on-site covering the events that transpired, reaching more than 150 million readers. </P>
<P>And the show’s international coverage continues to grow. In addition to the great coverage in Japan, we saw increased coverage in China, Korea, Europe and Mexico.</P>

    <p><strong>Bring Your Dreams to Life with Our Vision</strong><br> by Dan Cole</p>
    Like the legendary aspirations of Martin Luther King, Jr., I have a dream. It hinges around the success of each CES exhibitor above and beyond the actual trade show each January.
<P>If my dream came to life, you and each of our 2,500+ exhibitors would report year-over-year growth and endless opportunities to put your story into the hands of the industry movers and shakers.</P>
<P>So I’m constantly thinking of ways to make that dream a reality for us all. In my sleep, in my car, at my desk; it’s always there. And it occurred to me that a solid vision could, in fact, spur this dream along. <EM>Consumer Electronics Vision</EM>, that is.</P>
<P>The official publication of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), <EM>CE Vision </EM>is the only publication to circulate deep within the consumer electronics industry, from manufacturing to retail. <EM>CE Vision</EM> drills down to precisely what top management needs to know to make sound business decisions.</P>
<P>For advertisers, <EM>CE Vision </EM>is a&nbsp; straight path to the people within the industry that design, develop, manufacture, buy and distribute audio, video, mobile electronics, wireless and landline communications, IT, home networking, multimedia, accessory products and related services sold through consumer channels.</P>
<P>In addition to the great advertising opportunities, there’s also still time to keep pitching your post-CES stories.</P>
<P>While the news dailies and broadcast news have banked most of their CES stories by now, the trade and consumer monthlies are still going strong.&nbsp; For example, CEA’s <EM>CE Vision</EM> magazine is featuring three top stories in its <A href="http://www.ce.org/publications/vision/" target=_blank>March-April issue</A>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Point Counterpoint: Blue Ray Vs. HD-DVD </LI>
<LI>Networking Home Entertainment&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Post-CES Show Coverage</LI></UL>
<P><EM>CE Vision </EM>reaches 23,000 industry manufacturers, retailers and business developers – basically taking the core CES attendee audience and delivering t-industry news six times a year right to their offices. This award-winning magazine circulates to the most established and successful businesses in the CE market. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>In May/June, look for <EM>CE Vision </EM>stories on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>USB Flash Drives and Storage Drive Devices&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Changing Distribution Channels </LI>
<LI>What’s Next for Digital Imaging?</LI></UL>
<P>In July/August, <EM>CE Vision </EM>profiles:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Hybrid Car&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>HDTV Advances&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Digital Audio </LI></UL>
<P>For editorial pitches, contact Publisher/Editor-in-Chief Cindy Stevens at (703) 907-7609, <A href="mailto:cstevens@CE.org">cstevens@CE.org</A>.&nbsp; For <EM>CE Vision </EM>advertising, check out the issue online&nbsp;or contact NAPCO Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing Rick Albuck at (215) 238-5215, <A href="mailto:rickalbuck@napco.com">rickalbuck@napco.com</A>.</P>
<P>Use our <EM>Vision</EM> to make your dreams—and mine—come true.</P>
