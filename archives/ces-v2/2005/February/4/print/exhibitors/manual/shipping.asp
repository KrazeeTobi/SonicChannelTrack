<span class="subhead">Target Freight Move-In</span>
<br><br>
The first thing you want to do is consult your color-coded Target Freight Floorplan to determine your designated day for arrival of your freight. Strict adherence to this schedule will expedite the installation of your exhibit. It is your responsibility to notify both your display house and carrier of your target date. <BR><BR>If you ship your freight in advance to the GES warehouse (see Advance Shipments), your freight will be in your booth at 8:00 a.m. on your target date. This is one of the benefits of shipping in advance. You’ll pay a slightly higher rate, but you know your freight will be there when you arrive and you can schedule labor to work the full day. <BR><BR>If you ship your freight direct to show site (see Direct Shipments), your freight will be delivered to your booth on your target day. Your carrier may check-in starting at 6:00 a.m. at the designated marshalling yard (see Marshalling Yard). Please keep in mind that freight receiving is an all-day process and it may take several hours for your truck to move through the marshalling line, and then for your freight to be unloaded and delivered to your booth. We strongly encourage you to schedule labor for 8:00 a.m. on the morning <STRONG>following</STRONG> your target date. <BR><BR><STRONG>Off-Target Freight:</STRONG> If you do not meet your specified target date, an additional charge of $10.30 per hundred-weight (cwt) will be applied. This policy will be strictly enforced if your direct shipment arrives on a day before or after your specified target date. Off-target charges will also apply if your truck checks in at the freight receiving area after 2:00 p.m. on your target date. Off-target charges only apply to display freight. This does not include product shipments, which should not be delivered until Monday, January&nbsp;3, 2005&nbsp;or after.

<span class="subhead">Product Target Dates</span>
<br><br>
Target dates are for <STRONG>display freight only</STRONG>, not for product. Product shipments will be accepted starting Monday, <STRONG>January 3, 2005</STRONG>. Bills of lading from your carrier must clearly state the shipment is, whether display or product, to avoid off-target charges on product. Any product shipment that is not clearly marked as such will be charged the off-target charge of $10.30 per hundred-weight (cwt). <BR><BR>To avoid the risk of theft:<BR>
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Refrain for delivering your valuable product until Monday, January 3, 2005. </LI>
<LI>Consider having it delivered to a secured storage area until Monday, January 3, 2005. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Order booth guards to protect your protect. </LI>
<LI>Ship your products in discreet packaging (plain, unmarked cases, cartons, etc.) and/or in locked security cages. </LI></UL>

<span class="subhead">Held Freight / Non-Payment</span>
<br><br>
Exhibitors are not permitted to begin set up on the show floor unless their exhibit space is paid in full. CES show management will direct GES and other show contractors not to deliver show freight to your booth or provide other show services if you exhibit space is not paid in full. <BR>

<span class="subhead">Material Handling Charges</span>
<br><br>
Material handling is charged in 100 lb. increments, referred to as hundred-weight or cwt. Weight is rounded up to the next 100 lbs. For example, if you have 4,235 lbs. of freight, round that up to 4,300, divide by 100, and you will be charged for 43 hundred-weight or cwt. <BR><BR><STRONG>Material handling charges include:</STRONG> 
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Receiving and unloading your freight at the docks, </LI>
<LI>Delivery to your booth, </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Storage and return of empties at the close of the show, </LI>
<LI>Removal of your freight from your booth, and </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Reloading onto your outbound carrier. </LI></UL><BR>Advance freight will be charged at the rate of $46.65 per hundred-weight (cwt). Direct crated freight will be charged at $33.05 per hundred-weight (cwt). Rates are round-trip based on inbound weight (300 lb. minimum). <BR><BR>Uncrated Materials may only be sent direct to show site and will be charged $41.40 per hundred-weight (cwt). They include the following: 
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Loose, uncrated or pad-wrapped freight. </LI>
<LI>Loads of 30% or more by volume (uncrated), which have been mixed throughout the truck with crated material. If shipping arrangements require your load to be mixed (crated material and special handling items on one truck), please keep special handling items separate, preferably at the tail of the truck. You will only be charged the special handling rate for those items. A separate weight ticket is required for that portion of the shipment. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Unique unloading or loading requirements regardless of the kind of carrier or vehicle used. </LI></UL><BR><STRONG>Mobile Rate:</STRONG> A $156.00 round-trip per vehicle spotting charge will apply for all self-propelled or pushed vehicles. Any additional requirements, such as towing, will be charged on a time and materials basis.&nbsp; If you have additional questions regarding display vehicles please contact&nbsp;the GES Freight Operations Center at&nbsp;<A href="mailto:cesfreightoperations@gesexpo.com">cesfreightoperations@GESexpo.com</A>&nbsp;or (702) 515-5655.

<br><br>
GES Exposition Services will receive crated shipments in advance at their warehouse starting&nbsp;November&nbsp;29 through December 17, 2004. The GES warehouse will be closed Saturday, December 25 and Sunday, December 26, 2004, in observance of Christmas and Saturday, January 1, 2005, in observance of New Year’s Day. Shipments arriving at the GES warehouse after December 17, 2004, will incur an additional late to warehouse charge of $14.05 per hundred-weight (cwt). <BR><BR>Freight sent in advance to the GES warehouse must be crated and may not include any product. Uncrated and product shipments must be sent direct to show site. <BR><BR>Advance freight will be charged $46.65 per hundred-weight (cwt). While slightly higher than shipping directly to show site, there are several benefits to shipping in advance to the warehouse: 
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Your carrier has a much wider delivery window vs. having one specific target date to deliver direct to show site. </LI>
<LI>Because of the wider delivery window, there will also be much less waiting time in line for your carrier. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>You can contact GES to confirm that your shipment has arrived. </LI>
<LI>Your shipment will be delivered to your booth by 8:00 a.m. on your target date. </LI></UL><BR><STRONG>Address for ADVANCE shipments:</STRONG><BR>

<br><br>
If you have a small amount of materials that you need assistance with, you are eligible to take advantage of the new Cart-Load Service offered by GES. By "small amount," we mean typically the amount of materials that would fit into the trunk of a standard passenger car. Exhibitors can bypass marshalling and go to one of three designated areas for assistance. These areas are 1) outside of Freight Door 1 for exhibitors in the North and Central 1-2 Halls, 2) outside Freight Door 9 for exhibitors in Central 3-5, and 3) the east end of the South Hall for exhibitors in the South Halls. <BR><BR>See the Cart-Load Service information located in the GES Services section for a map of these areas. Costs are $41.60 per cart-load, and this service is available during move-in beginning on Monday, January&nbsp;3 through Wednesday, January&nbsp;5 from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. each day, and during move-out on Sunday, January&nbsp;9 from 6:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m.

Arrangements for outbound freight must be made at the GES service desk by 2:00 p.m. on January 9, 2005. Service representatives will assist in scheduling, filling out Outbound Material Handling Order Forms and general coordination of all outbound freight activities.&nbsp; Please note that GES cannot guarantee your outbound carrier to be loaded at the LVCC or LV Hilton on the same day of chek-in at the marshalling yard.&nbsp; Every effort will be made to do so; however, it is recommended that you check with your carrier in advance of move-out to discuss any surcharges that my be incurred for wait time.

<span class="subhead">Forced and/or Re-Consigned Freight</span>
<br><br>
"Forced Freight" refers to an exhibitor’s shipment that does not have an exhibitor-designated carrier. This is happens when an exhibitor chooses not to designate a carrier on the Outbound Material Handling Order Form (OMHOF) or an exhibitor fails to turn in an OMHOF to the GES Service Desk. GES will consign these shipments to the appropriate show carrier, based upon the shipment requirements - van line, LTL or airfreight. Shipments without outbound shipping labels and all international shipments will be returned to the GES warehouse. GES will notify the exhibitor and request exhibitor direction for the disposition of the freight. <BR><BR>"Re-Consigned Freight" refers to the re-routing (changing carriers) of an exhibitor’s shipment in the event the exhibitor’s chosen and specified carrier fails to get the shipment. This happens when the exhibitor-specified carrier fails to show up, may elect not to wait for the shipment, may refuse the shipment, etc. With the exception of international shipments, GES will re-consign (change carrier) these shipments. GES will choose the official show carrier that can handle the shipment in a manner consistent with the exhibitor’s requirements. International shipments will be returned to the GES warehouse, and GES will notify the exhibitor and hold for the exhibitor-designated carrier. <BR><BR>Shipments that are returned to the GES warehouse will be charged $15.75 per 100 lbs. (1000 lbs. min) for transportation and will begin to incur monthly storage charges of $5.25 per 100 lbs. (1000 lbs. min) two weeks after notification.

<br><br>
Materials (spare parts, printed materials, promotional items, etc.) that you will/might need during the show but do not have the room at your booth to store may be placed into access storage. <BR><BR>If you have a need for access storage you must go to the GES Service Desk to make the arrangements. GES will give you access storage labels which must be used to place upon your materials, pick up the materials and store them in an accessible manner. You can either pre-arrange deliveries during the show or can leave your access storage on a "will call" basis to be delivered when/if needed. <BR><BR>There is a one-time charge of $41.50 per pallet for access storage and a you are charged for the labor (1/2 hour min) every time you access your storage, including the initial delivery and the return at the close of the show.

<span class="subhead">International Shipping Guidelines</span>
<br><br>
International CES exhibitors cannot clear import goods through US Customs without using a Licensed Customs Broker if their import shipment is valued over US $2,000.00. Shipments with lower values may also require formal import entry by a Licensed Customs Broker if their goods are subject to either USDA, FDA or FCC US government agency release. <BR><BR>The Official International Freight Forwarder and Licensed Customs Broker for the 2005 International CES is GeoLogistics Expo Services, LLC. GeoLogistics Expo will be on-site during the move-in and move-out, as well as during the exhibition, to assist exhibitors with their import and export needs. <BR><BR>Using the services of non-official freight forwarders or customs brokers is permitted. However, if there is a problem or delay, then it is very difficult to obtain information after hours or on weekends from non-official forwarders. Non-official forwarders may also have to pay duties and taxes for temporary imports. Duties and taxes are not usually required for imports filed under the trade fair bond, which is held only by the Official International 2004 CES Forwarder and Licensed Customs Broker - GeoLogistics Expo. There are special service advantages and total cost savings by using GeoLogistics Expo Services. <BR><BR>Since January 2003, new security regulations have been introduced that effect imports by sea freight into the USA. All shipments destined to the USA must be approved by US Customs before they can be loaded onto a vessel overseas. This presents many challenges for exhibition shipments with no official US importing party. If the documents are filed incorrectly overseas, then the chances of intensive examination by US Customs are much more likely. Goods that are selected by intensive examination by US Customs suffer import release delays and increased costs. <BR><BR>It is imperative that the Customs documents are filed correctly before shipping from overseas. Otherwise, enormous problems and delays will occur when the shipment reaches the USA. Checking all documents and details before shipping with an official GeoLogistics Expo overseas agent can reduce the chances of extreme US Customs clearance delays once the freight reaches the American port of arrival, as well as help to avoid additional handling charges. <BR><BR>It is also important to send shipments as early as possible. All shipments must arrive by the deadlines published in the GeoLogistics Expo International Shipping information section of the exhibitor manual. The published dates are final deadlines, not target arrival dates. Shipments can arrive up to 1 month before the published deadlines, so plan to ship early. <BR><BR><STRONG>GeoLogistics Expo is the trade show import and export specialist.</STRONG> For specific questions regarding international shipping to the 2005 International CES, contact GeoLogistics Expo today. <BR><BR><B>Questions about International Shipping? </B><BR>Contact Margaret Churchill in the GeoLogistics Expo USA office for the most accurate detailed information:<BR><BR>
