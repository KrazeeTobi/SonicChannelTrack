		Gregg Davis has focused on reinventing the experience through design.  He looks at design as an opportunity to define the role that the end product plays by breaking down traditional constraints.  With a focus on brand positioning, line positioning and strategic planning, Gregg has taken product/brand development strategies to the core of design, enabling products to fill market voids and succeed in the marketplace in new and distinct roles.  In addition, Gregg aims to understand the dynamics of how the interaction between humans and technology affects the use of a product and its systems.

Following his graduation in Industrial Design from Pratt Institute, Gregg worked with Henry Dreyfuss Associates in New York City.  He co-founded Design Central in 1985.  Gregg has also been published in design periodicals and worked on the development of the Industrial Design Department at the University of Guadalajara, Mexico.  He has lectured in Taiwan and Korea on the design and innovation of products for export, has served as a juror for several national design competitions and lectured at the 2002 National Housewares show in Chicago, Illinois.

		Benjamín Pérez
Born in México D.F on December 1st, 1955

Since I was born, I have felt music inside of me.  At the age of 8, I built my first guitar amplifier, helped by an audio engineer; my first satisfaction was that it worked.  Since that time my life has been surrounded by audio and video technology.  I grew up playing my guitar in different kind of music groups and eventually became dedicated to the professional audio field.  During that time, I’d been working in the audio business, first in home systems, then in car audio and security systems.  I was the first to bring car audio technology to Mexico; it was a great success for me and for all the people that came after me.  My work at that time was focused on car audio because of the market’s demand, but lately the development of new products and technologies has guided me to open my field to other applications like Home Theater and Mobile Video.  At the same time, there existed no publications about audio, video, or high-end technologies for the Mexican consumer.  With a very good friend, Juan Marquez, I decided to start STEREOMANIA Magazine, a publication dedicated to promoting new technologies and innovations between consumers in Mexico.  More than thirty years of experience have kept me up to date with this field.  Attending twenty-five CES shows has been my strongest tool to stay ahead.
