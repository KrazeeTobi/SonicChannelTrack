        <div class="sub-content-header">Grassroots Campaign Calls for Americans to Sign and Show Support for Innovation</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jun 23, 2011 01:03:55</span>
        
        Today Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the <A href="http://www.CE.org" target=_blank>Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, </A>announced the launch of the <A href="http://www.DeclareInnovation.com " target=_blank>Declaration of Innovation</A>, an online pledge for Americans to sign in support of policies that ensure innovation remains the strategic advantage of the United States of America. <BR><BR>“As we prepare to celebrate our nation’s 235th birthday on July 4th, CEA’s Innovation Movement is calling on all Americans to sign our Declaration of Innovation, pledging to return innovation to its rightful place as the center of America’s economic policy,” Shapiro said. <BR><BR>“The key priorities of CEA’s Innovation Movement – free trade, skilled immigration, spectrum and lower deficits – are echoed by Democrats and Republicans alike, from President Obama’s State of the Union address to the House Republican Technology Working Group’s 2011 Technology Priorities. The American economy may be struggling, but innovation is our way forward.” <BR><BR>Shapiro made this announcement in his keynote address as part of CE Week in New York City, the consumer electronic industry’s new technology showcase and citywide industry celebration of the products and services that are driving the U.S. economy. <BR><BR>CEA’s Innovation Movement urges lawmakers to support policies that promote innovation. The Declaration of Innovation specifically states: 
<UL class=text>
<LI class=text>“We believe American innovators should be able to buy and sell their products around the world. </LI>
<LI class=text>“We believe that more spectrum must be available for wireless broadband. </LI>
<LI class=text>“We believe in welcoming the best and brightest minds to the United States. </LI>
<LI class=text>“We believe in cutting the federal deficit.” <BR></LI></UL>
<P>CEA’s Innovation Movement is conducting grassroots outreach across the country to encourage Americans to sign the Declaration of Innovation and learn more about why now is the time to stand up for innovation. The effort will include social media engagement allowing Americans to tell personal stories about innovation, as well as traditional and online advertising.<BR><BR>An ad introducing The Declaration of Innovation ran today in the Wall Street Journal. Print and online ads will also run in Capitol Hill publications The Hill, National Journal, Politico, and The Weekly Standard. <BR><BR>As explained in CEA’s recently published book, “The Comeback: How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream” (Beaufort, 2011), authored by Gary Shapiro, the key to America’s leading position in the global marketplace has always been its strength in innovation. Evoking the spirit of the Founding Fathers, CEA’s Innovation Movement calls for the public to sign the Declaration of Innovation and join a national movement committed to keeping America on top.&nbsp; <BR><BR>For more information on the Declaration of Innovation and CEA’s Innovation Movement, visit <A href="http://www.DeclareInnovation.com">www.DeclareInnovation.com</A> and <A href="http://www.facebook.com/InnovationMovement">www.facebook.com/InnovationMovement</A>.</P>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Senator Tom Coburn M.D., Representative Anna Eshoo and Dr. Robert Kahn to be Honored at CEA's Digital Patriots Dinner</div>
        <span class="smallText">Apr 05, 2011 11:27:30</span>
        
        
        <p>Sen. Tom A. Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) and Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA) will be recognized for their unwavering support of technology innovation during the seventh annual Digital Patriots Dinner on May 11. They will join Dr. Robert E. Kahn, chairman, CEO and president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), in receiving their awards at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. <br />
        <br />
        “The Digital Patriots Dinner honors policy leaders and industry visionaries who are passionate about technology. They know that our industry creates jobs, improves our lives and drives the American economy” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. “We are excited to recognize the 2011 Digital Patriots for their contributions to advancing innovation. By helping to create the internet, Dr. Kahn enabled our digital age. Through their work in Congress, Senator Coburn and Representative Eshoo ensure our public policies allow us to be the world’s innovation leader.” <br />
        <br />
        Tom A. Coburn, M.D. was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 2, 2004. Dr. Coburn's priorities in the Senate include reducing spending, protecting liberties, balancing the budget and improving health care access and affordability. He is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Committee on Finance. In 2006, Dr. Coburn teamed up with then-Senator Barack Obama to create USAspending.gov, an online database of all federal spending. Prior to his election to the Senate, Dr. Coburn represented Oklahoma's Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives from 1995 through 2001. <br />
        <br />
        Anna G. Eshoo was first sworn in as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1993. For nearly two decades in Congress she has defended consumers, promoted American competitiveness and innovation, fought for access to health care, protected the environment and encouraged development of clean energy technology. Rep. Eshoo has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee since 1995 and is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, which has primary jurisdiction over the Internet and telecommunications. Rep. Eshoo also co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus, the NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus and the House Medical Technology Caucus, and serves as Vice Chair of the 21st Century Health Care Caucus. <br />
        <br />
        Robert E. Kahn founded CNRI in 1986 as a not-for-profit organization to provide leadership and funding for research and development for the National Information Infrastructure. In 1972, Dr. Kahn moved to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and subsequently became Director of DARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). Dr. Kahn conceived the idea of open-architecture networking and is a co-inventor of the TCP/IP protocols. Dr. Kahn also coined the term National Information Infrastructure (NII), which later became more widely known as the Information Super Highway. In December 1997, President Clinton presented the U.S. National Medal of Technology to Dr. Kahn and Vinton G. Cerf for founding and developing the Internet. They both received various other awards including the ACM Turing Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush in 2005. <br />
        <br />
        All proceeds from the Digital Patriots Dinner ticket sales and sponsorships will be donated directly to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program by CEA. The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (also known as the D.C. School Choice Incentive Program) was created in 2004 to provide low-income parents residing in the District of Columbia with expanded options for the education of their children. It is the first federally-funded K-12 scholarship program in the nation’s history. <br />
        <br />
        The Digital Patriots Dinner will be held in conjunction with CES on the Hill, scheduled May 10 at the Eastern Market in D.C., which will showcase cutting-edge innovations and demonstrate policy issues affecting the consumer technology industry.

        <span class="smallText">Feb 25, 2011 05:09:04</span>
        
        <P>Innovation is our business.&nbsp;It is integral to the apps, services, content and products that our members create, boosting the economy, creating jobs, and making us safer, connected, entertained, educated and informed.&nbsp;<BR><BR>But innovation runs a year-round, 24/7 cycle.<BR><BR>That's why CEA is innovating as well with the launch of a mid-year 2011 plan to promote our industry, our new products and our achievements before a world audience during CEA's new CE Week in New York, June 20-24. It's simply the right place at the right time to prepare the media and trade for the all-important Q4 product launches and holiday messaging.&nbsp;CE Week is going to be an entirely new launch pad for your company. Just like other industries (ie, fashion) have aggregated their product line launches in New York, CE Week will grow, take over multiple venues, and create a convenient and collegial atmosphere for the media and trade to "take Manhattan" and tell our mid-year story to the world.&nbsp;There are already several great ways for your company to get started:</P>
<UL class=text>
<LI class=text>Join us at CEA Line Shows on 34th St. (June 22-23). It's CE Week Headquarters, so it'll be the primary traffic destination and meeting point, and our Digital Downtown Conference Chair Natali del Conte Morris is already recruiting an A-List of journalists to help out on the content. Last year the floor sold out, so act early on this one.</LI>
<LI class=text>We've expanded to an All-Suites Hotel (the Affinia Manhattan) on 7th Ave. (across from Penn Station) where we're hosting the CEA Demo Suites (June 21-22), home of a variety of residential technologies, home theater and audiophile demonstrations.&nbsp;Maureen Jensen of CustomRetailer is producing the conference program at this venue.</LI>
<LI class=text>Or you can do your own thing! The great part of CE Week is that it is infinitely customizable.&nbsp;There's simply no excuse not to participate.&nbsp;All official CE Week partner events benefit from central marketing, transportation and scheduling support. Using our industry’s own tools — social media, mobile electronics and the power of the web — we can stay connected during CE Week even though we're not in a single convention facility, and collectively, we can turn New York City into our industry's stage at this vital time of year.&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P class=text>Join us in New York in June.&nbsp;Together we can innovate a new type of trade event and turn CE Week into our industry "mid-year showcase."<BR><BR>We hope to see you there!<BR><BR>Gary Shapiro<BR>President and CEO<BR>Consumer Electronics Association<BR></P>

        <div class="sub-content-header">2012 CES iLounge Pavilion Sells Out in Record Time: Additional Space Added to Meet Demand</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 27, 2011 12:24:08</span>
        
        <P>The 2012 International CES iLounge Pavilion, sponsored by iLounge.com, sold out in less than two hours during CES exhibitor space selection earlier this January. The 2012 iLounge Pavilion, already featuring 50,000 net square feet of exhibit space (similar to the pavilion's space at the 2011 CES), will showcase a record-setting display of accessories and software for Apple's iPad, iPhone, iPod and Macintosh platforms. Owned and produced by CEA, the 2012 International CES will run January 10-13 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <BR><BR>"The iLounge Pavilion is experiencing unparalleled success and has undoubtedly established itself as the center of the "i" Universe," said Karen Chupka, senior vice president, events and conferences, CEA. “Exhibitors made their intentions loud and clear in purchasing more iLounge space in two hours of space selection than ever before. It's evident that there is strong industry demand for a showcase of these popular products at the International CES, and space for the iLounge Pavilion will increase as a result." <BR><BR>The 2011 iLounge Pavilion featured more than 200 exhibitors across 50,000 net square feet and launched thousands of new products, including Griffin's breakthrough CarTrip and Crayola Stylus application-aided accessories, Mophie’s iPad charging and mounting accessory PowerStand and the app-controlled Sphero robotic ball from Orbotix. From plug-ins to fashion cases, speakers, earphones, games and apps, these products and hundreds of others established the iLounge Pavilion as the world’s leading destination for new i-related product debuts. <BR><BR>"Our CES experience was amazing. We couldn’t have dreamt of a better place to release our new product, and I do not mean just CES, I mean in the iLounge Pavilion," said Michael Shumski, CEO, of start-up KIOKY.&nbsp; "We were swarmed with American distributors, but took the company global the day we launched! Look for us there next year because we made sure to reserve our space again." <BR><BR>New products for the next generation iPad will join iPod, iPhone and Mac offerings in the pavilion, which provides retailers, vendors and more than 5,000 media an unparalleled opportunity to preview the year’s most exciting new i-related technologies in one centralized location. <BR><BR>"CES is the Super Bowl of electronics tradeshows, and nothing else really matters," said Mike Szymczak, co-founder of OrigAudio. "We are happy to be presenting our latest and greatest products on a stage such as CES in the iLounge Pavilion." <BR><BR>Companies interested in exhibiting in the growing 2012 iLounge Pavilion should contact Tira Gordon, senior account executive for CES, at <A href="mailto:tgordon@CE.org">tgordon@CE.org</A>. Attendee registration for the 2012 International CES, the world’s largest consumer technology tradeshow, will begin this summer. For more information on the International CES, visit CESweb.org. </P>

        <span class="smallText">Jan 08, 2011 01:56:22</span>
        
        <P></P>
<P>A keynote address from Ford CEO Alan Mulally, the Innovation Power Panel with leaders from Cisco, GE and Xerox, along with the first-ever Entertainment Matters keynote panel were the day two highlights of the 2011 International CES. Owned and produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)<SUP>®</SUP>, the 2011 CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, runs through Sunday in Las Vegas.</P>
<P>Friday morning's <A href="/events/keynotes.asp">CES Innovation Power Panel keynote</A> provided a unique discussion with three U.S. business luminaries -- Ursula Burns, Chairman and CEO of Xerox; John Chambers, Chairman and CEO of Cisco and Jeffrey Immelt, Chairman and CEO of GE.&nbsp;Moderated by CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro, the Innovation Power Panel discussion included many issues that affect American businesses' ability to innovate, including the U.S. education system, trade and exports, immigration policy and tax policy.</P>
<P>On education, the panelists agreed the U.S. K-12 system is broken.&nbsp;They recommended a measurable program with ambitious goals that would move the U.S. education to the top five in the world, from the top 30. Panelists agreed that the U.S. needs an immigration policy that encourages the best and the brightest not only to come attend college, but also to start companies in the U.S. and remain.</P>
<P>Burns expressed dismay about the process of the Korea Free Trade Agreement, noting that she's on President Obama's Export Council, and called so much of the information she receives "illogical." Noting that innovation can help grow our economy if the right public policies are adopted, Chambers cited with approval many themes from Gary Shapiro's new book, <A href="/news/thecomeback.asp">"<EM>The Comeback:&nbsp; How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream</EM>."&nbsp;</A>The panel agreed with Chambers' observation that the U.S. is at point of inflection, a tipping point, emphasizing that for all of these issues, we have "got to do better job of government and business working together."</P>
<P>Alan Mulally, president and CEO of the Ford Motor Company, took to the stage for the second morning keynote. Mulally introduced the Ford Focus Electric, Ford's first electric vehicle and the first car the company has unveiled at CES. Mulally announced that Ford will have five electric vehicles in the U.S. by 2012.</P>
<P>"Today we are plugging in more than electric cars, but the whole Ford company," said Mulally.&nbsp;The Ford Focus Electric will charge in just over three hours using a 240 volt outlet. Owners will be able to use Value Charging Powered by Microsoft, which will only charge the vehicle when utility rates are at the absolute lowest.</P>
<P>The Entertainment Matters keynote panel, moderated by Michael Kassan, chairman and CEO of MediaLink, featured Akamai's David Kenny, The Coca-Cola Company's Joseph Tripodi, Interpublic Group's&nbsp; Michael Roth, Microsoft's Mich Mathews&nbsp;and WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell. The executives discussed the interconnection between technology and marketing, the need to leverage technology to build brand and engage customers and the challenge of managing communities rather than exclusively pushing content. Kenny encouraged companies to develop technological strength because "great innovation comes from companies that have depth."</P>
<P>This afternoon's one-on-one session with the FCC chairman Julius Genachowski and CEA's Shapiro discussed developments in broadband, spectrum reform, competition policy and other issues impacting the consumer electronics industry.&nbsp; Genachowski began by discussing spectrum saying, "what's happening here at CES so strongly illustrates both the immense opportunity and the critical challenge around this vital public resource."</P>
<P>Genachowski concluded, "To the hundreds of companies and groups that have called for incentive auctions, I share your vision of what's necessary for U.S. leadership in mobile. I look forward to working together to fight for our future."</P>
<P>At a morning SuperSession, <STRONG>Big Thinkers Disruptive Technologies,</STRONG> panelists from AT&amp;T, Zoran Corp., NVIDIA, Real D and Synaptics pointed to advancements in smartphones and tablets, cloud computing and wireless connectivity. Ted Theocheung, vice president of the PC and digital home division at Synaptics, remarked that tablets acting as remote controls will compel consumers to be more interactive with content.</P>
<P>The final SuperSession, <STRONG>Consumer 360 – Gadgets Everywhere and the Role of Wireless,</STRONG>was moderated by Rajeev Chand, Managing Director and Head of Research, Rutberg &amp; Company, LLC.&nbsp;The panel featured executives from GM, Intel, AT&amp;T, Motorola Mobility and Best Buy's The Geek Squad.&nbsp; The group had a wide-ranging conversation about the role wireless networks will play with emerging devices, like tablets.&nbsp;The panelists agreed that at some point in the near future,&nbsp;consumers will be able to access all of their content anywhere, anytime across multiple devices.</P>

<P>In addition, Gary Shapiro will be signing copies of hisbook at the following locations on-site at the 2011 International CES:</P>
<UL class=text>
<LI class=text>10 a.m. Thursday, Jan. 6: Las Vegas Hilton Center Lobby</LI>

<LI class=text>10 a.m. Saturday, Jan. 8: Barnes &amp; Noble Booth, LVCC, Grand Lobby</LI></UL>
<P>Here's a sneak peek: <BR><BR>America seems to be on a downward slide. Our government spends too much; our economy creates too little; and we aren’t preparing our children to compete in a global marketplace. Yet our politicians – Republican and Democrat alike – just don’t get it. While once-great cities fall into decay, Washington thrives, living off the hard work and tax dollars of the private sector. <BR><BR>It’s time for an American comeback -- and it starts with innovation.<BR><BR>Throughout its history, America’s great innovators have been the drivers of our unsurpassed economic success. American innovation transformed a country of ragtag farmers into the epicenter of the world’s technological progress. Innovation creates jobs, markets, and new industries where none existed before. Most importantly, innovation moves us forward as a nation, pushing us to succeed and strive for a better tomorrow. In short, innovation is the American Dream. <BR><BR>In The Comeback, Gary Shapiro shows us how to return innovation to its rightful place at the center of America’s economic policy. The Comeback is a new blueprint for America’s success.</P>

        <div class="sub-content-header">CEA Releases Sustainability Report, Highlights Tremendous Progress Industry has Made in Green Initiatives</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jan 05, 2011 05:28:21</span>
        
        <P>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) recently released the CEA 2010 Sustainability Report to highlight the tremendous progress the industry has made in its green initiatives, from designing more energy efficient products to cutting greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at facilities, to developing a national electronics recycling infrastructure. <BR><BR>The report, an update to CEA's first-ever sustainability report in 2008, tracks the industry's green efforts throughout a consumer electronics (CE) product’s entire lifecycle. The CEA 2010 Sustainability Report contains 21 separate case studies from a variety of CE companies illustrating progress in their environmental efforts. The report further provides transparency on green practices across the industry. <BR><BR>"The consumer electronics industry is committed to greening its products and practices for the benefit of consumers, communities and the overall environment," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA. "In the past three years, we’ve made great strides in our environmental efforts, by creating more green products, improving energy efficiency and deepening our commitment to electronics recycling. We know there is work remaining, and we will press forward with these initiatives in 2011 and beyond."<BR><BR>Following are some highlights of environmental progress evidenced in the report:&nbsp; <BR><BR><STRONG>Greener designs: </STRONG>Industry-wide unit sales of U.S. products registered with EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) grew by 10 percent in 2009, to a total of 48.5 million products. Individual companies also made noteworthy milestones in green design. One manufacturer, for instance, conducted a comprehensive life cycle analysis for every product it ships to determine where greenhouse gases are created. After discovering 97 percent of the emission derived from manufacturing and product use, the company focused on designing new products that use less material, smaller packaging, and are as energy efficient and recyclable as possible. <BR><BR><STRONG>Green packaging: </STRONG>Many consumer electronics companies are switching to renewable materials, including bio-based plastics, or recyclable materials instead of clamshell packaging and are looking to reduce the amount of packaging they use. For instance, one video service provider consolidated its shipments and decreased its use of cartons by more than one million in 2009 — a 75 percent reduction from the previous year. In 2011, all of the providers' products will be packed with 100 percent recyclable materials. <BR><BR><STRONG>More efficient facilities: </STRONG>Many manufacturers have set ambitious goals for reducing GHG at their facilities. Meanwhile, other companies have launched efforts to cut power consumption at their data centers. <BR><BR><STRONG>More energy efficient products:</STRONG> According to the EPA, 27,000 CE product models currently meet ENERGY STAR specifications. The average energy savings of ENERGY STAR electronics devices range from 20 to 55 percent. An example of this progress is one semiconductor design company created a chip that can reduce its GHG by up to 40 percent by combining the processing and graphics processing units and the Northbridge chipset onto a single chip. <BR><BR><STRONG>eCycling: </STRONG>The consumer electronics industry recycled 200 million pounds in 2009, and industry supports more than 5,000 permanent collection sites nationwide. Some examples of these efforts include one CE retailer collecting 100 million pounds at its 1,200 U.S. locations and one computer manufacturer operating an eCycling program at more than 2,200 U.S. Goodwill sites. <BR><BR>"The CE industry’s commitment to sustainability is unmistakable," said Walter Alcorn, CEA's vice president of environmental affairs and industry sustainability. "More and more, our member companies are finding what makes good environmental sense also makes good business sense in the form of reduced costs and invigorated employees. Our sustainability efforts will continue in earnest this year, and CEA will continue to provide the resources to member companies to help bolster these initiatives."<BR><BR>The full report is available at <A href="http://www.CE.org/green" target=_blank>www.CE.org/green</A>.<BR></P>

Social networking tools can help make this happen by better connecting people. <BR><BR>For the past several years, <A href="http://www.CESweb.org">the International CES </A>has been a leading user of social media tools to promote the tradeshow, its exhibitors and all the amazing events and product launches. This includes utilizing social media and location-based marketing tools like mobile apps, the <A href="http://blog.ce.org/">CEA blog – Digital Dialogue</A>, <A href="http://CESweb.org/twitter">Twitter</A> and <A href="http://www.CESweb.org/facebook">Facebook</A>, to reach attendees and exhibitors, before, during and after the show. <BR><BR>More than 10,000 industry professionals <A href="http://blog.ce.org/" target=_blank>visit CEA’s Digital Dialogue</A> each month leading up to the International CES to learn about the latest product trends expected on the show floor.&nbsp; Additionally, the CEA and CES Facebook pages connect people throughout the year and provide the latest news. And while CEA uses Twitter to reach CES attendees, it isn’t the only one who thinks the International CES is worth tweeting about – at the end of the first day of the 2010 International CES, there were 25,000 tweets referencing <A href="http://www.CESweb.org/twitter">#CES on Twitter.<BR></A><BR>These social media tools help to make navigating the 2011 International CES show floor as easy as possible. For the upcoming show, CEA is partnering with Core-Apps to produce a new mobile app.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.CESweb.org/followme">The Follow Me app</A> allows CES attendees to link to their friends’ CES schedules, provides interactive floor maps with routing to booths, and allows for social media and downloading exhibitor information directly from mobile devices.<BR><BR>Follow Me is free and has a native app for Apple, BlackBerry and Android devices, in addition to the Follow Me Web app for other Internet-ready phones.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Through social media, CES attendees and exhibitors can learn about the show with the touch of a button.

        <P>As a side-effect of the economy, consumers are enhancing and upgrading their stay-at-home experiences, especially as CE intersects with the kitchen. <BR><BR>Attractively styled high-def flat screens together with Internet connectivity, Blu-ray players and other components have taken the drag out of staying-at-home. People are experiencing the thrill of the movie theater in the comfort of a home theater or den. At some point, attention turns to munchies – and the kitchen. “What do we have to eat?”<BR><BR>The kitchen has always held a symbolic place at the center of the home. Most people fondly remember the smells of a Sunday dinner and the comfortable chitchat in the kitchen. For a while it seemed as if the kitchen got lost amidst the beauty of flat-screen TVs, videogame consoles and more – but now the kitchen is making a come-back. <BR><BR><A href="http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cea/vision1110/#/10" target=_blank>Read the full story by Sue Schreine in the November/December 2010 issue of <EM>CE Vision Magazine.</EM></A><BR></P>

        <span class="smallText">Nov 29, 2010 10:48:29</span>
        
        <P>The Comeback: How Innovation will Restore the American Dream, a new book by Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) President and CEO Gary Shapiro is <A href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/product.aspx?r=1&isbn=9780825305627" target=_blank>now available through Barnes&nbsp;& Noble for pre-order</A>. <BR><BR>Here's a sneak peek: <BR><BR>America seems to be on a downward slide. Our government spends too much; our economy creates too little; and we aren’t preparing our children to compete in a global marketplace. Yet our politicians – Republican and Democrat alike – just don’t get it. While once-great cities fall into decay, Washington thrives, living off the hard work and tax dollars of the private sector. <BR><BR>It’s time for an American comeback -- and it starts with innovation.<BR><BR>Throughout its history, America’s great innovators have been the drivers of our unsurpassed economic success. American innovation transformed a country of ragtag farmers into the epicenter of the world’s technological progress. Innovation creates jobs, markets, and new industries where none existed before. Most importantly, innovation moves us forward as a nation, pushing us to succeed and strive for a better tomorrow. In short, innovation is the American Dream. <BR><BR>In <A href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/product.aspx?r=1&isbn=9780825305627">The Comeback</A>, Gary Shapiro shows us how to return innovation to its rightful place at the center of America’s economic policy. The Comeback is a new blueprint for America’s success.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
