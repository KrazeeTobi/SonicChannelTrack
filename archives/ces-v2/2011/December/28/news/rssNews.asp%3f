        <div class="sub-content-header">Eureka Park TechZone Triples Since Launch</div>
        <span class="smallText">Dec 21, 2011 10:33:50</span>
        
        
        Ninety-four companies will exhibit in the new Eureka Park TechZone at the 2012 International CES, a dedicated area in partnership with the National Science Foundation, Startup America Partnership, CNET and UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), showcasing innovative start-ups and entrepreneurs. Owned and produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, the 2012 International CES®, the world’s largest tradeshow for consumer technology, is scheduled January 10-13, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br />
        <br />
        “Entrepreneurship is a driving force in today’s economy, and exhibiting at CES is a great way for growing companies to gain recognition in the CE industry,” said Karen Chupka, senior vice president, events and conferences, CEA. “We are thrilled to see the overwhelming response from companies interested in exhibiting within the Eureka Park TechZone since its initial launch in June. This new area at the 2012 CES will be a must-see for CES attendees.”<br />
        <br />
        The Eureka Park TechZone, located in <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/by-hall.asp">The Venetian</a>, launched in June 2011 with 28 companies signed on to exhibit. The area has since grown to include 94 companies, spanning more than 9,000 net square feet of exhibit space.<br />
        <br />
        <a  href="http://www.cesweb.org/showFloor/techzones.asp#Eureka-Park">The Eureka Park TechZone</a> is designed to benefit budding entrepreneurs, fledgling start-ups, home grown innovation and small companies looking to gain footing in the consumer electronics industry. The Venetian will also feature CES keynotes and the Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase, as well as Eureka Park, a hot spot for venture capitalists, investors, media and more than 140,000 industry professionals looking for the next big thing in technology.<br />
        <br />
        In November, UKTI hosted a competition at its event, TechWorld, with the top three innovative companies awarded space within the Eureka Park TechZone at the 2012 CES. Winners included UK-based Blippar, Stereo Grafix and Yoskhi, which will be among the 94 companies exhibiting within Eureka Park.<br />
        <br />
        CEA recently announced its collaboration with the Startup America Partnership, an independent nonprofit entity launched at the White House in 2011 to help young companies succeed in order to accelerate job growth in America. Several Startup America Firms will exhibit in Eureka Park.<br />
        <br />
        The 2012 CES will feature <a  href="/showFloor/techzones.asp">more than 25 market-specific TechZones</a> covering product categories such as broadband services, safe driving and sustainable technologies. Companies interested in exhibiting in the Eureka Park TechZone should contact Kristen Nafziger at knafzgier@CE.org or 703-907-7648.

        <div class="sub-content-header">Sustainability Efforts Ramp Up for 2012 International CES</div>
        <span class="smallText">Dec 19, 2011 01:53:33</span>
        
        
        <p>The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), owner and producer of the 2012 International CES, announced the adoption of several new sustainability practices at the 2012 CES, the world’s largest technology tradeshow, to be held in Las Vegas January 10-13.<br />
        <br />
        New this year, attendee badge holders are made from repurposed vinyl show banners from last year’s show, and CEA will collect those badge holders at the end of the 2012 CES to recycle them again. Furthermore, CES general services contractor Global Experience Specialists (GES) will produce signs using a reusable, recyclable kraft paper honeycomb material. CEA will also seek to collect even more magnetic, vinyl and cardboard show signs for repurposing through a partnership with Repurpose America, a local nonprofit focusing on tradeshow recycling.<br />
        <br />
        Last year, Repurpose America collected roughly 18,000 pounds of magnetic signs from the 2011 CES, nearly 15,000 square feet of vinyl banners and more than 150 foam boards. In addition, CEA worked with contractors to recycle 289.6 tons of the solid waste generated at CES and increased the event’s recycle rate from 68 percent to 77 percent, several points higher than the average recycle rate of trade shows held at the Las Vegas Convention Center.<br />
        <br />
        “Our green and recycling efforts at the 2012 International CES are unprecedented for the largest annual event in the western hemisphere, covering more than 1.8 million square feet and welcoming more than140,000 attendees,” said Gary Shapiro, CEA president and CEO. “We’ve worked hard to ensure that we are using the latest and greatest sustainability practices in producing CES.”<br />
        <br />
        Along with the greening of the International CES, CEA also supports local green nonprofits. Last year, CEA gave $75,000 to Green Chips, a local Las Vegas charity supporting solar power installations. That money was used to install solar panels at a Las Vegas non-profit facility, resulting in substantial savings that allowed the organization to devote more money to serve those in need. CEA plans to make another donation benefiting Las Vegas and the environment at the 2012 International CES.<br />
        <br />
        The International CES also allows attendees to reduce their carbon footprint by gathering in one location. With each attendee reporting an average of 12 business meetings per CES, CES participants collectively avoid more than 960 million miles in business trips that they otherwise would have to take. As a result of attending CES and consolidating trips, the estimated net savings in travel is more than 549 million miles.<br />
        <br />

        "The dramatic growth of smartphones and tablets, and Microsoft’s support of Windows on ARM-based processors, firmly establishes mobile as the computing platform of today," said Jacobs. "Emerging countries are now adopting mobile technologies on a huge scale. This creates tremendous growth opportunities in the consumer electronics and computing industries around the world. Qualcomm is helping drive these opportunities through our Snapdragon processors and other mobile innovations."<br />
        <br />
        The TEC Program at CES shines a spotlight on technology's critical role in enabling economic, social and political empowerment opportunities for evolving countries and their citizens. Additional TEC sessions will be announced later this fall.<br />
        <br />
        Jacobs joins other confirmed <a  href="http://cesweb.org/events/keynotes.asp">2012 CES keynoters</a> including Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, Ericsson's Hans Vestberg and Daimler's Dr. Dieter Zetsche. Additional CES keynotes will be announced later this fall.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Registration Open for 2012 CES Mobile Apps Showdown</div>
        <span class="smallText">Sep 14, 2011 11:18:15</span>
        
        
        <p>Registration has opened for the <a  href="/events/mobile-apps.asp">Mobile Apps Showdown at the 2012 International CES</a>, the world’s largest consumer technology tradeshow scheduled for January 10-13, 2012. Now in its third year at the International CES, this event, honoring the best smartphone and tablet apps, will take place on Thursday, January 12, 2012.<br />
        <br />
        Judges will select 10 finalists for the apps competition, which will take place live at the 2012 CES and online. Two winners will be selected, one based on a live vote at the 2012 CES and the other based on online voters at the site.<br />
        <br />
        “Mobile Apps Showdown is designed to be as entertaining as it is exciting,“ said Robin Raskin, founder of the Mobile Apps Showdown. “The exposure that an apps developer gets from the website presence, press coverage and social media will be amazing.”<br />
        <br />
        “The Apps numbers speak for themselves,” adds Karen Chupka, senior vice president of events and conferences at CEA, the producer of the International CES. “Apple boasts 225,000 apps and in the latest reports, Android now has a similar number. Add Blackberry RIM and Microsoft Mobile to the equation and you’ve got quite a contest. The 2012 International CES is the best place to see the latest apps and we’re excited to help showcase the mobile apps explosion.”<br />
        <br />
        <a  href="/events/mobile-apps.asp">Nominations for the competition are now open.</a> Developers can submit entries to be judged by a panel of tech experts including <a  target="_blank" href="http://ginasmith.typepad.com/">Gina Smith</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.chrisnull.com">Christopher Null</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.chipchick.com">Helena Stone</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.coolhotnot.com">Dave Whittle</a> and other industry notables. Ten finalists will have a chance to present on stage at the 2012 International CES, held January 10-13, 2012, in Las Vegas. Readers of the Mobile Apps Showdown website will have a chance to try the apps and vote for the people’s choice award. Winners will be awarded based on audience response, both online and live at the Las Vegas Convention Center at 2:30 p.m. PT on Thursday, January 12, 2012.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Special Hosts Gary Dell’Abate And Jon Hein Add To The Fun <br />
        </strong>Co-hosts and fellow techies Gary Dell’Abate and Jon Hein, from SiriusXM Radio's Howard Stern channels, will once again bring their inimitable wit and knowledge of all things geek to the festivities. For extra fun, they’ll lead a rollicking trivia contest. Want to see last year’s fun? <a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpaHgPAgooI">Watch the Gary/Jon show in action.</a> All contestants will be available to show their apps at a “meet up” immediately following the event. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Winners of the 2011 CES Mobile Apps Showdown <br />
        </strong>Last year’s mobile apps winners have gone on to become two of the most successful apps on the market today. <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.drivesafe.ly/">DriveSafe.ly 2.0</a>, an app that addresses the hazards of road distraction, won based on audience applause. <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.line2.com/">Line2</a>, which gives smartphone users a second line, won the online ballot with over 50,000 votes. <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.clixtr.com/">Clixtr</a> and <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.gwabbit.com/">Gwabbit</a>, winners in 2010, have gone on to rank as some of the top selling apps and still feature its Mobile Apps Showdown Award prominently. Good apps. Good business.</p>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Grassroots Campaign Calls for Americans to Sign and Show Support for Innovation</div>
        <span class="smallText">Jun 23, 2011 01:03:55</span>
        
        Today Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the <A href="http://www.CE.org" target=_blank>Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, </A>announced the launch of the <A href="http://www.DeclareInnovation.com " target=_blank>Declaration of Innovation</A>, an online pledge for Americans to sign in support of policies that ensure innovation remains the strategic advantage of the United States of America. <BR><BR>“As we prepare to celebrate our nation’s 235th birthday on July 4th, CEA’s Innovation Movement is calling on all Americans to sign our Declaration of Innovation, pledging to return innovation to its rightful place as the center of America’s economic policy,” Shapiro said. <BR><BR>“The key priorities of CEA’s Innovation Movement – free trade, skilled immigration, spectrum and lower deficits – are echoed by Democrats and Republicans alike, from President Obama’s State of the Union address to the House Republican Technology Working Group’s 2011 Technology Priorities. The American economy may be struggling, but innovation is our way forward.” <BR><BR>Shapiro made this announcement in his keynote address as part of CE Week in New York City, the consumer electronic industry’s new technology showcase and citywide industry celebration of the products and services that are driving the U.S. economy. <BR><BR>CEA’s Innovation Movement urges lawmakers to support policies that promote innovation. The Declaration of Innovation specifically states: 
<UL class=text>
<LI class=text>“We believe American innovators should be able to buy and sell their products around the world. </LI>
<LI class=text>“We believe that more spectrum must be available for wireless broadband. </LI>
<LI class=text>“We believe in welcoming the best and brightest minds to the United States. </LI>
<LI class=text>“We believe in cutting the federal deficit.” <BR></LI></UL>
<P>CEA’s Innovation Movement is conducting grassroots outreach across the country to encourage Americans to sign the Declaration of Innovation and learn more about why now is the time to stand up for innovation. The effort will include social media engagement allowing Americans to tell personal stories about innovation, as well as traditional and online advertising.<BR><BR>An ad introducing The Declaration of Innovation ran today in the Wall Street Journal. Print and online ads will also run in Capitol Hill publications The Hill, National Journal, Politico, and The Weekly Standard. <BR><BR>As explained in CEA’s recently published book, “The Comeback: How Innovation Will Restore the American Dream” (Beaufort, 2011), authored by Gary Shapiro, the key to America’s leading position in the global marketplace has always been its strength in innovation. Evoking the spirit of the Founding Fathers, CEA’s Innovation Movement calls for the public to sign the Declaration of Innovation and join a national movement committed to keeping America on top.&nbsp; <BR><BR>For more information on the Declaration of Innovation and CEA’s Innovation Movement, visit <A href="http://www.DeclareInnovation.com">www.DeclareInnovation.com</A> and <A href="http://www.facebook.com/InnovationMovement">www.facebook.com/InnovationMovement</A>.</P>

        <div class="sub-content-header">Senator Tom Coburn M.D., Representative Anna Eshoo and Dr. Robert Kahn to be Honored at CEA's Digital Patriots Dinner</div>
        <span class="smallText">Apr 05, 2011 11:27:30</span>
        
        
        <p>Sen. Tom A. Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) and Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA) will be recognized for their unwavering support of technology innovation during the seventh annual Digital Patriots Dinner on May 11. They will join Dr. Robert E. Kahn, chairman, CEO and president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), in receiving their awards at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. <br />
        <br />
        “The Digital Patriots Dinner honors policy leaders and industry visionaries who are passionate about technology. They know that our industry creates jobs, improves our lives and drives the American economy” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. “We are excited to recognize the 2011 Digital Patriots for their contributions to advancing innovation. By helping to create the internet, Dr. Kahn enabled our digital age. Through their work in Congress, Senator Coburn and Representative Eshoo ensure our public policies allow us to be the world’s innovation leader.” <br />
        <br />
        Tom A. Coburn, M.D. was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 2, 2004. Dr. Coburn's priorities in the Senate include reducing spending, protecting liberties, balancing the budget and improving health care access and affordability. He is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Committee on Finance. In 2006, Dr. Coburn teamed up with then-Senator Barack Obama to create USAspending.gov, an online database of all federal spending. Prior to his election to the Senate, Dr. Coburn represented Oklahoma's Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives from 1995 through 2001. <br />
        <br />
        Anna G. Eshoo was first sworn in as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1993. For nearly two decades in Congress she has defended consumers, promoted American competitiveness and innovation, fought for access to health care, protected the environment and encouraged development of clean energy technology. Rep. Eshoo has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee since 1995 and is Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, which has primary jurisdiction over the Internet and telecommunications. Rep. Eshoo also co-chairs the Congressional Internet Caucus, the NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus and the House Medical Technology Caucus, and serves as Vice Chair of the 21st Century Health Care Caucus. <br />
        <br />
        Robert E. Kahn founded CNRI in 1986 as a not-for-profit organization to provide leadership and funding for research and development for the National Information Infrastructure. In 1972, Dr. Kahn moved to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and subsequently became Director of DARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). Dr. Kahn conceived the idea of open-architecture networking and is a co-inventor of the TCP/IP protocols. Dr. Kahn also coined the term National Information Infrastructure (NII), which later became more widely known as the Information Super Highway. In December 1997, President Clinton presented the U.S. National Medal of Technology to Dr. Kahn and Vinton G. Cerf for founding and developing the Internet. They both received various other awards including the ACM Turing Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush in 2005. <br />
        <br />
        All proceeds from the Digital Patriots Dinner ticket sales and sponsorships will be donated directly to the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program by CEA. The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (also known as the D.C. School Choice Incentive Program) was created in 2004 to provide low-income parents residing in the District of Columbia with expanded options for the education of their children. It is the first federally-funded K-12 scholarship program in the nation’s history. <br />
        <br />
        The Digital Patriots Dinner will be held in conjunction with CES on the Hill, scheduled May 10 at the Eastern Market in D.C., which will showcase cutting-edge innovations and demonstrate policy issues affecting the consumer technology industry.
