		Greg Weaver entered the industry in 1969 in retail sales. Throughout the 70's and 80's, he grew to supervise a variety of audio shops and small chains, eventually moving on to manage a number of fine audio salons. Also in the 80's, after receiving his digital electronics certificate, he partnered a consumer electronics repair shop where he did everything from designing and installing custom competition IASCA 12-volt systems to repairing computers to designing circuits for coin-operated video arcade games. He has been an industry journalist and product reviewer since the late 1980's, both writing for and editing numerous print and internet journals. He has been an industry consultant for the last decade, working with companies such as Harmonic Technology (Greg lead the team that developed the Magic&trade; line of products), Quantum, and NSR Sonic Research. Greg currently lives in north central Indiana, where he is an IT Engineer at the University of Notre Dame.<br><br />

		Martin Winston is Editor of the longstanding Newstips Bulletin (reaching other journalists who cover consumer electronics) and puts tech products on the air on several Cleveland-area radio and TV stations. He's come to CES for more than 30 years. A self-professed &quot;full-metal geek&quot;, Marty also has earlier credentials in journalism (hundreds of magazine articles, 2 books), retailing (former Radio Shack exec), broadcasting and marketing (writing and producing and directing commercials at ad agencies). He considers himself one of our toughest judges, applying both technical and market criteria to each nominee. When in Las Vegas for CES, Marty makes himself available for at least an hour each side of midnight at the Oculus (&quot;Circle Bar&quot;) in the lobby of The Venetian, often with a Rocky Patel cigar in one hand and a glass of The Macallan (neat) in the other; any bartender or cigar girl can point him out.<br><br />
