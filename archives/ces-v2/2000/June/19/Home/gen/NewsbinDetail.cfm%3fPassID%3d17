	<font size="-1"><b>CES Expands to New Technology Areas and Audiences </b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Jun, 30 1999
	<BR>
	The International CES is expanding to cover more technology areas and audiences.  To be held January 6-9, 2000 in Las Vegas, Nev., the 2000 International CES—Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology will showcase the latest products in workstyle and lifestyle technology such as digital audio and video, information technology, home networking, mobile electronics, wireless communications, content media, delivery systems, e-commerce and accessory products. <P>
“CES is the place where manufacturers, retailers, content providers and creators, broadband developers, installers, engineers, corporate buyers, government leaders, financial analysts and the media from around the world can make sense of the digital millennium,” said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president.  “Although CES continues to have the greatest concentration of retail buyers with 88 percent of the buying power of the industry in attendance, the 2000 show is expanding its reach to new audiences, especially non-retail corporate buyers, financial/market analysts, content providers and creators, broadband developers and government officials.” <P>
Special conference sessions and exhibit areas are being created for these audiences so that they understand the newest advances in digital technology and the latest changes in workstyle and lifestyle technology.  The 2000 International CES will focus on at least 25 product areas with more than a dozen exhibit pavilions spread throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Sands Expo and Convention Center.   <P>
With digital technology creating a bridge between information technology (IT) and traditional consumer electronics (CE) products, consumer technology now is traveling easily between work and home.  Entertainment products are expected to be smarter and multi-functional such as a video entertainment system for the car that now gives drivers navigation directions and links them to the Internet.  At the same time, products traditionally considered business-only now are designed to entertain as well as enhance productivity such as a hand-held PC that offers full-color streaming video.  The blending of environments—convergence—is the heart of workstyle and lifestyle technology at CES.   <P>
To help attendees discover the latest trends, strategies and profit opportunities in the consumer technology industry, the 2000 CES conference program is packed with more than 130 targeted sessions. Conference tracks include workstyle technology, lifestyle technology, mobile/wireless communications, emerging technologies, e-commerce, retail management and the Habitech Institute—the trade and training event for integrated home systems. As the showcase for the who, what, where and why of the consumer technology industry, international visionaries in content media, delivery and hardware at CES will illustrate new business models and new consumer applications made possible by technology. <P>
Digital Hollywood, an event devoted to the convergence of entertainment and technology, also is part of CES.  Digital Hollywood workshops and entertainment-content exhibits will focus on digital media and content production. Geared toward computer and Internet companies; telephone companies; broadcast, cable and satellite executives; and entertainment and studio executives, Digital Hollywood offers a wide variety of seminars, featuring representatives from the entertainment and technology fields.  <P>
More than 1,500 exhibitors are expected to display their latest technologies in four exhibit halls:  the Las Vegas Convention Center—the Center for CES IT, Audio, Video and More; the Sands Expo and Convention Center—the Heartbeat of CES On-The-Go Technologies; the Las Vegas Hilton—Where Home Technologies Are Integrated; and the Alexis Park Hotel—the Headquarters for High-End Audio.  <P>
CES also features Innovations 2000, the prestigious honors showcase of the best products exhibited, judged by a panel of trade press, leading engineers and industrial designers, as the ultimate in design, engineering and software excellence. For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES news and information. <P>
CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES—Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEMA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
