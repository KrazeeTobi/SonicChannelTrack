	The winners of the first official CES Workstyle Awards were announced today at the 2000 International CES.  CES showcases the full range of new workstyle products, including digital imaging, wireless devices, Internet access devices, portable peripherals and hand-held navigational equipment. <P>
Key industry writers were selected to determine this year’s hottest.  The three judges for the 2000 CES Workstyle Awards were Ed Baig from USA Today, Bob Parks of Wired, and Linda Lentz with Home.  Products were judged on-site at CES, using the following criteria:  engineering quality, intended use, unique features, portability, ease of use, design and improvement to the user’s overall workstyle.  Products were separated into five categories and one winner was selected from each. <P>
The establishment of the workstyle awards comes as a result of the way in which CE products continue to change the way people conduct business.  Incorporating technology from the telecom, PC and consumer electronics industries, this new category of products gives workers freedom and flexibility, allowing them to work when and where they want. <P>
