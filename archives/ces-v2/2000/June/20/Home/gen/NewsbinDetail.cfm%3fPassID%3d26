	<p>Arlington, VA - Sep, 20 1999
	<BR>
	To help attendees understand and capitalize on the digitization, convergence and interconnectivity trends in the consumer technology industry, the 2000 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, to be held in Las Vegas, Nev., January 6-9, 2000, will showcase the home networking products and technologies that allow for communication between devices.  Keynote addresses, panel discussions and conference sessions by visionaries from content media, delivery, information technology and hardware communities, will compliment the home network related exhibits and pavilions on the show floor. <P>
"Home networks provide the communications link that lets consumers access the wide variety of content and control features that consumer electronics products provide," explained Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), sponsor, producer and manager of CES.  "Home networking is dissolving the traditional boundaries between consumer electronics products, allowing consumers to access data, information and entertainment when they want it, where they want it."  <P>
Showcasing the growing workstyle and home networking trends in the consumer technology industry, CES will feature four industry leading pioneers as keynoters.  Eric A. Benhamou, chairman and CEO, 3Com Corp.; Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO, Sun Microsystems; Rob Glaser, chairman and CEO, RealNetworks Inc.; and Bill Gates, chairman and CEO, Microsoft Corp., will deliver the Opening Keynote, the Executive Perspective Keynote, the Technology Keynote and the New Millennium Keynote addresses, respectively. <P>
<b>Conference Sessions</b> <P>
Several of the 11 conference tracks will focus on issues relating to home networking and interconnectivity.  Attendees will explore the various types, uses and forms of home network content as well as learn how this content is collected, distributed and delivered in the home.  <P>
<b>The Habitech Institute:</b> Sponsored by CEMA, Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association (CEDIA), Continental Automated Building Association (CABA) and Building Industry Consulting Services International (BICSI), and geared toward custom installers and designers, The Habitech Institute-the trade and training event for integrated home systems-focuses on home theater, systems integration, home LANs, home controls and the business of custom installation and design. Learn what the digital home of the future will look like, how to set up systems for multi-family complexes, how to fish wire between floors, how the new powerline networking options work, what the TechHome rating system is, where to find quality installers, and what new standards and codes are being written.  <P>
<b>Workstyle Technology:</b> Geared to help retailers gain insight into the small business industry, the telecommuting market and other ways consumers work today, this track highlights the technologies that enable consumers to work when, where and how they wish.  <P>
<b>Lifestyle Technology:</b> Delve into the latest developments occurring in convergent products, digital advances in audio and video products, delivery methods and products/technology for the consumer home market such as DTV, DVD, MP3, CD-R, HAVi, Avio, copy protection, personalized TV, flat panel TVs and video games.  This track will keep attendees up-to-date on what's happening in consumers' homes, what new products are on the horizon, and how to link them all together.  <P>
<b>Dataquest Predicts Consumer Technologies:</b> Dataquest provides an in-depth analysis of four technologies impacting the consumer technology marketplace: digital television, home networking and broadband access, mobile computing and wireless technologies and e-commerce. Learn about technology trends for the next three to five years and how companies can take advantage of the business opportunities being created by the digital technology revolution.  <P>
<b>Exhibit Areas</b> <P>
To help attendees navigate the show floor and get the most out of each day, CES is divided into product category sections and technology pavilions.  For the 2000 show, the home networking section will extend from the North Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), to the adjacent Las Vegas Hilton hotel show space.  Communications and information technology products also will be housed in LVCC's North Hall, and the South Hall will be home to the audio and video exhibits.   Home network related pavilions at the 2000 International CES include: <P>
<b>1394:</b> Featuring products designed to communicate via the 1394 communications protocol. <P>
<b>Digital Living Room:</b> Designed to help attendees manage the converging products in the consumer technology arena; Digital lifestyle, workstyle, entertainment, computer and Internet industries intersect here. <P>
<b>Home Security:</b> Highlighting home automation and home security products, including: integrated security systems, identification products, access control systems, intrusion detection devices, perimeter protection systems, CCTV and more. <P>
A wide variety of companies representing all facets of home networking will be exhibiting related products at the show.  Registered exhibitors include: 2 Wire, 3Com Home Networking, ADSL Forum, ADT Security, Broadcom, Cisco, CMI Worldwide, IBM, Intel, Panja (formerly AMX), Smart Corp., Sony, Sun Microsystems, Thomson, Vantage, X-10 and Yamaha.   "The wide variety of products on exhibit at the show and the range of topics covered by Habitech this year, are reflective of how broad the consumer electronics and home networking industries have become," said Peter Lesser, president of X-10.  "CES is the only place to see all of these products come together and learn how they can be integrated into an information and entertainment network." <P>
To further enhance the business opportunities available to the home networking industry at CES, Habitech Institute attendees, CEMA Integrated Home Systems (IHS) Division members and home networking exhibitors are invited to attend the Home Systems Connections Reception from 6:00 - 9:00 pm on Thursday, January 6 (exact location at CES to be announced).  <P>
