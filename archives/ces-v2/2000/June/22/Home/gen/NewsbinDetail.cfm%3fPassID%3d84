	<p>Arlington, VA - Nov, 10 1999
	<BR>
	The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA, formerly CEMA) announces that this January, for the first time, International 2000 CES attendees and exhibitors will see the world's largest annual consumer technology show as they never have before-in high-definition television (HDTV).  CES Today, CEA's daily television program covering the 2000 International CES set for January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nev., will provide HDTV coverage of CES for the first time ever. <P>
"HDTV made its industry debut at CES in 1998.  It's only natural that CES would be the first tradeshow to be produced in HDTV," said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president. "The 2000 CES Today HDTV production will be the most exciting and comprehensive coverage of CES ever. The 2000 International CES is the world's launch pad for the digital millennium." <P>
CEA has chosen New York City-based Gourvitz Communications Inc. to be its official video production vendor for the program. Gourvitz Communications will be responsible for the production of CES Today, originating daily from the Las Vegas Convention Center. <P>
"Known for our expertise in broadcast media services, now we're ready to make history in the television industry with producing the first convention TV program in HDTV," said Paul Gourvitz, president of Gourvitz Communications. "CES Today will provide extensive coverage of CES product introductions and demonstrations, show events, keynote speeches and select conference sessions - and all in HDTV." <P>
To assist in the coverage of the 2000 International CES, Gourvitz Communications has enlisted the editorial talents of Dealerscope Consumer Electronics Marketplace, a leading monthly retail trade magazine based in Philadelphia. <P>
"Dealerscope is working with Gourvitz Communications and CEA to cover the hottest electronic news and lifestyle/workstyle trends at the show," said Janet Pinkerton, Dealerscope's editor-in-chief. "There's no shortage of news at CES-our role is more a matter of making sure that what gets covered on each day's CES Today program is truly the consumer technology news that both the consumer and the electronics industry will benefit from." <P>
CES Today will be a daily one-hour HDTV program that will air during show hours on HDTV monitors positioned throughout the four CES exhibition venues. There will be at least 20 HDTV displays located throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Sands Exposition and Convention Center, Las Vegas Hilton and Alexis Park Resort.  HDTV cable feeds to those monitors will be handled by Turner Engineering. <P>
The CES Today set will be positioned in the Las Vegas Convention Center Grand Lobby to facilitate the taping of panel discussions, executive interviews and product demonstrations, all in high-definition, 1080-I resolution formatted in 16:9 aspect ratio. By utilizing a 53-foot HDTV production truck, Gourvitz Communications will operate as an eight-hour daily television station. Live updates, breaking news and sponsored advertising will be integrated into the programming. The state-of-the-art product truck provides an HDTV control room, HD videotape editing, computerized graphics and air control for the production. Gourvitz Communications will have an additional HDTV camera crew on the exhibition floor during show hours for exhibitor booth demonstrations. <P>
Each day of the 2000 International CES, taped versions of the HDTV program, down-converted to play on conventional analog systems, will be available in selected Las Vegas area hotels, letter boxed, to retain the 16:9 aspect ratio of high-definition television. <P>
CES exhibitors who wish to advertise on either CES Today or CES webcasting should contact Gourvitz Communications at tel: 212 730 4807 or e-mail: gorvcominc@aol.com <P>
