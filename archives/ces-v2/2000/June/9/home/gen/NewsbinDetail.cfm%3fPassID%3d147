	<p>Arlington, VA - Feb, 25 2000
	<BR>
	The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced that it is changing the dates for the 2001 International CES to help exhibitors avoid overtime booth construction, decorating and drayage expenses.  The show will now run Saturday, January 6 through Tuesday, January 9, 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <P>
Previously, CES was scheduled to run Sunday, January 7 through Wednesday, January 10, 2001, forcing exhibitors to incur additional costs by having builders and decorators work on the weekend.  Total weekend overtime charges were estimated as high as $2.6 million. <P>
"Our exhibitors continue to make their exhibits more elaborate and have requested additional time to set up their booths," said Karen Chupka, CEA vice president of events and conferences.  "Many exhibitors can't start setting up their booths before January 1.  If we moved the show to our normal Thursday start date, the 2001 CES would open on January 4th.  By starting on Saturday the 6th, we allow our exhibitors two additional days to set up their booths, while still lowering their overtime costs." <P>
While CES has begun on a Thursday the past few years, setting Thursday as the opening day has not always been the case during the 34-year history of CES.  When the show first began in 1967, it opened on a Monday.  Then in the 1970s, CES moved to weekend opening days and then floated between Sunday and Saturday as opening days for most of the 70's and 80's and even into the early 1990's.  Throughout that time, CES attendance has continued to grow, reaching a record-setting 126,818 at the 2000 International CES.   <P>
CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing and connecting the industries that define the digital age.  CEA represents more than 600 U.S. companies involved in the development, manufacturing and distribution of audio, video, mobile electronics, communications, information technology, multimedia and accessory products, as well as related services, that are sold through consumer channels.  Combined, these companies account for more than $60 billion in annual sales. <P>
CEA also sponsors and manages the International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology.  All profits from CES are reinvested into industry services, including technical training and education, industry promotion, engineering standards development, market research and legislative advocacy. <P>
