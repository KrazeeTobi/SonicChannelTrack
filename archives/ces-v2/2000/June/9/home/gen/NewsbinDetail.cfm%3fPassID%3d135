	<font size="-1"><b>Anderson, McCollough and Roberts Share Insights On Internet Business and the Future of Consumer Electronics Retailing</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, Nev. - Jan, 8 2000
	<BR>
	For the very first time, the presidents of America’s leading consumer electronics retailers today shared a stage and their insights about the future at the 2000 International CES—Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle TechnologySM.  On a power panel moderated by Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) President and CEO Gary Shapiro, Brad Anderson of Best Buy, Alan McCollough of Circuit City and Leonard Roberts of Tandy Corp. discussed the impact of the Internet on consumer electronics retailing and gave optimistic predictions for the years ahead. <P>
When asked about the impact of the Internet on their businesses, each panelist expressed enthusiasm for their online ventures while stressing the advantages of having a “brick-and-mortar” business.  “The folks who choose to have a brick-and-mortar business and an online presence will be the winners,” said McCollough, citing the benefits of a decentralized distribution system and existing infrastructure.  Roberts talked of Tandy’s plans to leverage their brick-and-mortar brand and presence while adding to their reach with their online business. Anderson reiterated Best Buy’s enthusiasm about the Net on the heels of announcing its comprehensive Internet plans earlier this week.   <P>
Looking forward five years, the panelists ventured predictions about the percentage of the business that will be done online.  Tandy is “bullish” about their Internet business and expects it to represent 50 percent of its business by 2005.  Best Buy predictions were more modest at 15 percent.   <P>
Holiday rewards were all digital for the retail industry and enthusiasm is high for the digital future.  Ten percent of Best Buy’s December sales were digital products, and digital products “moved off the shelves at a great pace” at Circuit City, bringing the collective sales of these major retailers to about $25 billion in 1999.  When asked to make predictions for 2000, Brad Anderson gave a “guess” of $29 or $30 billion.  Though the other panelists wouldn’t venture a specific prediction, they were unanimous in their optimism for an explosive future. <P>
On the issue of Internet taxation, the panelists were again unanimous in their opposition to making the Internet a tax-free zone, saying it offered an unfair advantage to online only retailers and the higher-income Internet consumer.      <P>
When asked about the challenges that lie ahead for the industry, panelists cited the importance of staff training and retention.  Providing clarity to the consumer in an age of explosive growth with nonstop product innovation also is a top priority for all three retailers.   <P>
