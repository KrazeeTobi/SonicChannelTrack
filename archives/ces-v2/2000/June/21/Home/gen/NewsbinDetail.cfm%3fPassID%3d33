	<font size="-1"><b>Six Nationally Recognized Certification Exams Offered at The 2000 International CES</b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Oct, 11 1999
	<BR>
	Organizations representing various facets of the electronics industry are uniting to offer an unprecedented collection of professional electronics certification exams during the first ever "Certification Headquarters."  The program, hosted by the 2000 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, in Las Vegas, Nev., January 6-9, 2000, is the largest collection of such exams ever offered during a single event. <P>
"Certification is central to the vitality of individuals, employers and educational institutions of the electronics community, and CES is proud to host the certification efforts of six nationally recognized programs," explained Robbi Lycett, CES vice president. <P>
In the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association's (CEMA) continuing efforts to ensure professionalism in the workplace, the CEA (Certified Electronics Associate) exam will be the cornerstone of the computer-delivered examinations.  As the sponsor, producer and manager of CES, CEMA also has invited several other electronics associations to participate in delivering a wide range of professional certifications that will include: <P>
* CEA<br> * Electronic Technicians Association (ETA) <br> * International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET) <br> * Mobile Electronics Certified Professional (MECP) Program <br> * National Association of Radio and Television Engineers (NARTE) <br> * National Electronics Service Dealers Association (NESDA) <br> <P>
The exams will be held during show hours at the Sands Expo/Venetian. <P>
To prepare for the CEA exam, an official CEA Study Guide is available that covers all key content areas of the test.  The study guide includes thousands of illustrations, more than 400 questions and answers to reinforce the student's learning, and an interactive CD-ROM of Electronics Workbench.  To order the study guide, call 703 907 7670. <P>
