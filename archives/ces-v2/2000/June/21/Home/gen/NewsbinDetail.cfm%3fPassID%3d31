	<font size="-1"><b>Internet and Broadcast Audio Featured Throughout CES</b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Oct, 6 1999
	<BR>
	Digital continues to revolutionize the audio market, and the latest developments in audio will be at the 2000 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, in Las Vegas, Nev., January 6-9, 2000, throughout CES exhibits, pavilions, keynote addresses and conference sessions. <P>
"The stunning impact of MP3 and other audio downloading technologies, multichannel music formats like DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD, and the launch of digital audio radio (DAR) services in the U.S., makes audio one of the most compelling technologies featured at the 2000 International CES," explained Robbi Lycett, CES vice president.  "The Internet, digital recording, DAR and multichannel sound technologies are bringing new waves of digital audio products to market by adding to and developing the new sound quality first realized by the compact disc.  With a strong focus on these emerging technologies, plus the latest in specialty audio, home audio and mobile audio products, attendees throughout the CES show floor will enjoy a wide variety of cutting-edge audio technologies."  <P>
Featuring solid state technology, flash memory and the ability to download and store high fidelity music, the first portable MP3 devices are making a noticeable impact in the consumer technology marketplace.  Visitors to Digital Hollywood and the Digital Living Room Pavilion will see this dynamic new technology and how it is reshaping the way audio entertainment is distributed and heard. <P>
Another key audio technology highlighted at the show, DAR will reach a major milestone three weeks before the 2000 International CES when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is slated to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding a terrestrial DAR transmission standard.  With consumers buying other digital-based products at record adoption rates, DAR service providers are aiming for U.S. implementation in 2000. <P>
In addition, CES will feature leading Internet audio pioneer, Rob Glaser, chairman and CEO, RealNetworks Inc., to deliver the Technology Keynote Address on Friday, January 7, 8:30am in the Las Vegas Hilton Theater. <P>
<b>Conference Sessions</b> <P>
Several tracks of conference sessions, including Digital Hollywood, E-Commerce, Lifestyle Technology, Mobile Electronics/Wireless Communications, and Specialty Audio, will have specific sessions dedicated to audio technologies.  Attendees will explore the various types and forms of audio technology and discuss how this content will be distributed and delivered, in the home and on the road. Some of this year's audio sessions include: <P>
* Downloading Music on the Internet; MP3, MS Audio, A2B and Other Killer Technologies<br> * Digital Radio - Is it Ready for Prime Time?<br> * Digital Entertainment Convergence - A Content and Technology Explosion of TV, Music and the Internet<br> * Selling Entertainment as well as Consumer Electronics on The Web<br> * Breaking the Traditional Retail Mold: How to Sell Specialized Audio Successfully Online<br> * Increasing Awareness and Consumer Interest in High Quality Multichannel Sound <br> * E-Commerce for Media Companies and their Enterprise Partners<br> * Digital Music - From the Internet to the Home<br> * The Music Industry - Narrowband and Broadband Strategies<br> * Update on Digital Piracy and Copyright Infringement<br> * Home A/V Networking - An Update<br> * Audio Meets the Internet - Friend or Foe<br> * Digital Audio Recording<br> * DVD Audio - Multichannel and Beyond<br> * Targeting the New Audio Customer<br> * Net Audio Players: The Chip Industry's View<br> * Video Games Meet Home Audio/Video<br> * How Will Downloadable Digital Audio Music Affect the Specialized Audio Industry?<br> * Everyone Loves Music. So Why Don't They Love Specialty Audio?<br> * In an Age of Cultural Diversity, How Can the Specialized Audio Industry Market its Products More Successfully?<br> <P>
"The wide variety of conference sessions that are dedicated to audio is indicative of the $8 billion a year impact this media realizes in the consumer technology industry," said Lycett.  "Audio is the soul of a home entertainment system, and is increasing in strength as a primary form of consumer entertainment." <P>
<b>Exhibit Areas</b> <P>
Audio exhibits will be located in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) for home and portable audio products, the North Hall of the LVCC for Internet audio products, the Sands Expo for mobile audio products and the DAR Pavilion, and the Alexis Park Resort for specialty audio products.  A wide variety of companies representing all facets of audio will be exhibiting at the show, including: <P>
* Casio<br> * CD Radio<br> * Creative Labs<br> * Diamond Audio<br> * Harman<br> * I-Jam Multimedia<br> * Kenwood<br> * Lucent Technologies<br> * Panasonic<br> * Philips<br> * RealNetworks<br> * Samsung<br> * Sharp<br> * Sony<br> * Thomson<br> * USADR<br> * XM Satellite<br> <P>
 "With the increasing impact of Internet download technologies, DAR and digital recording, it is clear that this year's group of audio offerings at the 2000 International CES are more diversified than ever," added Lycett, "This strong showing at International CES indicates a very good year for the audio industry in 2000." <P>
The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), sponsor, producer and manager of CES, is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.    CEMA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  The 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
