	<p>Arlington, VA - Nov, 1 1999
	<BR>
	Early registrants for the 2000 International CES - Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, in Las Vegas, January 6-9, 2000 are receiving unusual rewards for their timely registration - trips to Paris, France and the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  In addition, ten registrants have won digital cameras, another ten will be awarded personal digital assistants (PDAs) on November 17th, and another ten will win MP3 players on December 17th. <P>
The first grand prize was awarded to Marc Hoffman, president and CEO of Pro-Sat Inc. in Atlanta. Hoffman and a guest will enjoy free airfare and five nights at a first-class Parisian hotel. The Paris Hotel grand prize will be awarded November 17th to another CES registrant. <P>
"Early registration makes for a better trade show experience for all parties, streamlining badge dissemination and allowing for effective logistical and show-traffic management," said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president. "CES is like no other trade show on earth, and we believe that the excellence of our show should be extended to registrants who help us create a better International CES experience."  <P>
In addition to being considered for the Paris Hotel grand prize, one of 10 PDAs and one of 10 MP3 players, registrants receive a free Exhibits Plus Pass that includes exhibit admission, keynote addresses and access to more than 70 conference sessions.  Early-bird discount rates for three fee-based CES conference tracks-Habitech, Retail Management and Digital Hollywood-are also available. The on-site registration fee for the Exhibits Plus Pass is $75. <P>
All prize winners must attend CES to claim their prize. They will be instructed to stop by the CEA booth in the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) Grand Lobby during show hours with a picture ID to claim their prize. <P>
The International CES is the largest annual tradeshow for consumer technology. As the showcase for the who, what, where and why of the consumer technology industry, international visionaries in content media, delivery and hardware illustrate new business models and the latest consumer applications. <P>
 The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology.  <P>
