	<font size="-1"><b>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman William Kennard addressed CES audience on remaining DTV copy protection and cable compatibility issues. </b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 7 2000
	<BR>
	The following statement was issued today by Consumer Electronics Association President and CEO Gary Shapiro in response to comments made today here at the 2000 International CES by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman William Kennard:   “The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) welcomes Chairman Kennard’s challenge to resolve the remaining copy protection and cable compatibility issues surrounding digital television (DTV).  We have aggressively developed and presented solutions to these important issues over the past several years.  As was clear in the Chairman’s speech, our industry and the Commission have the same ‘pro-consumer’ goals.  We welcome the FCC’s efforts to bring these issues to resolution.  We also look forward to a renewed commitment by the cable and content industries to remove the final remaining barriers to full cable compatibility and copy protection. “The fact is, digital television is thriving.  Our industry met our projections; DTV product sales since introduction will reach 120,000 units by the end of 1999.  All over the exhibit floor of the 2000 International CES, new digital television products are being presented in a broad variety of options.  Resolution of the cable compatibility and copy protection isues will only further spur this growing market.”   CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing. CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.  As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support. As the first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology. <P>
