	<font size="-1"><b>3Com's Benhamou to Present Opening Keynote</b></font>

	<p>Arlington, VA - Jul, 6 1999
	<BR>
	The International CES announced that Eric A. Benhamou, chairman and chief executive officer of 3Com Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., will deliver the Opening Keynote address at its 2000 show.  The first major technology event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES-Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology will be held January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nev.  <P>
Following the growing workstyle trend as technology enables consumers to work when and where they want, 3Com's products allow individuals and organizations worldwide to stay more connected by communicating and sharing information and resources at anytime, anywhere.  3Com Corp. is the largest single entity in the world dedicated to LAN- and WAN-based network infrastructures. With more than $5.4 billion in annual revenues, it is the second largest networking company in the world, delivering end-to-end connectivity solutions to consumers, small businesses, enterprises, and network service providers and carriers. Its installed base represents more than 300 million network connections worldwide, more than any other networking company.  <P>
Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), the sponsor, manager and producer of CES, said, "We are very pleased to have Eric Benhamou join us at CES.  3Com is a leading pioneer in creating new workstyle products, letting consumers work where they want and still stay connected to the office.  As networking crosses over from the office realm to the home environment, Benhamou's initiatives at 3Com, as well as in national programs, have marked key developments in the consumer technology industry."  <P>
In 1981, Benhamou co-founded Bridge Communications, an early networking pioneer, and was vice president of engineering of that company until its merger with 3Com in 1987.   Benhamou became the CEO of 3Com in 1990. <P>
In 1997, President Bill Clinton named Benhamou to the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, which advises the President on research and development focal points of federal programs to maintain U.S. leadership in advanced computing and communications technologies and their applications.  In 1992, he received the President's Environment and Conservation Challenge Award, the United States' highest environmental award.  <P>
Benhamou currently serves as chairman of the National Advisory Board for Western Governors University, a virtual university using advanced networking technologies to deliver technology-based distance-education. He also serves on the Board of Directors at Cypress Semiconductor and Legato.  <P>
From 1993 to 1997, Benhamou served on the Board of Directors of Smart Valley Inc., a non-profit consortium seeking to revitalize the Silicon Valley economy through advanced telecommunications and networking technologies. Benhamou chaired Smart Valley's telecommuting effort, responsible for the initiation of pilot projects at 3Com, Stanford University, Hewlett-Packard, Pacific Bell and Silicon Graphics.  <P>
Benhamou holds an honorary doctoral degree from Ben Gurion University of the Negev, a master of science degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Diplome d'Ingenieur from École Nationale Superieure des Arts et Mètiers, Paris. <P>
Benhamou will deliver his speech on Thursday, January 6, 2000, from 8:30-10:00 a.m. in the Las Vegas Hilton Theater.   <P>
CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.   <P>
CEMA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  The 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology.  <P>
