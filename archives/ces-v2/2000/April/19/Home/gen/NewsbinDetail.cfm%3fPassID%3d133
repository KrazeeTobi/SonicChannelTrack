	<font size="-1"><b>Privacy, Encryption and Internet Tax Top Internet 2000 Session</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, Nev. - Jan, 8 2000
	<BR>
	Yesterday during the Internet 2000 conference session held here at the 2000 International CES, an influential panel of industry leaders and government officials, shared the wisdom of their Internet experience with attendees.  As the showcase for the who, what, where and why of buying and selling, the 2000 International CES spotlights the foremost industry and government leaders involved in developing the online marketplace.  <P>
“The Net is changing our industry, and manufacturers and retailers need to understand the new e-commerce business models and regulatory issues,” said Robbi Lycett, CES vice president. “CES has always been a venue to learn about key industry issues.  The show offers numerous opportunities for executives to network and learn about e-commerce opportunities with our conference tracks, supersession, and exhibits.” <P>
John Chambers, president and CEO of Cisco Systems kicked off the Internet 2000 session and said the Internet has not only revolutionized productivity but also that the Internet and education are rapidly becoming the two equalizers in life. “The Internet has become the greatest change agent for politics, business, education and humanity,” he said.  “Changes that used to take decades now are happening at Internet speed, which is one to two years. If countries and companies don’t get it, they will be left behind. It is a matter of survival.” Chambers asked the audience, “Are you ready?” <P>
	CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro then introduced Virginia Governor James Gilmore who said that the information technology industry would be hurt if taxes are imposed on Internet commerce. He said, “We want everyone to have access to the Internet in the same way that they have access to telephones. America must not construct an Internet curtain." <P>
	Next to the podium was Bill Schrader, president, CEO and founder of PSINet. In a David Letterman style top ten list, he outlined the reasons why encryption and privacy are essential to the growth of the Internet, concluding with the fact that any product that is not secure will not gain market acceptance. He then detailed the top ten reasons why the Internet should not be taxed.  No. 1 reason he said was that 40 million registered voters might oust politicians that vote for an Internet tax. He said, “The Internet tax situation is the single biggest worry for PSINet.” <P>
	Microsoft’s Senior Vice President of E-Commerce Brad Chase said, “The promise of the Internet age is so great, and the possibilities are enormous.” However, he detailed three problems that confront Internet users: safe and private surfing, protection of kids online and the proliferation of spam. He said, “We want to make the Web indispensable and relevant to consumers and ensure that personal data remains private.” <P>
	Virginia Congressman Tom Bliley also spoke against “choking the Internet with taxation.”  He said, “Privacy is a huge concern. People don’t want their information bandied about. We need to find an intelligent solution. I recommend that you urge your representatives to go slow in enacting laws in this area.” <P>
 	FCC Commissioner Susan Ness was the final panel speaker. She said, “There has been a seismic increase in the demand for the World Wide Web…There is tremendous pressure for more spectrum. It is an increasingly difficult task to find more spectrum and we need your help to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity.” She mentioned software, sharing techniques and minimizing interference as possible solutions.  Shapiro concluded the session stating, “The Internet has created a truly networked global economy.” For more news on CES during and after the show, return to www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES news and information. <P>
CEA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 76-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all the facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEA represent more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels. <P>
 As the sponsor, manager and producer of the International CES – Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle TechnologySM, CEA reinvests all profits from CES into industry services, including technical training and education, product promotion, engineering standards development, market research, and governmental and legal affairs support.  As the first major technology event of the new millenium, the 2000 International CES is the launch pad for 21st century technology.  <P>
