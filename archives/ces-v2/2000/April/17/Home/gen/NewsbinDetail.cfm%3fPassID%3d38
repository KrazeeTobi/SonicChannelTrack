	<p>Arlington, VA - Oct, 18 1999
	<BR>
	The International CES announced Joseph P. Clayton, vice chairman of the board, Global Crossing, will speak at the CES Executive Briefing Luncheon at its 2000 show.  As the first major event of the new millennium, the 2000 International CES -- Your Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology will be held January 6-9, in Las Vegas, Nev. <P>
Familiar as an enthusiastic participant for 24 years in the world of consumer electronics with RCA and Thomson Consumer Electronics, Joe Clayton recently made his mark in the world of telecommunications as president and CEO of Frontier Communications.   Frontier recently merged with Global Crossing, creating a new global communications company.  With this unique perspective, Clayton will discuss the opportunities he sees for both telecommunications and consumer electronics participants in the global, digital market.   <P>
Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), the sponsor, manager and producer of CES, said, "Joe has proven that if you can make it in the consumer electronics industry you can make it anywhere!  Joe was not only admired at RCA, but retailers and competitors alike have great warmth and respect for Joe.  He was a great industry leader and chair of our association and he is sure to have some interesting thoughts on the future of telecom and consumer electronics." <P>
Clayton assumed a leadership position at Global Crossing when he was appointed vice chairman of the board on September 28 this year.  Global Crossing owns and operates a state-of-the-art fiber optic network in the United States and is developing and operating the world's first truly global IP-based fiber optic network with 88,100 announced route miles, connecting five continents, 24 countries and 170 cities. The Global Crossing Network and its product offerings will be available to more than 80 percent of the world's international communications traffic. Through its subsidiary Global Marine, Global Crossing also owns the largest fleet of cable laying and maintenance vessels in the world and currently services more than a third of the world's undersea cable miles.  <P>
As former executive vice president, marketing and sales for the Americas, Thomson Consumer Electronics, Clayton had been responsible for sales and distribution of RCA, GE and ProScan brand consumer electronics products throughout North and South America, including the successful introduction of the RCA Digital Satellite System (DSS) receiver in 1994.  Clayton also was the chairman of CEMA from 1995-1996.  Last month Clayton was named a board member of consumer electronics retailer The Good Guys. <P>
The CES Executive Briefing Luncheon will be held at 12:00pm on Sunday, January 9, 2000 in the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) Room #N250. <P>
CEMA is a sector of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), the 75-year-old Arlington, Virginia-based trade organization representing all facets of electronics manufacturing.  CEMA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels.  <P>
