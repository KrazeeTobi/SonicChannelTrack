	<font size="-1"><b>Eric Benhamou, chairman and CEO of 3Com, Gary Shapiro, CEA Chairman and President, and Darrell Issa, CEA Chairman deliver opening speeches on visions of a dynamic, networked future.</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, NV - Jan, 6 1999
	<BR>
	The 2000 International CES – Your  Source for Workstyle and Lifestyle Technology today honored the industry’s  past, and presented a vision of a dynamic networked future in speeches at  the show’s opening keynote session. Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the  Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), CEA Chairman Darrell Issa and Eric  Benhamou, chairman and CEO of 3Com, addressed a capacity crowd during the  morning session. Shapiro said this year’s International CES, the world’s largest annual  technology tradeshow, is honoring “50 people who can truly be called the  pioneers of the consumer electronics industry.” 	The 50 inductees into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame “paved the way  for today’s workstyle and lifestyle products,”  Shapiro said.  “The consumer  electronics industry has evolved from a hardware business to a consumer  technology industry that combines hardware, content and services.”  Digital  technologies are the “driving force” in the change, he added. 	Shapiro said sales of digital products totaled $30 billion in 1999 and are  expected to reach $38 billion this year.  DVD, home satellite, DTV and  digital audio all enjoyed consumer acceptance. “In the next five years,” he predicted, “our newly focused industry will  generate more products in more configurations and combinations than in the  entire history of the consumer electronics business.” Issa agreed, and praised the industry for “a record-setting year in bringing  new products at affordable prices to market.” Benhamou said current and planned consumer electronics products would enable  people to lead “more connected lives,” and added that connectivity in the  home was the “next frontier.” Benhamou said the connected home would use wireless networks for internal  interconnectivity, and broadband channels to link with the outside world.   He demonstrated video conferencing, wireless connections and new models of  Internet-enabled telephones. The multitude of networked products, he concluded, will “bring improvements  in the quality of lives.” Benhamou is one of four industry visionaries to present CES keynote  addresses.  Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates gave the New Millennium  Keynote last night.  Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems  will present the Executive Perspective Keynote today at 4:00, and Rob  Glaser, chairman and CEO of RealNetworks Inc., will deliver the Technology  Keynote tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. Special CES sessions include presentations by Joseph Clayton, vice chairman  of Global Crossing, Federal Communications Commission Chairman William E.  Kennard, and Virginia Governor James Gilmore.  CES also will offer more than  130 conference sessions on the newest trends, strategies and profit  opportunities in the consumer electronics industry. To showcase the products that will enable the connected world that Benhamou  described, CES features a full range of workstyle and lifestyle  technologies.  Included on the show floor are home networking, integrated  home systems, computers and information technology, telecommunications,  digital products, content providers and e-commerce offerings. “As Eric Benhamou explained, interconnection will come from the harmonious  deployment of many technologies,” Shapiro said.  “CES is the only show that  brings all of those technologies together.” For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit  www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.

CEA represents more than 500 U.S. manufacturers  of audio, video, accessories, mobile electronics, communication, information  technology and multimedia products that are sold through consumer channels. <P>
