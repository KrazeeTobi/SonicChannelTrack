	<font size="-1"><b>Gates Uses Humor to Demo Convergence Through Software-Connected Devices</b></font>

	<p>Las Vegas, Nev. - Jan, 6 2000
	<BR>
	Last evening at the 2000 International  CES, Microsoft Corp. Chairman and CEO Bill Gates demonstrated a new  interconnected era where “software magic” links and controls dozens of  digital consumer electronic appliances, enabling them to seamlessly share  information anywhere, anytime.  Gates predicted that in the future consumers  will have personalized access to music, news, entertainment, home management  services, e-mail and even wireless e-books, newspapers and magazines, inside  and outside the home from various Internet appliances, including TVs,  telephones , car stereos and pocket PCs. <P>
CES attendees can begin to see this convergence enabled by digital  technology on the show floor.  More than 1,500 exhibitors are showcasing the  latest in workstyle and lifestyle technologies here at CES to more than  90,000 industry professionals. <P>
To illustrate the pervasiveness of the digital age, Gates showed an amusing  video entitled, Everybody’s Talking about Technology.  It featured Gates in  a cameo performance as Austin Gates, International Man of Technology; a  spoof on MTV’s The Real World with Diane Sawyer, Tom Brokaw, Jeff Bezos and  Michael Dell; a court scene with Judge Judy settling a dispute between  elderly delinquents Gates and Warren Buffett; and actor Leslie Nielsen  speaking candidly about HDD, a.k.a. hard drive dysfunction. <P>
Microsoft’s mission to empower people through software will allow consumers  to engage in such interactive applications as participating in a game show,  organizing TV programs and music into customized collections, requesting  complimentary information from the Internet and creating and editing home  videos that can be stored on a Web page. <P>
In addition, a short video showed how the home of the future with universal  plug-and-play capabilities might operate.  Microsoft’s concept home in  Redmond, Wash. uses iris scanning to unlock the front door; panels  throughout the house to control the temperature, shades and the  entertainment center with music, Internet and TV access; and even a display  to show who is at the front door.  Gates said, “I actually live in a home  like this and it really works.”  He added, “It is more than just devices and  software; there are services that update the software. “The bottom line is straightforward, there will be a whole new generation of  products and we look forward to new partnerships,” Gates commented.  “The  next five years are going to be incredible.” <P>
