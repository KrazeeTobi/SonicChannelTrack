		Since I was born, I have felt music inside of me, because my father was a musician. At the age of 8 I built my first guitar amplifier, helped by an audio engineer, my first satisfaction was that this amplifier sounds.

Since that time my life has been rounded by audio and video technology. I grew up playing my guitar in different kind of music groups and dedicated to the professional audio. After that I have been working on the audio business, first in the home systems, then in car audio and security systems.

I was the fist one bringing the car audio's technology to Mexico, it was great success for me and all the people that came after me. My work in that time has focused on the car audio
because of the market's demand, but lately the development of new products and technologies have guided me to open my action field to other applications like the home theatre and mobile video.

Many years ago I realized that that here in Mexico there did not exist a publication about audio, video, high end audio and technologies for the Mexican consumers. I decided to start with a very good friend Lic. Juan Marquez the project of STEREOMANIA Magazine, a publication dedicated to promote new technologies and innovations between the consumers here in Mexico.

With more than 30 years in this business and more than 25 years attending to CES have bring with me the experience to keep going with technology day by day. I know the CES is my strongest tool to go ahead.

		Simon Yan is the founder and principal of BlueMap Design, a New York based design studio specializing in consumer products and structural packaging. Born in Hong Kong, Yan is hugely influenced by the way things are constructed. His interest in art and design gave him the idea that products are design objects that are part of a lifestyle. Initially interested in graphic design, he soon realized that he was far more excited by form and function. He switched from graphic design to product design at Pratt Institute. After graduating from Pratt with a degree in industrial design he found himself working with several top ranked design studios before starting his own practice in 2001. Unlike a lot of designers, who work on the aesthetics first and don't know much about the technical side of things. Yan's, design is a two-part process: first comes the idea for an object, which can be summarized in a single image; then comes the technical underpinnings that make the idea both workable and worthwhile. His work is about simplifying the way product design communicates. Asking questions, finding the best way of doing something, and developing basic criteria is how it begins for him. Yan has won numerous awards including IDEA, G-Mark Good Design Award, Red Dot Award, iF Award, ID magazine ADR Award and Good Design Award. His work has been published in a variety of magazines including ID magazine, Innovation, Axis, BusinessWeek, Time Magazine, Art Direction, New York Magazine, Graphis, House Beautiful, Yahoo magazine, Metropolis, T3, Stuff, Wired and GQ.
