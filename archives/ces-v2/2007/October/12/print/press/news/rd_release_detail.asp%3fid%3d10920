<span class="section_title">2006 INTERNATIONAL CES ROCKS LAS VEGAS WITH HOT NEW TECHNOLOGY, COOL PRODUCTS AND FAMOUS FACES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Record-Breaking Show Opened with 1.6 Million Net Square Feet of Exhibit Space, 2,500 Exhibitors and Industry Leading Speakers  </span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/6/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES&#174) opened yesterday amid a sea of the latest and greatest consumer technology gadgets, heavy hitting keynotes and informative conference sessions. With a record-breaking 1.6 million net square feet of space and 2,500 exhibitors, the 2006 International CES is the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow and runs through January 8. 
<p>       
	On Thursday morning, Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of CES, delivered an inspiring and exciting State of the Industry Address. Shapiro discussed the breadth of the current CE market, with the average U.S. home owning approximately 25 consumer electronics products.  Shapiro also talked about this year's International CES stating, "It is a Mecca, a vision for a better world, a world that only technology can provide."  
<p>
	U.S. Senator John Ensign (R-NV), called the "digital senator" by Shapiro, welcomed the packed audience to his home district.  Ensign emphasized his desire to work to prevent unintended consequences from federal legislation.  He also called on the attendees to become involved in Washington, D.C. politics and help inform policy makers what they should and should not be doing.  
<p>
	Following Shapiro's State of the Industry address, Sir Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO of Sony Corp., kicked off the show with a visionary opening keynote address. Stringer focused on the necessary, yet often-difficult relationship between technology and content.  He addressed ways in which Sony is working to allow consumers to have choice in when, where, how and in what format they want their content.  Stringer outlined Sony's four pillars that allow the company to "Entertain the Future."  
<p>
	The four pillars include E-Entertainment, Digital Cinema, High-er Definition and Playstation. Stringer demonstrated his empire of movies, music, television programming, gaming and electronics with the help of top executives like Kaz Hirai and Michael Dell and artists like Tom Hanks, Dan Brown, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer.  
<p>
      Stringer concluded: "Content and technology are strange bedfellows, but we are joined together. Sometimes we misunderstand each other, but isn't that, after all, the very definition of marriage?"
<p>      
      Thursday's second keynote featured Intel CEO Paul Otellini. "Welcome to the New Normal," Otellini said as he kicked off his presentation. "The New Normal is not a place; it is a state of being," he continued, "and the test of good technology is that once you use it, you can't go back." Otellini then introduced two new Intel technologies as part of the New Normal of today - the Intel Core Duo Processor and Intel Viiv.   He explained that the Intel Centrino Duo laptop, featuring the Core Duo, is 68 percent faster, consumes 28 percent less power and contains better Wi-Fi functionality.  The Core Duo Processor is the first new premium brand since the Pentium Processor and the one millionth Core Duo will ship in three weeks whereas it took one year for the Pentium to achieve the same milestone. Dell Chairman of the Board Michael Dell joined Otellini on stage to demonstrate two Dell laptops that use the Core Duo. Other industry executives on state for the Intel Viiv debut included DirecTV President and CEO Chase Cary and AOL Chairman and CEO Jonathan Miller.
<p>      
      The keynote concluded with a star-studded update on the ClickStar announcement Intel made at the 2004 International CES.  Hollywood's Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Danny DeVito, Lori McCreary, Brad Silberling and Tom Shadyac praised the ability to have artist-created channels and on-demand movies at home that are still in theaters.  Silberling announced the first ClickStar online film, "10 Items or Less," starring Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. 
<p>      
      Also on Thursday, two CES Industry Insider presentations gave attendees an intimate look into visionary minds of two industry leading executives, Ivan Seidenberg, CEO of Verizon Communications and Michael Dell, founder and chairman of Dell Inc.
<p>      
      Seidenberg spoke in detail on his company's advanced fiber network and how it is bringing the power of convergence to customers. Seidenberg said Verizon was committed to coverage, speed, quality and security to digital customers. He also spoke of how his company is bringing the digital lifestyle to customers through a myriad of multimedia products and applications, such as V CAST Music, a new service announced today that will transform the way consumers enjoy music.  V CAST Music allows Verizon Wireless customers the ability to download music over the air directly to their wireless phones or straight to their personal computers.
<p>      
      "Our product line is hotter than ever and 2006 will be the best year ever.  The PC still reigns supreme as the product of choice," said Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Inc. in his Industry Insider presentation. To that end, along with partner Jen-Hsun Huang, nVidia president and CEO, Dell introduced the XPS 600 Renegade, a system build expressly for gaming and "extreme high definition graphics." Additionally, Dell made clear his desire to extend his company's leadership in flat panel displays to the televisions market.  "LCD and flat panel televisions are a natural extension," said Dell.  Dell also highlighed and demonstrated Dell's new customer service tool Dell Tech Connect that offers both product and software support, as well as elaborated upon Dell's environmental stewardship in the area of electronics recycling. 
<p>      The 2006 International CES SuperSession series kicked off on Thursday with a look at the future with "Emerging Technologies: A View From the Lab."  Moderated by Suzanne Kirschner, senior technology editor of Popular Science, panelists discussed the designs with which engineers are tinkering and examined current trends to prognosticate the future of consumer electronics.  Panelists included:  Don Carkner, vice president of product planning, iFire Technology Corporation; Mark Cook, DFIS, Eastman Kodak Company; Michael Howse, president and CEO, PacketHop; Janice Marconi, president, Marconi Works International, Daniel McGahn, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, Konarka Technologies, Incorporated; Chris Thomas, Director of Strategic Initiatives, Intel; and David Vieau, president and CEO, A123 Systems. 
<p>      Also on Thursday was the "Entertainment Technology: View from Hollywood" panel session moderated by Chris Marlowe of the Hollywood Reporter.  Marlowe led a discussion about the past, present and future of digital content distribution, which featured the thoughts of industry leaders Bill Chapman, vice president of creative development and emerging technologies for Turner Studios; Michael Arrieta, senior vice president of Sony Pictures Digital Sales and Marketing; Curt Marvis, co-founder and CEO of CinemaNOW; and Jim Bankoff, executive vice president of AOL.  Marvis declared 2006 is the year studio content holders begin to open up to the possibilities technology can provide consumers.  Arrieta said industry has been claiming "this is the year" for several years and offered that content already has opened up, but that going forward the goal should simply be trying to keep honest people honest by offering legitimate business models for digital distribution.  "Digital distribution is an evolution, not a revolution," he said. 
<p>      The VoIP or Not to VoIP SuperSession panelists debated simplifying the technology, integration of advanced applications, what consumers really wanted and what the next stage is for voice over IP.  The panel discussed how VoIP is challenging the telecome and cable providers and affecting their future in this emerging technology.  The panel was moderated by Jim Penhune, director, Broadband Media & Communications Research, Strategy Analytics.  The panel was made up of industry experts, including Jeff Citron, co-founder, chairman and CEO, Vonage; Brad Garlinghouse, vice president, Communications Product, Yahoo! Inc.; David Hofstatter, co-founder, president and CEO, CallWave, Inc.; Kevin Keene, vice president of voice and data solutions, Motorola Connected Home Solutions; Bryan Martin, president and CEO, 8x8, Inc.; John Muleta, partner, Venable LLP; and Robert Simkavitz, president and CEO, FreelineUSA, Inc. 
      
<p>      A consumer-focused session, "The Battle for Control of the Connected Consumer" delved into the world of the connected consumer and examined the role that the hardware, software, content and service provider industries play in serving the always-on consumer. Moderated by Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, panelists included Rudy Provoost, CEO, Consumer Electronics, Philips; Dr. Levy Gerzberg, president and CEO, Zoran Corp; Satjiv Chahil, senior vice president, personal systems group, HP; Michael Gronsi, vice president of business development, HELIO and Kal Patel, executive vice president, strategy and international, Best Buy.  Panelists noted that connectivity is the common denominator of convergence and it is what will continue to drive industry growth in the future. They warned that industries serving the connected consumer must find new business models and join together to form new partnerships in order to find mutually beneficial co-existence, even as they compete for customers. All agreed that the 2006 International CES is a milestone in terms of industry and product convergence.

<p>      At Thursday's final Super Session, "CNET's The Next Big Thing" top level executives from Linksys, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba, CNET editors and CNET users discussed the next big thing in technology trends for 2006. CNET predicts that mobile or handheld content, next generation DVD formats and home entertainment hubs will be the next big thing for 2006. An interesting twist to the session was the immediate polling of the audience to gauge their feelings to the three emerging trends. Wireless polling devices were given to the audience and they were asked three questions for each new trend. Results were immediately aggregated backstage and shared. Audience participants felt that the biggest barrier to the adaptation of handheld devices is the availability of content. An overwhelming number of audience members felt that Blu-ray would win the next generation DVD format war. Audience members also felt that difficult set up of home networks was preventing consumers from adopting them.
