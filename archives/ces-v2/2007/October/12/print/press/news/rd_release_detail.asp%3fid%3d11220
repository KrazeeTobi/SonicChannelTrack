<span class="section_title">CEA FORECASTS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS REVENUE WILL SURPASS $155 BILLION IN 2007</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Year-End 2006 Revenue at $145 Billion</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/6/2007</i></strong>
<br><br>
Factory-to-dealer sales of consumer electronics are projected to 

exceed $155 billion in 2007, or seven percent growth, according to the semi-annual industry forecast released today 

by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA<sup>&#174</sup>).  The forecast comes on the eve of the 2007 

International CES<sup>&#174</sup>, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow.
<p>
      "The consumer electronics (CE) industry has outdone itself once again, with revenues totaling $145 billion in 

2006, and we're on track for another year of healthy growth," said CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro. "We surpassed 

original projections for the second year in a row, and the industry outlook is proof positive that Americans can't 

do without their beloved consumer electronics.  Consumers are benefiting from our industry's innovations and only 

want to see more of them.  I am excited to be witnessing this innovation first-hand on the show floor at the 

International CES."
<p>
      Todd Thibodeaux, CEA's senior vice president of industry relations, acknowledged 2006 industry growth far 

exceeded CEA's conservative forecast at the beginning of the year.  "We originally forecast eight percent growth, 

but when all was said and done, we saw an impressive 13 percent growth for the year.  Consumers started the year 

investing in innovative consumer electronics products and seemingly never stopped.  With the 2007 forecast, we see 

the consumer love affair with technology continuing at a healthy clip."  
<p>
      Thibodeaux said the display category will continue to fuel industry growth in 2007.  "The TV market is setting 

all-time revenue records.  CRT-based sets are giving way to flat panel displays. The successful ongoing transition 

to digital television is driving demand in this market space."
<p>
      CEA projects that display technologies will continue to be the star category in the industry and account for 

$26 billion in revenues for 2007.   All television sets manufactured today with an analog tuner must also contain a 

digital tuner, which is largely responsible for the vast increase in digital television sales. Unprecedented price 

declines in plasma and LCD displays are also contributing to growth.  For 2007, these flat panel displays are 

expected to ship a combined 19 million units.
<p>
      Next-generation consoles will make the video game market one to watch in 2007.  An analysis of year-end game 

console sales reports for 2006 indicates that holiday sales will lift revenues in 2007 to $16 billion, a 23 percent 

increase. 
<p>
      MP3 players continue to drive the audio market. CEA projects that MP3 players will account for 90 percent of 

the $6 billion in revenues for the portable entertainment market. Thirty-four million MP3 players shipped in 2006 

and an additional 41 million are expected to ship in 2007. 
<p>
      "One of the biggest drivers of both the audio and portable entertainment markets is the MP3 player. It 

continues to ship at large volumes and 2007 will be no different as the market shifts into a replacement mode.  For 

example, many consumers will be replacing their first generation players with new players offering video playback 

capability," said Thibodeaux.
<p>
      Driving the mobile electronics market are portable navigation and GPS devices, evidence that consumers are 

continually looking for products that will keep them safe and make their automotive travel easier. Two million units 

shipped in 2006, a 66 percent increase over 2005, and 2007 shipment volumes will continue to propel the market with 

three million units projected to be shipped, generating $1 billion in revenues. 
<p>
      Other product categories that will see substantial growth in 2007 are PCs, accessories and digital imaging 

devices.  In 2006, shipment volumes of laptops eclipsed their desktop counterparts. CE accessory sales also will 

grow in 2007, to the tune of $11 billion, in large part due to an overall consumer emphasis on portability. Total 

digital imaging shipments are expected to exceed 32 million units, with revenues projected to reach $8 billion, 

making 2006 and 2007 the best revenue years for this category.
