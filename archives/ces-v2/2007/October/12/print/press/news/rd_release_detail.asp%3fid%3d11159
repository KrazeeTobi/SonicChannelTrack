<span class="section_title">2007 INTERNATIONAL CES EXPANDS TO SANDS/VENETIAN FOR ALL NEW LINEUP OF MUST-SEE EVENTS</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Keynotes, High-Performance Audio and Home Theater, Innovations Plus, TechZones, CES Unveiled and Press Conferences among Venue Highlights</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;10/17/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
CES keynotes, high-performance audio and home theater exhibitors, 

Innovations honorees, emerging technology exhibits, TechZones, and a range of special media events take center stage 

at the newest venue of the 2007 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES<sup>&#174</sup>) - Innovations Plus at 

the Sands. To accommodate these must-see events, CES is augmenting the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) with halls 

B, C and D of the Sands Expo and Convention Center and portions of the adjoining Venetian Hotel. The 2007 

International CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology tradeshow, runs January 8-11, in Las Vegas, 

Nevada.  
<p>
       This year, keynotes will move from their previous location at the Las Vegas Hilton to the more spacious 

Palazzo Ballroom at the Sands/Venetian. The star-studded lineup of CE industry leaders will feature Bill Gates, 

chairman, Microsoft; Ed Zander, chairman and CEO, Motorola Inc.; Robert Iger, president and CEO, The Walt Disney 

Co.; and Michael Dell, chairman, Dell Inc. 
<p>
       In addition, more than 200 high-performance audio and home theater (HPAHT) exhibitors, including, MBL of 

America, Musical Surroundings, Sumiko and Thiel will exhibit at the Sands/Venetian. 
<p>
       "For the second year in a row, the Sands is a must-visit venue at the International CES, and we're expecting 

equal or greater popularity with the addition of The Venetian to our venue lineup," said Karen Chupka, senior vice 

president of events and conferences at CEA, the producer of the CES. "CES will continue to showcase the latest 

emerging technologies, award honorees and expert speakers and will build on this success by offering an even more 

powerful lineup of exhibitors, events and speakers at the Sands/Venetian." 
<p>
       The Sands/Venetian will again be home to Innovations Plus, which will feature more than 12 emerging 

technology related TechZones, the International CES Innovations Honorees displays, a dozen conference sessions, 

select CES Partner Programs, and live radio broadcasts from Dave Graveline's "Into Tomorrow" program.
<p>
       Innovations Plus at the Sands/Venetian will feature the largest concentration of market-specific TechZones at 

the 2007 International CES. The Anytime-Anywhere TechArena, sponsored by Sling Media, includes content-specific 

areas such as The Download and the IPTV TechZone. Also, the Consumer Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) TechZone 

and other emerging technology-focused TechZones such as Consumer Robotics and Studio@Home each have dedicated 

exhibit area for the hottest companies and products in these respective markets. Other innovative TechZones at 

Innovations Plus include Bluetooth, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA), ExpressCard, and Mobile and Personal 

Broadband.
<p>
       Returning to the Sands/Venetian this year is the Innovations 2007 Design and Engineering Award honoree 

display, which showcases the best-designed and engineered products of the year. New this year, attendees can use 

touch screen voting kiosks to vote for the Innovations People's Choice award, representing CES attendees' favorite 

Innovations honoree product. The Innovations showcase also features a stage for live presentations and product 

demonstrations from honorees. 
<p>
       CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES takes place 4-7  p.m. Saturday, January 6 in 

the Marco Polo Ballroom of the Sands/Venetian. Credentialed CES press get a sneak peek of the hottest 2007 product 

debuts, while checking out the Innovations Design and Engineering Honorees showcase and networking with 80 leading 

technology companies at the only on-site, pre-CES press preview.
<p>
       With all the action taking place at the Sands/Venetian, CES has taken measures to ensure all CES attendees 

have an opportunity to visit the Sands/Venetian each day of the show.  In addition to opening at 8 a.m., an hour 

earlier than the other venues, two separate shuttle loops will run continuously during show hours to the venue - one 

between the Sands/Venetian and the Las Vegas Convention Center and one between the Sands/Venetian and all official 

CES hotels.
<p>
       For credentialed press attending the exhibitor press conferences on CES Press Day, Sunday, January 7, 

shuttles will run from 8 a.m. - 6 p.m. every 30 minutes between the LVCC South Hall 1, Paradise Road entrance and 

the Sands Expo Bus Loading Area. 
<p>
       Credentialed CES press also will find a full-service press room in the lower level lobby at the 

Sands/Venetian in room 105. Amenities include press registration, CES bag pick-up, computers, fax machines and 

phones, high-speed Internet, exhibitor press kits and box lunches (with press lunch coupon) 11:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. 

Monday through Thursday or while they last.
