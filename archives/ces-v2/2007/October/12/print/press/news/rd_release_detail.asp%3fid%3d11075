<span class="section_title">2007 INTERNATIONAL CES ANNOUNCES TOP-NOTCH LINEUP OF KEYNOTE SPEAKERS</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Microsoft's Gates, Motorola's Zander and Disney's Iger Slated for Keynote Addresses</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;7/10/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA<sup>&#174</sup>) announced today 

that top executives from Microsoft, Disney and Motorola will deliver keynote addresses at the 2007 International 

Consumer Electronics Show (CES<sup>&#174</sup>), reinforcing the International CES as the global event at the 

intersection of technology and content. The 2007 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology 

tradeshow, will be held in Las Vegas, January 8-11, 2007 and will celebrate the show's 40th anniversary.
<p>
Bill Gates, chairman and chief software designer of Microsoft Corp., will return to CES for his ninth pre-show 

keynote address on Sunday, January 7, 2007, at 6:30 p.m. Ed Zander, chairman of the board and CEO of Motorola Inc., 

will kick off the 2007 International CES with an opening keynote, immediately following a State of the Industry 

Address by Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, which starts at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, January 8. Robert Iger, 

president and CEO of The Walt Disney Co., will round off day one of the International CES with his company's first 

CES keynote address at 4:30 p.m., Monday afternoon. All keynotes for the 2007 show will take place at The Venetian's 

Palazzo Ballroom.  
<p>
"What an amazing and unprecedented lineup to kick off the 2007 International CES.  Bill Gates, Ed Zander and Bob 

Iger are industry greats who will electrify the audience at the 2007 International CES in a very informative and 

entertaining way," said Shapiro. "These three industry visionaries will present their views of where the industry - 

particularly digital content and entertainment - is heading from their unique positions as heads of some of the 

world's most influential companies."
<p>
Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft has continually advanced and improved software technology. With the full 

attention of the consumer technology world, Gates has previously used the International CES to preview products and 

technology on the horizon for consumers.  Microsoft's previous product debuts at CES include consumer technologies 

such as the Xbox, Tablet PC and eBook.
<p>
Ed Zander became chairman of the board and CEO of Motorola Inc. in January 2004.  Since then, Zander has 

successfully reorganized Motorola, overseen the introduction of several exciting new products and sharpened 

Motorola's focus on innovation and operational efficiency.  He joined Motorola with more than 25 years of experience 

in the technology industry, including serving as the managing director of Silver Lake Partners and the president and 

COO of Sun Microsystems.  
<p>
Motorola exhibited in the first CES in 1967 and has participated in the show throughout CES's 40 year history.
<p>
Robert Iger was named president and CEO of The Walt Disney Company in March 2005 and has served on Disney's board of 

directors since 2000.  In his previous role as president and COO of The Walt Disney Company, Iger helped oversee all 

aspects of the company's worldwide operations including its filmed entertainment, theme parks and resorts, media 

networks and consumer products businesses.  He began his career at ABC in 1974 and held a series of senior 

management positions there.  During Mr. Iger's tenure as Disney CEO, Disney became the first company to offer 

television shows for download on Apple's iTunes Music Store, and, furthering its strategy of delivering outstanding 

creative content, acquired computer animation leader Pixar.    
<p>
The 2007 International CES will feature the hottest product debuts from 2,700 exhibitors, covering more than 30 

product areas, including the latest in wireless, digital imaging, mobile electronics, home networking and more. For
