<span class="section_title">INDEPENDENT AUDIT RESULTS REVEAL MOST SUCCESSFUL INTERNATIONAL CES IN HISTORY</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Attendance Tops 150,000; Successful Expansion to the Sands Increases Square Footage to a Record 1.69 Million Net Square Feet</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;5/4/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES&#174) drew a record crowd of 152,203 industry professionals, with more than 25,000 international attendees, during its four-day run in Las Vegas January 5-8, 2006. The attendance numbers, verified by an independent audit from VERIS Consulting, confirm the International CES as the world's largest tradeshow for consumer technology.
<p>      
      "The audit results prove that 2006 was the year that the International CES transformed from an industry tradeshow to a major global event," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CES&#174), the producer of CES. "In addition to the 'who's who' of the technology industry, the 2006 show also attracted top government officials, Hollywood stars, entertainment industry executives, engineers, retail buyers and media from all over the world."
<p>      
      The 2006 International CES was the largest CES in history in terms of both attendance and square footage. Attendance in 2006 increased 4.3 percent over the 2005 mark of 145,868. With the addition of the Sands Expo and Convention Center, 2,700 CES exhibitors showcased their wares over a record 1.69 million net square feet of space.
 <p>     
      International attendance at the 2006 International CES reached an all time high of 25,493 from 144 countries, up from 23,000 attendees from 115 countries in 2005, an increase of 5.4 percent. A total of 60 formal delegations from across the globe also attended CES in 2006, including 28 first-time delegations from countries such as Bulgaria, Denmark, Nigeria and Sweden.
<p>      
      "The audit verifies that attendance at the International CES continues to increase among our targeted categories," said Karen Chupka, senior vice president of events and conferences, CEA. "We were thrilled to see that a significant amount of new attendees in 2006 came from outside the United States."
<p>      
      Leading companies in the audio, accessories, broadcasting, cable, content, digital imaging, electronic gaming, emerging technology, home networking, home theater, mobile electronics, video and wireless industries continue to utilize CES as the launch pad for new technologies, with 79 percent of the Fortune 100 companies attending CES in 2006.
<p>      
      Similarly, a large number of senior executives and final decision makers from across all industries continue to strike business deals at CES. According to the VERIS report, 42 percent of all 2006 International CES attendees were senior-level executives, with more than 16,000 being a president, CEO or business owner. Additionally, more than one third of CES attendees are the final decision makers on new product buys and partnerships.
<p>      
      The audit disclosed that CES continues to attract business leaders from all areas, including the influential education, engineering, entertainment, retail and venture capital industries. This year 6,849 engineers, 18,650 retail buyers and 3,180 venture capitalists and business developers flocked to CES, along with more than 8,500 attendees from the content, broadcast, film and software development/publishing industries. Together, the number of content development and film industry attendees more than doubled over 2005 numbers.
<p>      
      The International CES also brings together the largest concentration of government officials outside of Washington, D.C., with more than 120 federal, state and international government representatives present in 2006. Policymakers from the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and representatives from the French, German and Japanese governments were on hand to participate in several public policy conference sessions. 
<p>      
      Influential analysts and media attend the show each year to see the latest and greatest trends. More than 4,500 media and 2,200 financial and market analysts attended in 2006. Of that, 944 were international journalists representing 52 different countries, up six percent from 2005.
 <p>      
      VERIS Consulting audited CES' tradeshow attendance records, verifying the 2006 International CES registration procedures and record keeping systems. A VERIS Consulting tradeshow audit provides verification of exhibition records, including direct on-site observation, examination of registration systems and testing of attendee records. Total attendance counts are verified, as well as records and record-keeping systems. Post-show analysis includes direct confirmation sampling, reconciliation of attendance lists, elimination of duplicate names and verification of demographic data with source of documentation.
<p>      
      Leading the tradeshow industry, VERIS began independent audits for the International CES in 1997. Often, final audit numbers can differ from estimates given on-site due to additional badge pick-ups and badge reader reports.  This audit complies with the industry standards for audits adopted by the International Association of Exhibition Management in August 2004.  In addition, CEA is a member of the Exhibition and Events Industry Audit Council, which is responsible for determining standard guidelines for conducting trade show audits.
<p>      
      With more than 1.4 million square feet of exhibit space already sold, the 2007 International CES will be held Monday, January 8 through Thursday, January 11, in Las Vegas, Nevada.
