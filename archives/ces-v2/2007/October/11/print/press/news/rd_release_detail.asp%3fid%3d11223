<span class="section_title">CEA LAUNCHES CONSUMER EDUCATION INITIATIVE AND SETS THE RECORD STRAIGHT REGARDING CE ENERGY CONSUMPTION</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">EPA, Verdant Magazine Co-Sponsor Environmental Awareness Day at 2007 International CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/10/2007</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2007 International CES<sup>&#174</sup> Environmental Awareness Day 

was the largest in show history.  With a focus on the key industry issues of consumer education, electronics 

recycling and energy efficiency of electronics, Green Wednesday featured the launch of <a 

href="http://www.myGreenElectronics.org">myGreenElectronics.org</a> - a resource guide from the Consumer Electronics 

Association (CEA<sup>&#174</sup>) - as well as a preview of a landmark study on the energy consumption of consumer 

electronics (CE) products. 
<p> 
The day began with a kick-off event sponsored by CEA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and <i>Verdant</i> 

magazine.  Attendees heard from environmental policy leaders who shared a glimpse of the new <a 

href="http://www.myGreenElectronics.org">myGreenElectronics.org</a> and data regarding recycling resources.  

Additionally, table top displays from the event's corporate and non-profit partners included Computer Recycling for 

Education, Dell, Ecosol Solar Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Jimi Products, NEC, Panasonic, Sharp and Xantrex 

Technologies. 
<p>
"Consumers are clearly in dire need of clear, up-to-date information regarding electronics recycling," said CEA 

Economist Shawn DuBravac, who led the morning's presentations with the results of a consumer recycling survey.  The 

survey indicated that consumers are largely unaware of their electronics recycling options, with 76 percent of 

consumers reporting they did not have knowledge of their local recycling programs. Of this group, 71 percent said 

they were likely to recycle if they knew of a program in their area. 
<p>	
"Consumers would recycle their electronics if only they knew where, when and how," said DuBravac. "While most 

consumers say they would seek information from the obvious sources such as the newspaper, television, the radio and 

the Internet, the majority of consumers say they would look for signs in electronics stores." 
<p>
Parker Brugge, CEA's senior director and environmental counsel, previewed CEA's contribution to the effort to 

educate consumers, <a href="http://www.myGreenElectronics.org">myGreenElectronics.org</a>. "CEA seeks to empower 

electronics consumers about responsible use, reuse and recycling of electronics with this initiative. <a 

href="http://www.myGreenElectronics.org">myGreenElectronics.org</a> is intended to be a "one stop" consumer resource 

for electronics recycling, information about electronics' energy consumption and eco-friendly purchasing 

opportunities," Brugge said.
<p>
Featured guest speaker, Scott Sherman, associate assistant administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency 

Response, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), next highlighted the success of the EPA's Plug-in to 

E-cycling program.  Mr. Sherman presented awards to the program's corporate partners-Best Buy, Cingular, Dell, eBay, 

Hewlett-Packard, Intel, JVC, NEC, Philips, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, and Staples, who together recycled more 

than 34 million pounds of electronics in 2006. Dell and Hewlett-Packard received special recognition for their 

efforts.  
<p>
"Electronics are made from valuable resources and use energy. As consumers, this presents us with a tremendous 

opportunity to positively impact the environment with our individual decisions. With our everyday choices-what we 

buy to how we use it and what we do with it when we're finished using it-we can make a difference," said Sherman. 
<p>
The afternoon featured three environmentally-focused panel sessions: "Federal and State Policy Developments in 

Electronics Recycling," "Saving Energy with Electronics," and "State Recycling Requirements for Consumer Electronics 

Manufacturers and Retailers."   The "Saving Energy with Electronics" session featured the results of a landmark 

study commissioned by CEA on the role of consumer electronics in household electricity and energy consumption.  The 

full study will be released next week on CEA's website, <a href="http://www.CE.org/energy">www.CE.org/energy</a>.
<p>
