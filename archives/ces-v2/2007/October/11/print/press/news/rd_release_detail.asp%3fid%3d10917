<span class="section_title">WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY TRADESHOW DAZZLES LAS VEGAS WITH LATEST CONSUMER ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY </span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">2006 International CES Breaks Record with 1.6 Million Net Square Feet; Expands to Sands Expo and Convention Center to Showcase Emerging Technologies</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/5/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES&#174), the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, opens its doors today with 2,500 exhibitors showcasing the latest products and services in audio, digital imaging, electronic gaming, emerging technology, home entertainment, home networking, mobile electronics and wireless technology.  Produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA&#174), the International CES runs today through January 8, 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada.
<p>      
      "With 1.6 million net square feet of space and 2,500 exhibitors, it's a record-breaking year for CES," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences at CEA. "The 2006 International CES features keynotes and presentations from some of the industry's most influential leaders, educational sessions on the hottest industry issues, attendees from all facets of consumer technology, and, of course, the latest and greatest products and technologies."
<p>       
      The 2006 International CES focuses on 30 product categories spread throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), the Sands Expo and Convention Center, the Alexis Park and the Las Vegas Hilton.  Some exhibitors taking space at the 2006 show include: Audiovox, Canon, Casio, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Epson, Fuji, Google, HP, Intel, LG, Logitech, Microsoft, Panasonic, Philips, Pioneer, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Texas Instruments, Thomson, Toshiba, XM Satellite Radio and Yahoo.
<p>      
      "Adding to the excitement this year, we have expanded to Innovations Plus at the Sands Expo and Convention Center to create a home for new and emerging technologies," added Chupka.
<p>      
      Innovations Plus at the Sands is a hub of 500 emerging technology exhibitors, 150 international exhibitors, 75 conference sessions, more than 12 TechZones, the Innovations 2006 Design and Engineering Award honorees, the CES Industry Insider series and CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of CES.  Innovations Plus at the Sands opens early each day at 8 a.m. and also features special events and conference sessions such as Flash Forward 3.0, EE Times' Great Minds, Great Ideas, pulvermedia's Consumer VoIP Summit, Roboticstrends, the Scientific American Innovations People's Choice Awards and Ziff Davis' Last Gadget Standing SuperSession.
<p>      
	Innovations Plus at the Sands also houses another new destination, The Download.  Featuring companies such as RealNetworks, Wherever Media, audiocandy.com, TotalVid and Puretracks.com, The Download showcases the latest technologies and applications for the legal downloading of digital content.
<p>      
      More new ideas at the International CES can be found in the CES Central Plaza.  The CES Concierge Center is a one-stop-shop where attendees can ask show questions, find exhibitor booths, grab a bite to eat, check e-mail, find multilingual interpreters, make restaurant reservations, watch live feeds of CES keynotes and a variety of other services. The Concierge Center also features destinations such as AOL's Cyber Pavilion, the Concierge Bar by Freescale, Intel's Digital Spa, Movielink's Digital Living Room, navigation stations from Tele Atlas and the Vonage Phone Booth.  The NextGen Home Experience and the Mobile Electronics Certified Professionals (MECP) Installer Training also will be based in the CES Central Plaza.
<p>      
      The 2006 International CES features 199 conference sessions and 350 expert speakers. Top industry leaders from Microsoft, Sony, Intel, Yahoo!, Google, Dell, Kodak and Verizon will deliver keynote speeches and Industry Insider presentations.  Additionally, a retail power panel featuring executives from Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA and Radio Shack, and a one-on-one session with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin and CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro also will take place at the Sands.
<p>      
      Throughout the show floor, 20 TechZones will showcase cutting-edge technologies in concentrated, market-specific areas.  Hot TechZones in 2006 include Bluetooth, Cardio Play, pulvermedia's Consumer VoIP, Digital Car, EE Times' Great Minds, Great Ideas Zone, IPTV, Robotics, Studio@Home, USB and Zigbee Alliance.
<p>      
      While the show continues to grow, CES continues to work to strike the proper balance between show growth and providing a quality experience for attendees and exhibitors.
<p>      
      To help attendees navigate the show floor all CES maps and on-site directional signage feature icons and color blocks to direct attendees to various product categories and exhibit areas. Additionally, MyCES kiosks will be placed strategically throughout the show floor to help attendees find exhibitors, print personalized show maps and create links to people they want to meet.
<p>      
      Navigation between the CES venues and around Las Vegas is also a priority for CES.  To help ensure attendees can make their way easily to the Sands, CES established two new shuttle bus routes - the Sands hotel shuttle between each official CES hotel and the Sands and the Sands Express between the Sands and the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Alexis Park Express, the LVCC shuttle loop, the LVCC hotel shuttles, the LVCC golf cart interconnect between the South and Central halls, the Las Vegas Monorail and the taxi link program also provide easy transportation to the show and around Las Vegas.
<p>      
      With 130,000 attendees from 110 countries attending the International CES, the 2006 International CES offers global guests services such as assistance with translated materials and keynotes, interpreters and access to International Commerce Centers that provide computers, phones, fax machines and private meeting rooms.  Also, International Gateway exhibitor delegations from countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore and Denmark return to CES displaying cutting-edge products from abroad at the Las Vegas Hilton and the Sands.
<p>      
      The 2006 International CES features two full-service press rooms, one on the Sands show floor and one in the LVCC, room S229.  Press rooms include computers, Internet access, phones, fax machines, press kits, keynote transcripts, photos and snacks, and are available to credentialed CES press and analysts only.
