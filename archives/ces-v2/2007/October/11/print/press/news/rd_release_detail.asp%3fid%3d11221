<span class="section_title">NEW CONVERGENCE OF CE PRODUCTS WITH CONTENT AND DYNAMIC KEYNOTE ADDRESSES HIGHLIGHT DAY ONE OF THE 2007 INTERNATIONAL CES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Motorola, Disney, Nokia and Pipelines Executives Launch 40th Anniversary of CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/9/2007</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2007 International CES<sup>&#174</sup> opened its doors 

yesterday to the largest display of cutting-edge products in consumer technology, powerful industry keynote 

addresses and trend-setting conference sessions. With a record-setting 1.8 million net square feet of space and 

2,700 exhibitors, the 2007 International CES, the world's largest technology tradeshow runs through January 11 and 

celebrates the show's 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary.
<p>
        Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, the producer of the International CES, kicked off the 2007 show 

Monday morning with his "State of the Industry Address." He spoke about the "new convergence" taking place in the CE 

industry and forecast that the CE industry will soar to $155 billion in 2007. Shapiro cautioned against putting 

limits on innovation and technology and urged attendees to support Digital Freedom, a grassroots coalition designed 

to protect the rights of artists, consumers and innovators to use digital technology and lawfully required content. 

Shapiro highlighted the coalition's presence at CES, in the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) lobby, and on the web 

at <a href="http://digitalfreedom.org">digitalfreedom.org</a>.
<p>
        Directly following Shapiro's address, Ed Zander, president and CEO of Motorola, delivered the opening day 

keynote. The theme was seamless mobility using the Internet as Zander rode onstage on a bike that can power a cell 

phone. Zander stated that people around the world are getting connected with 25 million mobile phones sold each 

second. To do its part, Motorola is focusing on connecting the unconnected in emerging markets with its inexpensive 

Motofone.  
<p>
        "Everything is becoming digital and everything with a digital heartbeat will get connected," he said. The 

company is focusing on cool mobile devices and creating cool experiences for users, enterprise mobility and the home 

to go. Zander announced new partnerships and performed ground-breaking demonstrations with Yahoo!, called Y! Go, 

Kodak, the Razr Z6 and the "Moto Follow Me TV" that sends live video streams to a mobile handset through an IP 

set-top box. Zander said, "It truly is the Internet in your pocket," and concluded, "The home is the hub of seamless 

mobility." 
<p>        
        Monday's second keynote featured Robert Iger, president and CEO of the Walt Disney Company. With a "Monday 

Night Keynote" theme, Iger explained how Disney's tremendous success has come from the timelessness of great 

characters and storylines, along with cutting-edge technologies. Iger stated that no company currently delivers more 

content in more ways to more people than the Walt Disney Company, and introduced several friends to help demonstrate 

the wealth of content Disney currently produces and distributes. 
<p>
        First, from the ABC network, stars from the award winning series "LOST," Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly, 

talked about the multi-platform experience now providing fans more interaction with the program. Mike Tirico, lead 

announcer of "Monday Night Football" joined Iger on stage to explain the demand from ESPN fans to be plugged into 

instant information and live coverage from anywhere and at anytime. Currently, fans in 102 countries can watch ESPN 

live.  
<p>
        Iger's biggest announcements of the evening included the launch of the redesigned, interactive and "extreme 

digital" Disney.com website and the confirmation of "Pirates of the Caribbean III, At the World's End." Jerry 

Bruckheimer, renowned Hollywood producer, joined Iger on stage to show a teaser for Pirates III and announced that 

Keith Richards will be making a cameo in the film. Iger concluded with his promise to continue to provide 

cutting-edge creative content for innovative new CE products.        
<p>        
        Monday also launched the CES Industry Insider Series with an address from Nokia president and CEO, 

Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, and a Pipelines Power Panel focused on the various platforms for delivery of content.
<p>        
        Kallasvuo's presentation focused on mobility, Internet, communities and convenience. He stated that Nokia's 

newest products would provide great features and richer experiences, particularly in the new models of digital 

cameras and wireless phones, the latter of which will include real-time navigation and search capabilities.
<p>        
        The Pipelines Power Panel, moderated by CEA's Shapiro, debated the state of content delivery and the 

importance of HDTV to both the stakeholders and their consumers. The panel featured heavy hitters from leading 

broadcast, cable, satellite and telecommunications companies including Chase Carey, president and CEO, DIRECTV, 

Inc.; Charles W. Ergen, chairman and CEO, Echostar Communications Corporation; Virginia Ruesterholz, president, 

Verizon Telecom; Glenn A. Britt, president and CEO, Time Warner Cable; David J. Barrett, president and CEO, 

Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc. and Patrick J. Esser, president, Cox Communications, Inc. The Pipelines panelists 

discussed competitive differentiators and services that cut across multiple delivery platforms.  
<p>        
        Also on Monday, CES celebrated its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary with a bash on the ESPN/CEA Stage in the LVCC 

Grand Lobby. Gary Shapiro was joined on stage by Jack Wayman, the "Father of CES," along with Rossi Ralenkotter, 

president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and Dan Cole, CEA's vice president of Business 

Development, to honor the four decades of the International CES and the 2007 exhibitors that also exhibited at the 

first show in 1967. 
<p>
        The extensive lineup of CES conference sessions launched on Monday with the first International CES 

SuperSession of 2007, "Understanding Consumer Digital Ecosystems" which focused on convergence and interoperability. 

SuperSession panelists included Tim Bajarin, president, Creative Strategies Inc.; Satjiv Chahil, senior vice 

president, Global Marketing, HP; Dr. Levy Gerzberg, president and CEO, Zoran Corporation; David Jaworski, CEO, Pass 

Along Networks; Eric Kim, senior vice president and general manager, Digital Home Group , Intel; Frans van Houten, 

CEO, NXP Semiconductors. The panelists agreed that consumers are increasingly seeking devices that work together to 

create a digital ecosystem of CE products. Bajarin stated that the digital ecosystems of today include the cell 

phone, personal computer and TV and concluded that the future of these ecosystems would broaden to further devices, 

leaving no product a stand alone island.
<p>        
        In Monday's session, "Congress Talks Tech," Jon Healy, editorial writer for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, 

moderated a discussion among Congressmen Tom Davis (R-VA), Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Jon Porter (R-NV). The 

conversation opened with a welcome from Congressman Porter, Las Vegas' congressional representative, and focused on 

several key issues that will be addressed in the 107<sup>th</sup> Congress including Internet gaming, government and 

security, copyright and technology, patent reform, net neutrality and the travel ban.  Regarding the travel ban, 

Congressman Davis categorized it is "throwing the baby out with the bath water." All the panelists agreed the ban 

cuts off an important line of communication and understanding for members and their staff.  
<p>        
        The home health technology SuperSession, "The Future of Consumer Electronics: Convergence With Home Health," 

provided a sneak preview of the potential that consumer electronics could bring to the health care industry. Charles 

S. Golvin, principal analyst at Forrester Research, moderated a lively discussion on the future relationship between 

home heath care and consumer technology with panelists Doug Busch, CTO, Digital Health Group, Intel Corporation; 

Gary Feather, director, Digital AV Systems, Sharp Laboratories of America; William Lalinde, M.B.A., H.S.A., business 

manager, MOTOHEALTH, iDEN Sector, Global Mobile Devices Business, Motorola, Inc.; Jeff Perry, business manager, 

ConnectedCare - Motiva, Philips Consumer Healthcare Solutions and Dave Watson, CIO, Kaiser Permanente. The panelists 

discussed a growing transformation of the healthcare industry, stemming from consumer technology including powerful 

personal telemedicine tools, such as home-based, tele-monitoring products for patients.
<p>        
        A standing-room only crowd attended Monday's final SuperSession, "CNET's Next Big Thing," moderated by 

CNET.com, editor-at-large, Brian Cooley. Cooley was joined by CNET colleagues Tom Merritt and Molly Wood, as well as 

a consumer representative, Nate Lanxon, who won a CNET Backstage Crew trip to the International CES.  The session 

featured panel discussions, video presentations and audience polling surrounding three key themes: mobile video 

content, Internet downloaded or streamed content and digital rights management (DRM). 
<p>
        	Commercial video content, delivered to a variety of portable products such as mobile phones, MP3 

players and game players, was characterized as a disruptive technology as it is challenging established business 

models. An audience poll revealed that news clips and sports highlights would most intrigue consumers, but 

full-length TV programming and specialized content were suggested as adoption drivers by industry experts in a video 

presentation and panel discussion. 
<p>
    	Panelists agreed bandwidth limitations would hamper Internet downloading of content in the near-term, but 

disagreed as to whether or not it would ever completely replace physical media. Some argued consumers hold dear the 

collectible aspect of physical media while others suggested that it could become a specialty industry in a networked 

content world.  The audience was split with 44 percent saying DVD will give way to Internet video sooner than later 

and 56 percent disagreeing. 
<p>
   	Two additional panelists joined the stage for the final theme of digital rights management - CEA Senior Vice 

President of Government Affairs Michael Petricone and Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) Executive Vice 

President and Special Policy Advisor Fritz Attaway.  Arguing in favor of some sort of DRM technology going forward, 

Attaway said people "need to be reminded of the deal they made." Lanxon retorted that DRM is so easily undermined 

that it is ineffective, and seeing a friend hauled off to prison for illegally using content would be reminder 

enough to most consumers. He added he would be happy to pay twice as much for content if he were allowed to enjoy it 

on his CE products when, where and how he wanted. Petricone noted the industry is so concerned about onerous 

limitations on consumers and technology that it is significantly rallying around the new Digital Freedom campaign.
