<span class="section_title">GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER TO KEYNOTE AT THE 2006 INTERNATIONAL CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;11/15/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced today that Larry Page, co-founder 
and president of products of Google, will deliver a keynote address at the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  
<p>  
      Page's address is slated for Friday, January 6, 2006, at 4 p.m. in the Hilton Theater at the Las Vegas Hilton. The 2006 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, runs January 5-8 in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
<p>
      "Page has helped lead Google to become one of the world's most prolific brands and recognized as the world's largest Internet search engine. Google has been one of the most innovative companies of the past decade, moving beyond its search engine roots. With his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to innovation, Page is a natural fit for CES.  We are thrilled that he has come on board as a keynoter at the 2006 International CES," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA. "Page 
joins an outstanding keynote line-up that includes Microsoft's Bill Gates, Intel's Paul Otellini, Sony's Howard Stringer and 
Yahoo!'s Terry Semel".
<p>
       Larry Page co-founded Google as the CEO in 1998 and grew the company to more than 200 employees and profitability 
before moving into his role as president of products in April 2001. He continues to share responsibility for Google's 
day-to-day operations and serve on Google's Board of Directors.
<p>
      In 2002, Page was named a World Economic Forum Global Leader for Tomorrow. He is a member of the National Advisory 
Committee (NAC) of the University of Michigan College of Engineering, and together with co-founder Sergey Brin, he was 
honored with the Marconi Prize in 2004. He is a trustee on the board of the X PRIZE and was elected to the National Academy 
of Engineering in 2004.
<p>
      The 2006 International CES focuses on more than 30 product areas from more than 2,500 exhibitors spread throughout the 
Las Vegas Convention Center, the Sands Expo and Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton and the Alexis Park. For more news on
