<span class="section_title">CES AUDIT CONFIRMS LARGEST SHOW FLOOR AND INTERNATIONAL  ATTENDANCE IN CES HISTORY </span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">More Than 27,000 International Attendees  Cover a Record 1.8 Million Net Square Feet of Exhibit Space</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;6/6/2007</i></strong>
<br><br>
The International CES<sup>&#174</sup> announced 

today the results of an independent audit that confirms CES&rsquo; stature  as the world&rsquo;s largest consumer technology 

tradeshow and North   America&rsquo;s largest annual tradeshow of any kind.&nbsp; The 2007 International CES audit, conducted 

 by VERIS Consulting LLC, revealed that the industry tradeshow drew a record  27,020 international attendees, with overall 

attendance totaling 143,695  industry professionals during CES&rsquo; four-day run in Las Vegas, NV, January 8-11,  

2007.&nbsp; </p>
<p>VERIS  is certified by  The Exhibition and Event Industry Audit Commission to perform audits. The VERIS audit 

differentiates the  International CES from other industry tradeshows in that each attendee is  specifically tagged and 

counted only once and that CES only counts sold exhibit  space to calculate show size, versus other events that include comp, 

barter and  show usage space such as registration areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The audit results  prove that the International CES is the paramount location for industry  professionals from all 

around the globe to come together for unparalleled  business opportunities,&rdquo; said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of 

the Consumer  Electronics Association (CEA)<sup>&#174</sup>, the producer of CES. &ldquo;In addition to  attracting the best 

in the technology industry, the 2007 CES also drew top  professionals from the content, wireless and retail industries, as 

well as  government officials, venture capitalists, engineers and media from all over  the world.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The 2007 International CES was the largest  CES in history in terms of both international attendance and square footage.  

International attendees, representing 140 countries, reached an all-time high,  increasing by more than five percent over 

2006. A total of 48 formal  delegations attended CES in 2007, including six attending for the first time  from Australia, 

Dominican Republic, United   Arab Emirates, Germany,  Morocco and Peru. </p>
<p>With the addition of CES&rsquo; newest venue, the  Sands Expo and Convention Center/The Venetian, total exhibit space also 

reached  an all-time high. More than 2,700 exhibitors showcased their newest products in  a record breaking 1.8 million net 

square feet of space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having  the largest floor space in CES history allowed the International CES to display  and demonstrate the full 

range of CE technologies and related content and  services from major wireless, content, home theater and in-vehicle 

technology  companies, among many others,&rdquo; said Karen Chupka,  senior vice president of events and conferences, CEA. 

&ldquo;The audit confirms the  International CES is the must-attend event for all professionals in the  consumer technology 

industries and related fields to see the latest and greatest  products and trends, network and attend educational sessions 

all within four  action-packed days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  2007 International CES VERIS audit confirmed that the event was attended by 74  percent of Fortune 100 corporations, 

as standout companies in the audio,  accessories, broadcasting, cable, content, digital imaging, electronic gaming,  emerging 

technology, home networking, home theater, mobile electronics, video  and wireless industries continue to use CES as the 

launch pad for new  technologies.</p>
<p>A  significant number of decision makers and senior executives spanning all  industries do business at CES. The VERIS 

report found that 40 percent of all  attendees were senior level executives, with almost 14,000 being a president,  CEO or 

business owner. Similarly, more than one third of 2007 International CES  attendees are the final decision makers on new 

product buys and partnerships.</p>
<p>The  audit showed that CES continues to attract business leaders from all areas,  including the influential education, 

engineering, entertainment, retail and  venture capital industries. This year 6,761 engineers and developers, 20,358  retail 

buyers and 3,392 venture capitalists and business developers flocked to  CES, along with more than 10,000 attendees from the 

broadcast, film and  software development/publishing industries- a 15 percent increase over 2006.</p>
<p>The  International CES also brings together a large concentration of government  leaders, with more than 60 government 

officials in attendance including  policymakers from the United States House of Representatives,&nbsp; Department of 

Commerce, Office of the United  States Trade Representative, Department of State, Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) 

and Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Many participated in  public policy conference sessions.</p>
<p>Each  year, influential media and analysts attend the show to see the hottest new  products and trends in the consumer 

technology world. More than 4,500 media and  2,200 financial and market analysts attended in 2007. Of these, 1,228 were  

international journalists representing 73 different countries, up 28 percent  from 2006.</p>
<p>VERIS  Consulting audited CES&rsquo; tradeshow attendance records verifying the 2007  International CES registration 

procedures and record-keeping systems. A VERIS  Consulting tradeshow audit provides verification of exhibition records,  

including direct on-site observation, examination of registration systems and  testing of attendee records. Total attendance 

counts are verified, as well as  records and record-keeping systems. Post-show analysis includes direct  confirmation 

sampling, reconciliation of attendance lists, elimination of  duplicate names and verification of demographic data with the 

source of  documentation.</p>
<p>Leading  the tradeshow industry, VERIS began independent audits for the International  CES in 1997. Often, final audit 

numbers can differ from estimates given on-site  due to additional badge pick-ups and badge reader reports.&nbsp; This audit 

complies with the industry  standards for audits adopted by the International Association of Exhibition  Management in August 

2004. In addition,  CEA is a member of the Exhibition and Events Industry Audit Council, which is  responsible for 

determining standard guidelines for conducting trade show  audits.</p>
<p>With  more than 1.5 million square feet of exhibit space already sold, the 2008  International CES will be held Monday, 

January 7 through Thursday, January 10,  2008, in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
