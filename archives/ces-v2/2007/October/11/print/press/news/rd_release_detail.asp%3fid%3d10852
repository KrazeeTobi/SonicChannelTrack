<span class="section_title">INTERNATIONAL CES ANNOUNCES POWERHOUSE LINE-UP OF SPEAKERS FOR THE 2006 INDUSTRY INSIDER SERIES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Presenters Include Industry Leaders in Digital Imaging, Retail, Telecommunications and Government</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;10/19/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
The International Consumer Electronics Show (CES&#174) today announced the group of heavy hitters slated to present Industry Insider presentations. The 2006 International CES, produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA&#174), is the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow and runs January 5-8, 2006 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
<p>      
      This year's Industry Insider speakers include industry leaders Ivan Seidenberg, CEO, Verizon Communications; Kevin Martin, chairman, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Antonio M. Perez, president and CEO, Eastman Kodak Company.  The series also will feature a Retail Power Panel with Brad Anderson, vice chairman and CEO, Best Buy; David Edmondson, president and CEO, RadioShack; Alan McCollough, chairman and CEO, Circuit City and Larry Mondry, CEO, CompUSA.
<p>      
      "The CES Industry Insider program keeps getting bigger and better and the leaders involved in this year's program epitomize the energy and excitement of CES and the entire consumer technology industry," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA.  "Each of the speakers in this year's program will give CES attendees unprecedented insight into the state of the CE industry and its future."
<p>      
      Verizon's Seidenberg kicks off the Industry Insider presentations on Thursday, January 5, from 11 a.m. to noon.  Seidenberg was named CEO in 2002 and chairman of the board in January 2004.  Under his reign, Verizon has become one of the domineering forces in communications services, with more than $71 billion in annual revenue.  A veteran CES speaker, he gave an Industry Insider presentation at the 2004 International CES.
<p>      
      On Friday morning, Kodak's Antonio Perez will present his vision for the digital imaging industry from 11 a.m. to noon.  Perez has served as president of Kodak since 2003 and was elected CEO in May 2005.  No stranger to the digital imaging business, Perez spent 25 years at Hewlett-Packard and now leads Kodak's digital transformation aimed at strengthening the company's ability to compete in the fastest growing imaging of the imaging industry.
<p>       
      Following Perez's presentation, from 1 to 2 p.m., FCC Chairman Kevin Martin will sit down with Shapiro for a one-on-one discussion about the digital television transition, broadband, consumer home recording rights and other issues critical to the consumer electronics industry.  Martin was appointed chairman of the FCC in March 2005 and is a first-time presenter at CES.  
<p>      
      Wrapping up the Industry Insider Series on Friday afternoon, CES presents the Retail Power Panel from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m.  The Retail Power Panel, moderated by Shapiro, features the CEOs of retail giants Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA and RadioShack.  The session brings together the biggest names in the retail industry to discuss the hottest selling technologies and the future of the consumer electronics retail business.
<p>      
      New for the 2006 International CES, all Industry Insider presentations will take place at the Sands Expo and Convention Center in the Galileo room number 904.  The Sands also is home to the all new Innovations Plus, which houses emerging technology exhibitors and conference sessions, the Innovations 2006 Design and Engineering Awards honorees, hot product TechZones, CES partner programs, and an enhanced and expanded CES Unveiled.
<p>      
      For more information or to see a full line-up of speakers and conference sessions at the 2006 International CES, visit www.CESweb.org/attendees/conferences.
<p>
