<span class="section_title">2006 INTERNATIONAL CES ATTENDEES GET THE DOWNLOAD -- NEW CES TECHZONE TO SHOWCASE AUTHORIZED CONTENT SHARING TECHNOLOGIES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">National Music Publishers Association and RIAA Partner with CEA at Sands Convention Center to Promote Permitted Online Services</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;12/14/2005</i></strong>
<br><br>
The consumer technology and music industries come together to celebrate innovative and legal content sharing products and technologies at The Download - a new TechZone to be featured at the upcoming 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show (CESÂ®).  The International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, returns to Las Vegas, Nev., January 5-8, 2006.   
<p>      
      The Download, cosponsored by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEAÂ®), National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), is one of many new exciting technology showcases at Innovations Plus at the Sands, the newest CES venue located at the Sands Exhibition and Convention Center. The Download will feature the latest in content downloading technologies from Akimbo Systems (www.akimbo.com), Asoka USA Corp. (www.asokausa.com), audiocandy.com, BridgeCo. (www.bridgeco.com), iMesh (www.imesh.com), puretracks.com, RealNetworks (www.real.com), Samsung Telecommunications America (www.samsung.com/wireless), TotalVid Inc. (www.totalvid.com) and Wherever Media (www.wherever-media.com).
<p>
      "The controversy over unauthorized downloading services grabs the media headlines but the truth is many innovators are creating cool and legal new ways for consumers to access music, movies and other content online.  The Download will showcase leading services and technology innovators who are meeting consumer demand to access content 'anywhere and anytime' while respecting copyright concerns," said CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro. "We are particularly pleased that the NMPA and the RIAA are our partners in this CES TechZone.  While we may skirmish as we try to determine the balance between copyright, owner and consumer rights in the digital age, we all recognize that technology can lead to a profitable new world to develop new business opportunities and serve consumers in exciting new ways."  
<p>      
      "The RIAA is pleased to join with CEA to sponsor The Download," said RIAA Chairman and CEO Mitch Bainwol.  "Record companies have demonstrated a strong desire to work with a variety of legitimate online enterprises that respect the rights of creators and provide high-quality music to fans. As showcased in The Download, the technology is available, and others are already paving the way.  An online marketplace populated by legitimate downloading services allows our industry to invest in new music and serve our consumers."
<p>      
      "As music publishers, we seek to expand the audience for artists while protecting their work. We are happy to work with CEA, the International CES and RIAA to highlight services that are helping us reach this goal," said NMPA CEO David Israelite.
<p>      
      A recent study conducted by CEA, the producer of the International CES, found that only 16 percent of adults who access the Internet through a portable entertainment device subscribe to an authorized music downloading service that allows them to download content legally.  
<p>      
      "Our hope is that by showcasing authorized download services we can help educate consumers about their digital rights," concluded Shapiro. "We continue to believe that we can find ways to balance innovation and home recording rights with the legitimate concerns over protecting copyright."
<p>      
      The Download TechZone joins a variety of other CES TechZones located throughout the show floor.  More than 20 TechZones will showcase cutting-edge technologies in concentrated, market-specific areas.  Other hot TechZones in 2006 include Bluetooth, Cardio Play, pulvermedia's Consumer VoIP, Digital Car, EE Times' Great Minds, Great Ideas Zone, IPTV, Robotics, Studio@home, USB and Zigbee Alliance.
<p>      
      The 2006 International CES will feature more than 2,500 exhibitors showcasing the latest in consumer technologies over a record 1.6 million net square feet of exhibit space.  For more information, including online registration, updated CES news, events and schedules, visit www.CESweb.org.
