<span class="section_title">DTV TRANSITION  AND NEW CAR TECHNOLOGIES HIGHLIGHTED ON DAY THREE AT THE 2007 INTERNATIONAL CES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">FCC Chairman Martin and CEA's Shapiro Discuss DTV Transition and Broadband Technology; Hot Products Honored at Last Gadget Standing Supersession</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/11/2007</i></strong>
<br><br>
The digital television (DTV) transition, the growing 

relationship between the automotive and consumer electronics industries and electronics recycling were the hot 

topics on the third day of the 2007 International CES<sup>&#174</sup>. Produced by the Consumer Electronics 

Association (CEA<sup>&#174</sup>), the 2007 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, 

runs through today and celebrates its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary. 
<p>
        Wednesday's Industry Insider Series featured Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Kevin Martin, 

who joined CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro for a one-on-one conversation about the digital television transition, 

cable compatibility, net neutrality and other issues critical to the consumer electronics industry. Chairman Martin 

noted that the significant increase in broadband use has been one of the things he's been most proud of in his term. 
<p>
        "The goal is that everyone has access to broadband," said Martin. "It impacts the way that we get 

entertainment, seek healthcare and receive education. Trying to put in place a regulatory environment that allows 

operators to invest in broadband technology is critical for consumers to be able to take advantage of the 

technologies we see on the show floor."
<p>
        The morning SuperSession, "Connect2Car:  The Automobile's Convergence with Consumer Electronics," moderated 

by Chris Cook of AAMP of America, included a panel of leading experts from both the consumer electronics industry 

and the automotive industry. The panelists included Rich Chutorash, director electronics new product, Johnson 

Controls Inc.; Wieland Holfelder, vice president and chief technology officer, DaimlerChrysler Research, Engineering 

and Design North America Inc.; Keith Lehmann, senior vice president - Consumer Electronics, Kenwood USA Corporation; 

Timothy Nixon, manager, Advanced Technology Development, Ford Motor Company and Stephen Witt, vice president, Brand 

Marketing, Alpine Electronics.  
<p>
        The panels discussed several current roadblocks to better integration of cutting-edge CE products into 

personal vehicles. The roadblocks included the moving target of consumer demand, the issue of differing standards 

between CE and automobiles and the varying product cycles of the two industries. The panelist concluded by proposing 

ideas for better integration. The ideas ranged from the announcement of Ford's new "Sync" platform to an optical 

interface. Witt explained the next phase must focus on four key factors:  convergence of the car and home, driver 

convenience, ease of use and user content management. He concluded by stating, "Never before have the points of view 

of these two industries been as similar as they are today."  
<p>
        Jason Linnell, executive director, National Center for Electronics Recycling, moderated a panel discussion 

regarding the public's knowledge of, and participation in, electronics recycling. Other speakers at the "Federal and 

State Policy Developments in Electronics Recycling" panel included: Walter Alcorn, environmental consultant, Alcorn 

Consulting; Shawn DuBravac, economist, CEA; Jay Illingworth, vice president, Electronics Product Stewardship Canada; 

Verena Radulovic, Product Stewardship, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Solid Waste; and Peter 

Robertson, partner, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, LLP. 
<p>
  	DuBravac presented the results of a CEA consumer survey, which found that 76 percent of consumers are 

unaware of their local electronics recycling options. Of that 76 percent, 71 percent said they would recycle if they 

only knew where to do so. DuBravac referred attendees to CEA's new consumer website, myGreenElectronics.org, which 

will provide consumers with local e-waste recycling information, the latest environmental tips and an ever expanding 

searchable database of green products.
<p>
  	Panelists also discussed the state of e-cycling in the United States and recommended a national e-cycling 

initiative that would nationalize a uniform set of standards rather than create 50 different jurisdictions for 

handling e-waste. Alcorn presented data from the National Center for Electronics Recycling's (NCER) Patchwork Study, 

which found that the state patchwork of e-cycling regulations amount to $25 million in costs that would be avoided 

with a national program. Peter Robertson remarked that the timing for such a plan may be ideal because, "a 

Democratic Congress is simply more amenable to a national e-cycling initiative than a Republican one."
<p>        
        In Wednesday's standing-room only Last Gadget Standing SuperSession, 10 finalists competed head-to-head for 

product votes and laughs from the crowd. Hosts Robin Raskin, from "The Boomer" and advisors from Yahoo!Tech, 

moderated the session. Finalists included the V-Click cell phone from D-link, HP TouchSmart PC, RoboSapien's RS 

media robot, Nokia n95, Data Drive Thru's Tornado data port, Archosa Wireless Portable Media player with touch 

screen, a Salton coffee maker with weather information, Great Call Jitterbug, Pure Digital Point and Shoot Camcorder 

and Samsung Ultra Music Phone. 
<p>
        Each product was allotted a four minute demo and at the end, the audience voted online at <a 

href="http://tech.yahoo.com">tech.yahoo.com</a> and by applause. The online winner was the HP TouchSmart PC. The 

Data Drive Thru Tornado data port won the audience applause portion.
