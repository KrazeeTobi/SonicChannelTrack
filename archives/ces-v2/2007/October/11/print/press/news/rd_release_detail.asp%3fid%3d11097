<span class="section_title">2007 INTERNATIONAL CES TO HOST THE TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING EMMY AWARDS</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Awards Presentation On Monday, January 8 at CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;8/4/2006</i></strong>
<br><br>
The International Consumer Electronics Show (CES<sup>&#174</sup>) 

will host the Technology & Engineering Emmy<sup>&#174</sup> Awards for the first time next year, announced  Gary 

Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and Peter Price, president and CEO, 

National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.  The Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards will be CES's opening 

evening event on Monday, January 8, 2007.  The International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, 

will be held in Las Vegas, January 8-11, 2007 and will celebrate the show's 40th anniversary. 
<p>
	The Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards honor achievements in two areas: Science & Technology for 

Television, which includes broadcast, cable and satellite distribution, and secondly, Advance Media Technology 

encompassing interactive television, gaming technology, and for the first time, the Internet, cellphones, private 

networks, and personal media players.  In addition, for the first time, Emmy Awards will be presented for the best 

use of Advanced Media Technology by commercials as well as programmers.
<p>
	"As CES becomes a global cultural event featuring the best of technology and content, we are thrilled to 

partner with the Emmy Awards to announce at CES the best in science and technology for television," said Shapiro.  

"For the content, technology and engineering industries, CES is THE place to be this January.  We look forward to 

helping promote the world famous Emmy Awards at CES."
<p>
	"The International CES has long been the launch pad of entertainment technology," said Mr. Price, "so it is 

fitting that our Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards, which recognize achievement in both television engineering 

and advanced media technology be showcased there. With the National Television's Academy's new efforts this year to 

recognize television anytime anywhere with Emmy Awards for content and technology, this move is particularly 

fitting."  
<p>
	The National Television Academy is currently accepting entries for the Advanced Media Technology Emmy Awards 

in nine categories.  In order to be eligible, the production must occur May 1, 2005-April 30, 2006; the entry 

deadline is September 22, 2006.   Advanced Media Technology entries will be judged by panels of industry 

professionals in New York in Fall 2006.  Entry guidelines and forms are available at <a 

href="http://www.emmyonline.tv">www.emmyonline.tv</a>.  
<p>
	Among the keynote speakers for the 2007 International CES will be Bill Gates, chairman and chief software 

designer of Microsoft Corp; Ed Zander, chairman of the board and CEO of Motorola Inc., and Robert Iger, president 

and CEO of The Walt Disney Co.  CES will also feature the hottest product debuts from 2,700 exhibitors, covering
