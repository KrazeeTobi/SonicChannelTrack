<span class="section_title">CONNECTED CONSUMER EXPERIENCE AND CONTENT PARTNERSHIPS HOT TOPICS FOR DAY TWO AT THE 2007 INTERNATIONAL CES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Dell and CBS Keynotes and Cisco Industry Insider Focus on the Future of Consumer Technology</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/10/2007</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 

connected  consumer experience and partnerships in the content community were the hot 

topics  on the second day of the 2007 International CES&reg;. Industry pioneers from Dell,  

CBS and Cisco delivered addresses on day two, sharing their visions for the  future of 

consumer technology and its unique relationship with the content community.  Produced by 

the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA<sup>&#174</sup>), the 2007 International  CES, 

the world&rsquo;s largest technology tradeshow runs through tomorrow and  celebrates the 

show&rsquo;s 40th anniversary. </p>
<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s morning keynote, presented by Michael Dell, founder  and chairman, Dell, 

Inc., was chock-full of announcements related to new  hardware, customer programs and a 

landmark environmental program.&nbsp;Joined  by Paul DiMeo, a regular designer on 

&ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,&rdquo; Dell highlighted  the company&rsquo;s 

community outreach via the popular ABC series and announced its  first home entertainment 

suite, which will feature the industry&rsquo;s first  high-definition television&nbsp; 

(HDTV) tuner.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Joined by  a &ldquo;Dr. Evil&rdquo; look-alike, Dell announced a new service called 

DataSafe, allowing  users to back up files online with a password protected program and 

have their  data pushed to a new system. Additionally, in keeping with Dell&rsquo;s  

ever-expanding focus on gaming, Dell announced its new XPS 710 computer system,  which 

utilizes liquid and ceramics and optimizes heavy gaming. </p>
<p>Dell&rsquo;s  keynote concluded with the unveiling of a new environmental program, 

&ldquo;Plant a  Tree for Me.&rdquo; The new program, which will allow Dell&rsquo;s 

customers to donate $2  for each notebook computer and $6 for each desktop PC they buy, 

will benefit  the Conservation Fund and the Carbonfund, two nonprofit groups that promote  

ways to reduce or offset carbon emissions. &ldquo;I challenge every PC vendor in the  

industry to join us in providing free recycling,&rdquo; said Dell.</p>
<p>Leslie Moonves,  president and CEO of CBS Corporation, captured a large audience with a 

keynote  address focused on the future and growth of the content industry. Moonves  shared 

the stage with a wide range of stars and talent from the interactive  content community and 

CBS Corporation. Joining Moonves were Anthony Zuiker, creator  of &ldquo;CSI: CRIME SCENE 

INVESTIGATION;&rdquo; College Sports Television Founder and  President Brian Bedol; the 

hosts of the &ldquo;Opie and Anthony&rdquo; radio show and Ilene  Chaikin and Jennifer 

Beals, creator and star, respectively, of Showtime&rsquo;s, &ldquo;The  L Word.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />
  During his address Moonves declared that there  is no new media or old media, just media. 

To address the shift in the way media  is consumed, Moonves announced many key partnerships 

with other leading members  of the content community. Joining him on stage during these 

announcements were  Linden Lab Founder and CEO Philip Rosedale, who showcased the virtual 

world,  &ldquo;Second Life;&rdquo; Sling Media Co-Founder and CEO Blake Krikorian, who 

introduced a  new service offered by CBS and Sling Media called, &ldquo;Clip and 

Sling,&rdquo; and Chad  Hurley, Co-Founder and CEO of YouTube. Moonves concluded by saying 

that  audiences and the content community now realize anything is possible in the  digital 

realm.</p>
<p><br />
  Cisco Systems Chairman and CEO John Chambers delivered  an Industry Insider address to a 

crowded Hilton Theater audience about  &quot;The Human Network.&quot;&nbsp; Identified as 

one of the top four focal  points for the company in the next decade, the human network or 

connected  consumer experience requires complex technology and a simple user experience,  

Chambers said.&nbsp;The human network - the convergence of all forms of human  expression - 

is safe, open, simple and virtualized.&nbsp; </br>
<p>  Chambers walked the audience through several  demonstrations of the human network 

throughout his presentation, which included  devices that self-install and register, RFID 

technology allowing consumers to  purchase sports tickets on their TV and have them 

delivered to their cell phone,  and live TV chats with friends.&nbsp;Cisco is uniquely 

capable of providing the  human network, Chambers said, because it has a broad technology 

base,  convergence expertise, strong partnerships and is device neutral, content  agnostic, 

standards based and customer focused.&nbsp;<br />
