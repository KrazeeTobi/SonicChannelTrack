			<td><br><img src=/shared_files/techspeakers_photos/Rothman_Wilson.jpg align=left valign="top">&nbsp;Wilson Rothman, features editor at the immensely popular tech blog Gizmodo, has covered consumer electronics for the better part of a decade. He started at Time Magazine and its tech monthly offshoot Time Digital (which became On Magazine). Following the demise of On, he began an illustrious freelance career on the technology beat, writing regularly for Time, The New York Times and Money Magazine while also contributing features to magazines such as Readers Digest, Wired and This Old House. For four years he wrote the Gadget of the Week column on Time.com, before jumping to Gizmodo in the spring of 2007. In his increasingly rare spare time, he continues to write for Money Magazine and various other print publications. Wilson lives in Mount Kisco, NY with his wife Jennifer.</td>
