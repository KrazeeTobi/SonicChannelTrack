			<td><br><img src=/shared_files/techspeakers_photos/VonBuskirk_Eliot.JPG align=left valign="top">&nbsp;Wired News blogger and columnist Eliot Van Buskirk has covered digital music ever since seeing the world's first MP3 player on a colleague's desk at CNET.  As a child, he used most of the money from New York City Opera appearances to buy the Atari 2600 and other new electronics, and soon after began programming on a Commodore Vic-20.  Having made shockingly little progress during the intervening decades, he continues to be deeply involved in both music and technology, having written product reviews, news stories, and opinion columns for CNET for nearly a decade, and now covering digital music issues for Wired News.  Van Buskirk has also written and/or edited a smattering of technology-related books, including <u>Burning Down the House: Ripping, Recording, Remixing, and More</u>, and regularly appears on NPR and other media outlets to discuss the continuing collision of music and technology.</td>
