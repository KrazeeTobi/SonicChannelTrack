The scores are combined,&nbsp; resulting in a single score for each product. A baseline value is derived from the cumulative scores in a category.

<P><STRONG>Can&nbsp;an&nbsp;entry submitted last year be submitted again this year?&nbsp; </STRONG><BR>Entries submitted last year can probably not be submitted this year, since the competition is limited to new products that become available to consumers from March 1, 2007 through February 29, 2008. However, if you have developed a new model of the product that you feel is innovative and enhances the original product, you may submit an entry for the new model. </P>

Your entry form will not be processed without a minimum two different high resolution photos of your product. While two photos are required, you can upload up to five photos per entry. All photos must be submitted via the online submission process. E-mailed and hard copy photos will no longer be accepted.</P>
<P><STRONG>Do I have&nbsp;a word limit, per questions, on the entry form?</STRONG><BR>The limit is up to 250 words per question. You may also upload the technical specification sheet for your product. If you do not have a specification sheet, you may provide the same data in your own words. </P>
<P><STRONG>What happens if my entry is not complete?&nbsp;<BR></STRONG>An entry is qualified for judging when all required sections are completed, images are included, and all entry fees have been paid.

Ultimately, it is the submitter’s responsibility to ensure the entry is complete. Incomplete entries will be disqualified. Entry fees are non-refundable.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>When will I find out if my product has been selected to received an award? <BR></STRONG>All applicants will be notified via e-mail October 31, 2007. If selected as an honoree, you are requested to confirm information included in your entry. It is essential that we receive this information for the announcement scheduled at the New York press event on November 13, 2007.&nbsp; </P>

<UL>
<LI>Companies whose products will be displayed “live” must supply the necessary auxiliary equipment, including all cables, connectors, and program sources, along with copyright-cleared audio and video programs.
