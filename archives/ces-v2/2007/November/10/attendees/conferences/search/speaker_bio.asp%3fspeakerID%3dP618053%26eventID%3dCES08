Bocko has significantly contributed to the emergence of the TFT-LCD industry and its progress with continual substrate innovations.  He joined Corning in 1979 as a scientist in Glass Chemistry.  He participated in Corning’s first technical marketing effort in LCD glass substrates in 1982.  In 1988, Dr. Bocko became technical leader of the LCD project and went on to hold a variety of technical and commercial leadership positions in Corning’s Display Technologies business.  In 2004, he was named division vice president – Display Technologies.  Throughout his career, he has employed an early-stage collaborative approach that has yielded a deep understanding of customers’ barriers to success.  His approach and technical expertise have yielded a succession of substrate breakthroughs beginning with Corning 7059, the company’s proprietary fusion glass for first-generation processes and culminating in EAGLE XG™, the industry’s most environmentally friendly TFT-LCD substrate.<br><br>
Dr. Bocko has focused on helping Corning deliver advanced display materials solutions for emerging technologies. His product concept portfolio has been expanded to included projects like fusion-formed polysilicon substrates and all-glass packaging for OLEDs.  In October 2007, Dr. Bocko was named chief technology officer, Japan, allowing him to integrate his early-stage customer collaboration approach across all businesses.
