His interest in electronics started at a young age with rigorous experimentation, a method of inventing that continues to this day.<br><br>
Mr. Norris joined the U.S. Air Force in 1956 and was trained as a Nuclear Weapons Specialist, specializing in electronic fusing systems. He studied electronics at the University of New Mexico. After his honorable discharge in 1959, Mr. Norris began employment at the University of Washington where he continued his practical education, elevating from technician to Director of the Engineering Experiment Station for the campus within two years.<br><br>
Many of Mr. Norris's inventions are not just single product ideas; they shatter technology barriers creating multiple applications and a lasting impact.  The inventions of Woody Norris have been the keystone for several new companies.  In 1980, he founded (and is currently Chairman of) American Technology Corporation (ATC) as a means to promote certain of his inventions.  Today, ATC is publicly traded and is marketing acoustic products to customers around the world. <br><br></td>
