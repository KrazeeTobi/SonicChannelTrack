<span class="section_title">Product Convergence, Wireless Technology, Public Policy Highlight Action Packed Day at CES</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/11/2003</i></strong>
<br><br>
Thousands of industry executives from 100 countries explored the true sense of technological convergence in an exciting day at the 2003 International CES.  In addition to scouring a busy show floor, attendees gained a glimpse into the future of embedded technology and learned the latest trends in wireless and electronic gaming.  The 2003 International CES runs through Sunday at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nev. <p>

"People are truly witnessing the explosion of technological innovation at CES," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of the International CES.  "The digital age has arrived in style with thousands of pint-sized efficient devices working seamlessly via wireless connection performing multi-functions showering the CES floor."<p>

Day two opened with a look into the progress of embedded technology.  Texas Instruments President Tom Engibous' keynote focused on signal processing and the advances it has brought to the consumer electronics industry.  According to Engibous, signal processing has been the technology of choice for digital audio, video, cell phones, broadband communications and wireless networking.  <p>

Engibous demonstrated an array of new PDAs, cell phones, camcorders, video-audio players and digital cameras, all if which illustrate how signal processing has brought Internet connectivity to CE products and has dramatically increased their functionality.  He also discussed how signal processing mirrors the people who are using it, since it extends human capabilities and enriches life experience.<p>

CEA President and CEO Gary Shapiro held a special one-on-one session on technology policy with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Michael Powell.  Powell announced the Commission had started the formal process that will lead to regulations governing DTV cable compatibility.  Powell cited progress made by the television broadcast build out and strict deadlines for the build out as key factors in speeding up the transition to digital.<p>

Shapiro and Powell also discussed spectrum issues including the maximization of current demands and uses of spectrum and the need for a new model harnessing technology that creates better sharing of existing spectrum for future use.  In addition, they talked about the need to balance copyright concerns with consumers' rights.  Powell praised the TiVo he received for Christmas.  Moving on to other issues, Powell cited the need to expand access to broadband technology as a national priority.  Powell announced the FCC will hold five major proceedings in the new year to help speed up the process.  In closing, the Chairman listed the top three priorities for the FCC in the coming year: spectrum, broadband and business competition policy.<p>

This afternoon's Industry Insider Series with RealNetworks Founder and CEO Rob Glaser looked at media delivery over digital networks. Glaser said, "Over one billion devices will be connected to the network by the middle of the decade. There already are 300 million today." He identified three challenges to overcome before these Internet devices proliferate: ensure devices can talk to each other; establish common ground between consumers; content media and CE companies; and make the digital experience easy. He announced the Helix DRM that allows content owners and CE manufacturers to use a digital rights management system for both standards-based and Internet media formats. He said, "Helix DRM will unleash a new wave of legal, digital content for consumers to enjoy at home and on the go."<p>

Top female executives from the manufacturing, retail, marketing and media arenas came together to discuss the evolving role of women in the CE industry.  The panelists stressed the importance of recognizing the potential of the female market throughout the buying chain: manufacturers, marketers, retail outlets and the media all share the burden.  Manufacturers and marketers alike need to understand the behavior of female technology consumers so that they can more effectively design and market products to them.  Panelists cited the need for retailers to develop sales models that are more focused on the benefits of a purchase.  Generation gaps present new challenges as younger, tech-savvy women increase spending.  Specifically integrating technology coverage will more accurately reflect the role that technology plays in women's lives - essential, yet seamlessly incorporated among the other parts of their workstyles and lifestyles.<p>

CES' first Gaming SuperSession took a look at the future of the industry, the youth market, interactive games, as well as the impact of online gaming.  The discussion covered an array of topics including the at-home market, HD gaming graphics and software, the potential of the wireless market and all the promise of the up-and-coming online multiplayer environment. <p>

In a special CES Wireless SuperSession, a group of industry experts discussed everything from new networks, new products, enhanced capabilities, convergence and consumer adoption of 3G, and what we can learn from the Asian and European market introduction of GSM.  The presentation concluded with a question and answer session which left many of the session attendees in conversations of their own on why the believe wireless has become such a fast mover in the history of the consumer electronics industry.<p>
