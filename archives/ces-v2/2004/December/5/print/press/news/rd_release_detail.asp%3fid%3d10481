<span class="section_title">Global Business Markets Congregate At the 2004 International CES, According To Independent Audit </span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">132,853 Industry Professionals Attend CES for New Products, Networking and Education</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;5/3/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
Bringing together business leaders from more than two dozen global markets, 132,853 industry professionals congregated at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) January 8-11, 2004 in Las Vegas, Nev., as reported by VERIS Consulting's independent audit released this week.  
<p>
"These figures underscore what we have long believed-the International CES is the world's largest and greatest meeting place for anyone and everyone involved in consumer technology," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of the International CES.  
<p>
The 2004 International CES was the largest ever in terms of attendance and square footage in the 38-year history of the show.  Total 2004 attendance jumped 13 percent over 2003 numbers, and the show floor expanded by 14 percent with 2,491 exhibitors in 1.4 million net square feet of exhibit space.  
<p>
Significant companies in the entertainment, automotive, aerospace, building and construction, communications and telecom, medical and healthcare, travel and hospitality, education, finance and information technology industries attend CES.  For example, nearly 7,000 entertainment executives attended the 2004 International CES.
<p>
CES continues to bring in the top business leaders in all product categories and market segments.  The number of presidents, CEOs and business owners at CES skyrocketed 31 percent over 2003 levels.  According to the VERIS audit, one out of three CES attendees is a senior level executive (CEO, owner, president, vice president, director or general manager), and one out of three attendees can make final decisions on new product buys and partnerships.  Eighty-nine percent of the industry's leaders with buying power (representing $90 billion in factory-to-dealer U.S. sales) attend CES, from large national and regional chains, to e-commerce sites and specialty storefronts.
<p>
With buyers from 105 countries, overall international attendance rose 12 percent compared to 2003 figures. Other key attendee segments experiencing significant growth were engineers (45 percent increase), content developers (44 percent increase), installers (23 percent increase) and government professionals (a whopping 98 percent increase). CES also continues to bring in new buyers, with 40 percent of non-exhibiting attendees coming to the show for the first time in 2004.   
<p>
With more than 120 government officials and key staff in attendance, including members of Congress, top agency officials and state legislators, CES has more government VIPs than any other non-government-sponsored trade event held in the United States.  Plus, more than 200 education organizations and universities attended the 2004 International CES to buy products and investigate new technology.  
<p>
CES jumpstarts the worldwide industry buzz each year with media and analysts flocking to the show to see what's new in technology.  Analyst attendance rose 19 percent in 2004, and total media attendance increased 9 percent over 2003 numbers.
<p>
VERIS Consulting audited CEA tradeshow attendance records, verifying CEA's 2004 International CES registration procedures and record keeping systems.  A VERIS Consulting tradeshow audit provides verification of exhibition records, including direct on-site observation, examination of registration systems and testing of attendee records. Total attendance counts are verified, as well as records and record-keeping systems. Post-show analysis includes direct confirmation sampling, reconciliation of attendance lists, elimination of duplicate names and verification of demographic data with source documentation.
<p>
Leading the tradeshow industry, CEA began independent audits for the International CES in 1997.  Often final audit numbers can differ from estimates given on-site due to additional badge pick-ups and badge reader reports.
<p>
"The tradeshow industry must prove the quality of their shows' attendance to their exhibitors. CES is one of the few that stands behind its attendee numbers every year," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences for CEA.  "In fact, the 2004 International CES attendance was slightly higher than we originally announced on the last day of the show."
<p>
With more than 1.2 million square feet of exhibit space already sold, the 2005 International CES will be held Thursday, January 6 through Sunday, January 9, in Las Vegas.  CES is the largest annual tradeshow in North America, per Tradeshow Week.

<p>
Note to Journalists: General press and analyst registration will open in July.  Pre-qualified media registration will open in June.  Detailed press conference information will be available later this year. Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 4, 2005 to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events.
