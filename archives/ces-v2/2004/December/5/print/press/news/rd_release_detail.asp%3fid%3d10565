<span class="section_title">Enabling Technology Forums Highlight Hi-Tech Content At 2005 International CES</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">CEA And Horizon Events To Co-Locate New Conference Tracks Focused On CE Semiconductor Technologies</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;10/4/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and Horizon Events announced the creation of a new conference program for semiconductor and other component technology vendors at the 2005 International CES.  The Enabling Technology Forums, a co-located conference event within CES, will deliver three days of technology briefings beginning Wednesday, January 5, 2005.  The event will offer dozens of tracks presenting valuable information and insight on the underlying technologies that will enable the next generation of consumer devices and systems.
<p> 
"The forums' focus in on the technologies needed to make tomorrow's winning consumer devices," said Rich McComas, CEO of Horizon Events.  "The semiconductor companies are setting the standards, building the platforms, and paving the way for tomorrow's hot features. The best place to make the OEM connection is at CES."   
<p>
The Enabling Technology Forums (ETF) will be presented as several independently run forums, with the ambitious goal of creating a concentrated debate about future CE technologies in one place - the 2005 International CES.  
<p>
"As the International CES( continues to evolve with the world of consumer technology, so do the show's multifaceted conferences offered for our attendees," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences for the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of CES.  "We are thrilled to have Horizon Events offer these innovative forums that contribute towards the educational experience of CES." 
<p>
The Enabling Technology Forums will occur in the Riviera Conference Center, across the street from the Las Vegas convention center and Hilton conference center.  A unique feature of the conference is the use of large luxury skyboxes overlooking the ballroom as break-out rooms.  The first keynote address will be presented Wednesday morning, the day before the CES trade show floor opens.   The conference sessions will run in the mornings on Thursday and Friday, leaving afternoons and evenings open for appointments and trade show attendance.
<p> 
ETF content will be tailored to meet the needs of the OEM exhibitors and members of the hi-tech press.  OEM exhibitors at CES are encouraged to direct their technical staff, decision makers, marketing personnel, and R&D teams to take advantage of this unique conference track.  Component technology vendors interested in participating in this exciting event are urged to contact Horizon Events immediately to discuss participation, as space is limited.  Speaker/sponsor resources for this event are available online at www.horizonevents.com, and attendee conference information will be published at www.cesweb.org and at www.enablingtechnologyforums.com.
<p> 
The 2005 International CES is the world's largest annual event for consumer technology.  For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information. 
<p> 
Note to Hi-Tech Journalists: Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 4th to take advantage of all the CES press activities, conferences and events occurring on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 4-5, 2005.
