Press kits and the releases in them can be the most effective communication vessel your company possesses. The tradeshow norm, press kits offer press and analysts a concise package to learn about your business background and roadmap, products, company announcements, and other key communication pieces.

<div class="section_title">Press Kit Preparation</div>
<span class="text">
<SPAN class=subhead>What goes in a press kit?</SPAN><BR>Press kits are a one-stop source for the media to get information about your company and products. Information included in kits should be kept simple and to the pointâ€”journalists are not interested in slick marketing materials or brochures; they are after hard news. The best kits are enclosed neatly in a folder that is marked clearly with the company's name and CES booth number on the outside for easy reference. Loose brochures or flyers are discouraged, but CD-ROMS and single press releases will be distributed. While creativity is key in distinguishing your kits from others, keep in mind that most kits that are not in standard-sized folders are often passed over or thrown out. 
<P>You might also consider an electronic press kit.&nbsp; Recent CES surveys show that the media prefer online or CD-ROM kits.&nbsp; These kits should&nbsp;contain the same information as hard copy kits.&nbsp; More information on online press kits can be found in the <A href="/print/exhibitors/pr/pr_kit/kit.asp#1379">Online Media Center</A>&nbsp;section of the Exhibitor PR Kit.</P>Most press kits typically include all or some of the following: 
<UL>
<LI>Recent and relevant news releases (preferably from news at the show) <A href="/print/docs/sample_release.pdf" target=_blank>Download a sample release (pdf).</A> </LI>
<LI>Company/executive backgrounders </LI>
<LI>Detailed product fact sheets/specs </LI>
<LI>Product images </LI>
<LI>Copies of company publications (annual reports, external magazines, etc.) </LI>
<LI>Any special events you have scheduled during the show </LI>
<LI>Media contact information </LI></UL><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Press Kit Tips</SPAN><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Determine the most relevant information to include in the press kit. </LI>
<LI>Order online press kits through the&nbsp;Online Media Center's <A href="http://www.virtualpressoffice.com/CES/order/orderForm.jsp">online order form</A>. </LI>
<LI>For hard copy kits, make sure your company name is clearly listed on the front cover. The press prefers press kits be listed by company, not product name. </LI>
<LI>Send an appropriate number of printed kits. Large exhibitors and those holding important news conferences should send at least 500 kits. For smaller exhibitors and those without any news announcements, 250 should suffice.&nbsp; Please note that you&nbsp;may reduce the amount of printed kits by up to 50 percent if you&nbsp;order online press kits.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Make sure your kits arrive before the press room opens on Tuesday, January 4, 2005, to ensure your kit is picked up by as many press members as possible. </LI>
<LI>All hard-copy press kit materials should be contained in a binder or folder. Kits on CD-ROM or single press releases are an exception. </LI>
<LI>Since a great deal of money is invested in these kits, take some insurance out on your investment. Send the kits through a delivery method that provides a tracking number. This number should be brought with you to CES to assist us in the event that your kits are misplaced. </LI>
<LI>If you have invested in an online kit, include a brightly colored sign in your printed kit that gives the URL address. </LI>
<LI>Check with the CES press kit office staff during the show to determine the number or kits you have remaining. Check again on the last day of the show to collect any unused kits. Kits that are not collected will not be returned. </LI>
<LI>Alexis Park exhibitors must hand carry their kits to the AP press room; we cannot accept shipped kits. </LI></OL><BR><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> CES does not have the facilities or staff to assist you with the transport of press kits from your booth to the press room. Contact GES, 800-475-2098 for labor to transport heavy boxes and materials around the show floor. GES will bill you directly for any labor costs you incur. On-site service orders should be placed through your show location's Exhibitor Service Center. The following service centers will be staffed throughout move in/out and show days: <BR><BR>Las Vegas Convention Center: 
<UL>
<LI>Show location - Central Hall (Tunnel beneath C3 Concourse) </LI>
<LI>Show location - North Hall (Front of North 4 Hall) </LI>
<LI>Show location - South Hall (Rear of South 4) </LI></UL><BR>Las Vegas Hilton: 
<UL>
<LI>Location - Hilton Pavilion (across from ticket booth) </LI></UL><BR><SPAN class=subhead>After the Show</SPAN><BR>Send a follow-up release to the media who attended the show. Include information such as: 
<UL>
<LI>A recap of all activity in your booth </LI>
<LI>Which products attracted the most attention and why </LI>
<LI>Future expectations relating to your company's new products </LI>
<LI>Any upgrade to information contained in your press releases during the show</LI></UL>

<div class="section_title">Investor Relations</div>
<span class="text">
More than 1,500 industry and financial analysts attended the International CES in 2004, and many more will return to Las Vegas in 2005 looking for the companies that are bringing innovative and exciting products to the market and how your company stacks up financially and competitively against the rest. <BR><BR>All analysts receive the same benefits as editorial media, which means access to the press room, press kits, press luncheons and press conferences, as well as free access to the CES paid conference tracks. <BR><BR>The pre-registered media list, posted online beginning November 1, 2004, also contains a list of all pre-registered analysts for CES. <BR><BR>In the months prior to CES, conduct an analyst tour to begin a face-to-face dialog with your core analysts and introduce them to your company and the products you plan on bringing to the show. Tradeshows can be very hectic environments, leaving minimal time for lengthy, one-on-one conversations about the industry, products, etc. An analyst tour will allow you to begin a working relationship with key analysts who will hopefully follow your company in the months and years to come. <BR><BR>Once on-site, it is important to provide the financial community with pertinent financial information about your company. To accomplish this, a number of exhibitors compile a separate investor relations kit in addition to a general press kit. While these kits are similar to press kits, they contain more tailored information including: 
<UL>
<LI>Earnings announcements 
<LI>Annual reports 
<LI>Stock charts/history 
<LI>Company/executive backgrounders 
<LI>FAQs 
<LI>News releases </LI></UL><BR>It is important to note that while separate investor relations kits are a valuable tool, a number of companies choose to integrate financial materials into their regular press kits since analysts are welcome in the press room.

<div class="section_title">Press and Investor Relations Kit Distribution</div>
<span class="text">
Your exhibitor press and IR kits provide information about your company to the press and analysts that attend CES. All exhibitor press/IR kits will be distributed from the press room in cubicles labeled alphabetically by company name, while IR kits are kept in the analyst lounge within the press room.&nbsp; Electronic press kits and releases are distributed to those media and analysts in attendance as well as thousands who cannot make it to the show. Only kits of exhibitors at CES are distributed from the press room. Exhibitors sharing booth space must be officially listed in the CES directory to have their press kits distributed. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Delivery Address and Timeline</SPAN><BR>Shipped press/IR kits must arrive between December 26, 2004 and January 3, 2005. Press kits may also be dropped off during press room hours up to January 4. <BR><BR>Electronic press kits may be ordered and set-up at any time prior to, during and even after the event.<BR><BR>If you plan on shipping your press kits to the press room, please mark them to arrive at the LVCC by January 2, 2005, due to the volume of shipments arriving into the LVCC. All shipments arrive at the same distribution center and are then delivered accordingly, which usually takes 2-3 days. <BR><BR><SPAN class=black>Press Kit Mailing Address</SPAN><BR>2005 International CES<BR>Las Vegas Convention Center<BR>Press Room S229<BR>3150 Paradise Rd.<BR>Las Vegas, NV 89109<BR>Phone: (before 1/4/2005) (703) 907-7626<BR>Phone: (after 1/4/2005) (702) 943-3521<BR>E-mail: <A href="mailto:prcontacts@ce.org">prcontacts@ce.org</A> <BR><BR><STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG>Please send Investor Relations Kits to the attention of "Analyst Lounge." <BR><BR>The Press Kit Office is located in the middle of the press room in the South Hall Connector Bridge, room S229.
