<TR>
<TD width=590>An <STRONG>Exhibitor-Appointed Contractor (EAC)</STRONG> is any company other than the designated "official" contractors listed in this service manual, which provides a service (display set-up / tear down, security personnel, florists, photographers, audio/visual, etc.) and needs access to your exhibit anytime during the installation, show dates and dismantling.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>CES Operations&nbsp;will consider exceptions to the use of CES official contractors only in the following cases:</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590>
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Permission has been requested by the exhibitor in writing on the exhibitor's company letterhead, or using the Letter of Intent Form. <STRONG>Authorization requests must come from the exhibiting company.</STRONG> </LI>
<LI>The following EAC paperwork must be completed: <STRONG>EAC Agreement and Certificate of Insurance.</STRONG> (Requests must be accompanied by <STRONG>original</STRONG> Certificates of Insurance for worker's compensation, property damage and personal injury policies of one million dollars ($1,000,000) each. The Consumer Electronics Association, GES, and the appropriate exhibit show locations must be named as additional insured's. Certificates with the coverage's listed above must also be sent to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and GES Exposition Services. All documentation must be received before commencing work on the property of the Las Vegas Convention Center.) </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>CES &amp; GES have been advised of the name, address and contact of each EAC being used. </LI></UL></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR><STRONG>Downloadable EAC paperwork is provided above</STRONG> and must be received by International CES Show Management before 5:00 p.m. EST, Friday, December 3, 2004.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has enacted a policy wherein the Las Vegas Convention Center holds the current list of approved Exhibitor Appointed Contractors on hand at all times, and if the LVCC is notified that work is being performed by a contractor/exhibitor not on the current list, the LVCC shall investigate and take the necessary actions through Show Management to secure compliance with the EAC rules. EAC's intending to work in the LVCC must have approval from the LVCC. For more information, call the LVCC at (702) 892-0711.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>Exceptions to the use of International CES official contractors will be granted only if they do not interfere with or prejudice the orderly set-up, interim services or dismantling of the exhibit. An exception will not be granted if it is inconsistent with the commitments made and obligations assumed by CES&nbsp;Show&nbsp;Management, or in its lease with Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas Hilton, and Alexis Park.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR><B>No requests, addendum or substitutions to an exhibitor's appointed contractor selection received after the deadline of 5:00 p.m. EST on December 3, 2004 will be considered.</B></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>Failure to meet any of the above steps could jeopardize the EAC's ability to obtain proper authorization for installation, servicing or dismantling of exhibiting companies.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>Use of EAC's is subject to International CES' contractual obligations, security and safety requirements. If any exhibitor brings an EAC onto the exhibit floor, that exhibitor is responsible for that contractor's worker's compensation and liability insurance certificates, and must send them to CES, GES and the appropriate show location. Under no circumstances shall these procedures be circumvented. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>In addition, the following requirements must be satisfied by any service contractor, display house or other company providing a service on the Las Vegas Convention Center property:</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR><STRONG>The EAC agrees:</STRONG></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590>
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>To remove all gang boxes, ladders, or other equipment from the aisle or other common areas by the close of work hours each night. The EAC is permitted to store equipment in the exhibitor's booth only. </LI>
<LI>Not to operate a service desk of any type within the exhibit hall, unless specifically approved by International CES. If approved, the service desk is to be set up at the EAC's expense. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>To abide by the rules and regulations of the event as set forth or amended by CES. </LI>
<LI>That they will abide with the fire and safety regulations, all other prevailing regulations of governmental agencies and the exhibit hall. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>That any property of the EAC not removed at the close of working hours is left at their own risk. Further, any such property may be moved, removed or stored at the EAC's expense if it is considered for any reason by International CES to interfere with any aspect of the move-in or move-out. CES reserves the right to require pre-payment as a condition of returning said property. </LI></UL></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>The EAC affirms that they have confirmed work orders from all exhibitors listed above, and that they will not in any manner solicit work from other exhibitors or booths in this show under any circumstances. The EAC must confine its operations to the exhibit area of its clients. No service desk, storage areas or other work facilities shall be located within the exhibit facilities contracted by CES. Show aisles and public space are not considered part of the booth area. The EAC may not, under any circumstances, solicit business on the show floor.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>The EAC further agrees that International CES may expel them from the premises at any time should they be found to be working in any exhibitor's booth not listed above unless authorized in advance by CES.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=590><BR>In addition to any other remedies available at law, CES reserves the right upon notice to the EAC to revoke the approval of the EAC in respect to any or all exhibitors, and/or remove the EAC if: 
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11>a breach by the EAC of any of the provisions of the agreement or a breach by the EAC of any of the rules/regulations, </LI>
<LI>the EAC's participation at the show may lead to strikes, picketing, or other labor action directed at the show, </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>other disruption of the show, </LI>

<span class="subhead">Tips &amp; Tricks: Exhibitor Appointed Contractors</span>
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI class=exhibitor11><B>Order services required from GES Exposition Services in advance.</B> Ordering labor or services on-site which GES may not be prepared to provide immediately, is expensive and may delay the set-up of your booth or force your set-up into overtime. </LI>
<LI>Take steps to protect your client's product in the booth by arranging for booth security and/or cages. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11>Stay out of adjacent booths during set-up. </LI>
<LI><B>Label empty cartons and crates for storage as soon as they are ready.</B> Holding back until the last minute only adds congestion to the aisles. </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11><B>Do not store empty cartons inside of empty crates.</B> Cartons are returned from storage first, so exhibitors may begin packing their product. </LI>
<LI><B>Keep “No Freight Aisles” clear at all times!</B> </LI>
<LI class=exhibitor11><B>Submit outbound freight bills to the service desk in a timely manner.</B> Holding freight bills until late in the day, or turning in large amounts of freight bills to the service desk at one time, may delay outbound truck scheduling and force your loading-out into overtime. </LI></UL>
