<span class="section_title">Bill Gates and Craig Barrett Headline 2005 International CES Conference Program</span>

	<br><br>
	<span class="subhead">Microsoft and Intel Executives to Present CES Keynotes</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;8/5/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced today that top Intel and Microsoft executives will deliver the opening and pre-show keynotes respectively at the 2005 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nev.  
<p>      
Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect of Microsoft Corp., will deliver the Pre-Show Keynote Address on Wednesday, January 5, 2005, at 6:30 p.m.  Craig Barrett, chief executive officer (CEO) of Intel Corp., will deliver the Opening Keynote Address on Thursday, January 6, 2005 at 8:30 a.m.  Barrett's speech will be preceded by State of the Industry addresses from Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, and CEA's Chairman (to be elected in October).  Both keynotes will take place in the Hilton Theater of the Las Vegas Hilton. The 2005 International CES runs January 6-9.
<p>
"As the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, the International CES prides itself on bringing the most influential and notable industry visionaries to our conference program," said Shapiro.  "Microsoft and Intel continue to be international leaders, debuting the latest and greatest technologies for the consumer marketplace each year at CES.  We're thrilled to have Mr. Gates and Dr. Barrett back at CES to show our attendees the new technologies that will make it even simpler for consumers to stay connected, entertained and informed 24/7."
<p>
Under Gates' guidance, Microsoft has become the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.  Building on the popularity of its Windows operating system and Office productivity suite, Microsoft focuses on developing technology for the next-generation Internet and on connected devices that meet consumer demands at work, at home and on the move - such as the Media Center PC, Windows Mobile software for Pocket PCs, Smartphones and Portable Media Centers and the MSN network.
<p>
In the past, Gates has used the International CES to preview products and technologies such as Xbox, Tablet PC, smart personal object technology (SPOT) watches and Smartphone.
<p>
For 35 years, Intel technology has enabled the computer and Internet revolution that has helped change the world. Founded to build semiconductor memory products, Intel introduced the world's first microprocessor in 1971. Today, Intel supplies the computing and communications industries with chips, boards, systems, and software building blocks that are the "ingredients" of computers, servers and networking and communications products.
<p>
Intel CEO Barrett believes that more than two decades of technology innovation - including the personal computer, the Internet, the proliferation of digital devices that connect to PCs, and the onset of wireless communications - has set the stage for even more change in the digital home.  In Intel's vision of the digital home, consumers will be able to enjoy content such as movies, music, games, photos, communication and information at any time, anywhere and on any device.  Barrett said that as PCs and CE devices come together and broadband connections and rich digital media become increasingly available, new opportunities will be created for the computing and consumer electronics industries, content providers and consumers worldwide.
<p>
The 2005 International CES focuses on more than 20 product areas from more than 2,400 exhibitors spread throughout both the inside and outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Las Vegas Hilton, and the Alexis Park Resort. For more news on CES before, during and after the show, visit www.CESweb.org, the interactive source for CES information.
<p>

Journalists are encouraged to arrive in Las Vegas by Tuesday, January 4, 2005 to take advantage of all the CES press conferences and events.  CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of the International CES will run January 4 from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in the Las Vegas Convention Center, room S226, across the hallway from the CES Press Room.  A list of press room hours and services is posted at www.CESweb.org.
