More than 25 technology pavilions showcasing the latest technology shaping the CE industry such as home entertainment, Bluetooth, broadband, imaging technology, MP3 and Memory Stick will take center stage when the 2003 International CES, the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow, returns to Las Vegas January 9-12.<p>

"Technology pavilions allow attendees the opportunity to see first-hand a particular technology that is making a huge impact on the industry," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences for the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of CES.  "Whether it's imaging technology, portable power, SD Card or embedded technologies - CES has it."<p>

One new pavilion sure to draw a crowd is the Xtreme Entertainment Pavilion.  Here, attendees will be thrust into a world of sight and sound showcasing the hottest entertainment technology for the home and on-the-go from companies like Game Spot and Case Logic.  The Xtreme Entertainment Pavilion is located in the front of the upper level of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) South Hall.<p>

Wireless technology is alive and well at the 2003 International CES.  The line-up of technology pavilions reflects this ever-evolving technology.
