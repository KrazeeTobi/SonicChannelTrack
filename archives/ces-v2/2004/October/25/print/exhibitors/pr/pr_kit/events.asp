<div class="section_title">Press Conferences</div>
<span class="text">
A press conference at CES is an excellent way to have the media as a captive audience to debut new products, make a company announcement or introduce a new member to your executive team. If a press conference is part of your marketing strategy, the information below might be of assistance. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Can any company exhibiting at CES hold a press conference or event?<BR></SPAN>Yes, all CES exhibitors are eligible. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Where can press conferences and events be held?<BR></SPAN>They may be held in any of three locations: 1) CES-provided press conference room, 2) exhibitor's booth or 3) exhibitor's paid meeting room. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>I don't have any news to announce, but I would like to host a reception for the press. May I use one of the available rooms for that purpose?<BR></SPAN>Yes, rooms are free for press conferences and events such as receptions or breakfasts. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>How do I request a press conference room?<BR></SPAN>Fill out the <A href="/print/docs/FacilityReservationForm.pdf" target=new>Press Conference Facility Reservation Form</A> and fax it to Leah Arnold at (703) 907-7626. CES will contact you within three business days to finalize arrangements. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>On what dates may press conferences and events be held?<BR></SPAN>Scheduling begins Wednesday, January 5 and runs until Sunday, January 9, 2005. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>At what times may press conferences or events be held?<BR></SPAN>Press conferences or events may be held by written notification before, during or after show hours. However, events held on the show floor before or after show hours require advanced security forms and hired security guards. Please contact Leah Arnold at (703) 907-7626 or <A href="mailto:larnold@ce.org">larnold@ce.org</A> for more information or to receive the 2005 In-Booth Event Form. <BR><SPAN class=subhead>Can I reserve a room for an entire day?<BR></SPAN>No. Rooms may only be reserved in two-hour increments and only one reservation per exhibitor is allowed. Time limits are strictly enforced. If you are planning a large event with complicated staging, lighting or A/V work that might exceed the two-hour limit, you might consider purchasing a meeting room for the duration you need. Contact your <A href="/print/exhibitors/space/contacts.asp">CES business development representative</A> for meeting room availability. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Is there are charge for press conference rooms?<BR></SPAN>No. The three rooms reserved for press conferences are provided free of charge, but exhibitors will be have to pay for any additional A/V equipment or furniture not included in the standard room-set, as well as any desired catering. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>What does the room typically include?<BR></SPAN>
<UL>
<LI>Theatre-style seating for up to 200 people </LI>
<LI>Three draped tables for press kits, sign-in, catering, etc. </LI>
<LI>A podium with light and microphone. (Microphone is connected to house speaker system, so no external speakers are needed) </LI>
<LI>Ethernet line </LI>
<LI>Two easels (one inside and one outside for signage) </LI></UL><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Is signage for the press event provided?<BR></SPAN>No. We provide two easels, but you may contact GES customer service to request custom signage for your event. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Why doesn't CES provide a projector and screen?<BR></SPAN>We have found that no two exhibitor press conferences are the same and each exhibitor has a preference for the type of projector and screen they wish to use. Encore has several different options and it is easiest for the exhibitor to order additional A/V services directly. Other A/V equipment commonly ordered are wireless and/or lavalier microphones. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>How can I make sure that the press attends my event?<BR></SPAN>The pre-registered media list is a database of media and financial analysts that have registered and are expected to attend CES. This list will be available beginning November 1, 2004 on CESweb.org. Use the list to send product information, event invitations and company announcements. This database allows you to identify those journalists that have an interest in your particular product category, including contact information. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>How are the press events publicized?<BR></SPAN>The list of press conferences and events is posted on CESweb.org and is distributed in hard copy from the CES press room and lounges. <BR><BR><SPAN class=subhead>Who should I contact for catering, audio/visual, telephony and signage services?<BR></SPAN>

With proper planning, a CES press event provides a forum to have a large, targeted audience at your disposal so that you may deliver news, demonstrate a new product or introduce a new company executive. <BR><BR>Here are some guidelines to a successful event: 
<OL>
<LI>Establish clear and precise objectives. </LI>
<LI>Decide on a setting that might enhance delivery. You have the option of a conference room, your booth or one of the three rooms CES offers for this purpose. </LI>
<LI>Decide on a strategic date and time to hold the event. Then complete a <A href="/print/docs/FacilityReservationForm.pdf" target=_blank>Press Conference Facility Reservation Form</A> to increase your odds of securing a room at the preferred time. Please note that first requests are rarely available. Please have additional times ready. Times are not confirmed until you receive the press conference agreement from CES. </LI>
<LI>Use the pre-registered media list to identify and target the media and analysts that you wish to attend your event. Try setting a goal and working to meet it. </LI>
<LI>Send electronic or printed invitations to the targeted media one month before CES. </LI>
<LI>Follow-up with phone calls two weeks prior to CES to confirm attendance and remind potential attendees of the date and time. </LI>
<LI>Prepare an announcement about the event to include in your press kits. </LI>
<LI>Make sure to notify CES staff of any changes in the date, time or location of your event—even if it is in your booth or outside the venue of CES. </LI>
<LI>Have a sign-in book or business card collector at the door to see who attends your conference. Send thank you letters to those who attended and include any new information. </LI>
<LI>For those exhibitors requesting an invitation-only event it is important to have someone stationed outside the door to ensure only those with invitations are allowed in. CES does not have the manpower to do this for you.</LI></OL>

Press and exhibitors can hold interviews in designated interview rooms available in the South Hall Connector Bridge. <BR><BR>Interview rooms include a conference table for six people and a restricted single phone line for credit cards only. Request additional services, such as an Ethernet line or speaker phone, at least 48 hours in advance; these services will be billed back to the exhibitor/company making the request. <BR><BR>The rooms can be reserved for up to two hours at a time by contacting Jamie Lilly at <A href="mailto:jlilly@ce.org">jlilly@ce.org</A> or 703-907-7650. <BR><BR>On-site at CES, the rooms can be reserved by stopping by the press room and speaking with the receptionist or by calling the press room directly at 702-943-3521.

<span class="text">
Each year, CES publicizes its exhibitors and their products and technologies to the media in their respective regions. We would like to invite you to participate in this program free of charge. <BR><BR>The regional press releases are a great way to get your company's news and intentions for the show publicized in your region's top news outlets in the weeks leading up to CES. <BR><BR>You can submit a short quote (less than 100 words) about your company's participation at CES to Leah Arnold at <A href="mailto:larnold@ce.org">larnold@ce.org</A>. Each release contains approximately four quotes and inclusion is first-come, first-served. The deadline for inclusion is November 30, 2004. <BR><BR>The quote should be from a high-level executive involved with the show and should highlight anything new and exciting your company plans to showcase as well as why you think CES is important to your company's success. <BR><BR>

Is your company planning a special concert with a popular chart-topper? How about an autograph session with Hollywood royalty or product demonstration with a sports legend? If so, we can’t stress enough to let us know. We can assist you with special security arrangements, staging requirements, catering requests or anything else you need to make your event a success. We’ll even help you publicize it by including event details on CESweb.org, in news releases and in the press room. <BR><BR>Many exhibitors that host special events or celebrities choose not to announce the event until closer to the show or even never at all, and we will certainly accommodate those requests. Your secret is safe with us. In addition, we will also be happy to designate it as a strict invitation-only event should you want to publicize it, but set attendance limits. <BR><BR>If you're planning a celebrity appearance or special event, please complete the <A href="/print/docs/CelebrityForm(1).pdf" target=new>Special Event/Celebrity Appearance Form</A>.
