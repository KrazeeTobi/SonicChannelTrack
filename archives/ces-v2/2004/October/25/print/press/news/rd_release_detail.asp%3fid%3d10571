<br><br>		
<strong><i>Arlington, Virginia&nbsp;-&nbsp;10/12/2004</i></strong>
<br><br>
From the latest digital video and audio products to the hottest in electronic gaming and Internet broadband technologies, the world's must-attend event for digital home entertainment is the 2005 International CES.  Attracting more than 120,000 technology trade professionals, the 2005 International CES is the world's largest annual technology tradeshow.  It runs January 6-9 in Las Vegas, Nev.
<p>
"Consumers are clamoring for new digital entertainment in their homes, adding to the $108 billion consumer electronics market in the U.S. alone," said Karen Chupka, vice president, events and conferences for the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of the International CES.  "The International CES is the place to be to understand and capitalize on this trend.  If you develop, rent, sell or distribute digital entertainment-online or offline-the International CES is the one show that can deliver the entire, cross-vertical, sales channel."
<p>
The International CES attracts high-level executives from throughout the global retailing and buying community. With representation from more than 110 countries, CES buyers encompass the full slate of entertainment retailers: Amazon, Babbages, Best Buy, Cambridge SoundWorks, Circuit City, Crutchfields, eBay, Electronics Boutique, Fry's Electronics, Good Guys, KB Toys, Kmart, Myer-Emco, RadioShack, Ritz Camera, Ryan Homes, Sears, Sound Advice, Target, Toys 'R' Us, Tweeter, Ultimate Electronics and Wal-Mart.
<p>
"CES is the historic launchpad for home entertainment products such as the DVD, PVR, DTV and VCR," continued Chupka. "The industry anxiously waits to see what CES exhibitors unleash at the 2005 show."
<P>
Some of the major home entertainment exhibitors at CES include: Denon, Dolby, Harmon, JVC, Kenwood, Marantz, Monster Cable, Panasonic, Philips, Pioneer, Samsung, Sharp, Sherwood, Sony, THX, Toshiba, Yamaha and Zenith.

The Alexis Park features more than 250 high-performance audio exhibitors. CEA's TechKnow Overload (TKO) exhibit in the LVCC Grand Lobby highlights how digital entertainment companies cater to the tech-savvy college market.
