In addition to the product showcase, the 2004 International CES will feature a conference SuperSession addressing the needs of the female technology consumer. "Shopping Consumer Electronics - Understanding the Female Perspective," will be held Friday, January 9 from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. The session will feature footage from focus groups conducted with female consumers, as well as research on women's views on the consumer electronics retail experience. Panelists will offer and discuss steps the industry can take to more effectively attract and retain female consumers.
      <p>
The Technology is a Girl's Best Friend campaign originated in 2002 and seeks to update common misconceptions regarding technology and women. Contrary to popular belief, women are purchasing electronics in high numbers.  Female consumers will spend an estimated $55 billion in 2003 on consumer electronics products. According to research conducted by CEA, women are involved in almost 75 percent of all electronics purchases. 
      <p>
The campaign additionally aims to increase female awareness about new CE products and trends and continue eliminating misconceptions about women and technology.  Please visit www.ce.org/techgirl or www.CESweb.org/techgirl for more information on Technology is a Girl's Best Friend.
