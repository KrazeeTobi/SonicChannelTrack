<span class="section_title">Largest International CES Ever Ignites Industry Optimism</span>

<br><br>		
<strong><i>Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp;-&nbsp;1/12/2003</i></strong>
<br><br>
The 2003 International CES truly lived up to the label of world's largest consumer technology tradeshow with 116,687 upbeat attendees experiencing the excitement, products and technology provided by 2,283 exhibitors in 1.25 million net square feet of exhibit space. <p>

"With attendees flocking to CES from 128 countries, this show has indeed become the World Cup of Technology.  The 2003 International CES marked a key turning point for the consumer electronics industry.  It was a break-through jump start for the new year that will send the industry on a major upswing," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the producer of the International CES.  <p>

"Our attendees view CES as the place to see the hottest technology in the world, conduct serious business and establish that crucial face-to-face interaction necessary in today's economic climate," noted Shapiro.  "The cutting-edge technology, exhibitors from around the world, phenomenal keynoters and exciting conference sessions, along with the 25 themed pavilions, attracted a diverse audience of top executives from the cable, entertainment, retail, travel, hospitality, insurance, financial, healthcare and manufacturing industries as well as top federal, state and local government officials."<p>

Whether it was audio, video, home entertainment, mobile electronics or home networking, products on the CES floor were digital, small, efficient and more affordable to meet the demands of today's consumer.  <p>

The overall theme of wireless convergence was evident throughout the show floor and put the International CES in the spotlight as the premier wireless tradeshow in the country with an explosion of technology such as Bluetooth, 802.11 and 3G.  <p>

"It was amazing to see how products on the show floor are working together wirelessly to increase their functionality," said Karen Chupka, vice president of events and conferences for CEA.  "This year was truly a spectacular CES and carries forward tremendous momentum for next year.  Through our on-site space selection program, more than one million square feet of space already has been sold for the 2004 International CES."<p>

In addition, some new products and technologies caused quite a stir, starting with the demonstration of Smart Personal Object Technology (SPOT) by Microsoft's Chairman and Chief Software Architect Bill Gates.  Zenith announced more than 40 digital devices, including a digital cable-ready high-definition television and a high-definition personal video recorder (PVR).  Sirius Satellite Radio showed off a new Kenwood car stereo that doubles as a mobile video system, capable of receiving satellite-beamed video as well as radio broadcasts.  XM and Delphi showcased the new SkyFi Radio.  Garmin International launched its next-generation handheld that allows users to chart a course to anyone in their computerized address book and provides vocal turn-by-turn directions to the destination.  And, Archos introduced its modular Video A140, a 40-GB hard drive media player that plays and records MP3, MPEG-4 video and JPEG images.<p>

The realm of home entertainment was represented with products including high-defintion television (HDTV), large plasma and LCD monitors, digital imaging, home video production, PVRs, multi-channel audio-visual systems and surround sound and MP3 audio.  Sanyo showcased the next generation of digital displays, organic light emitting diode (OLED), that's flexible and paper-thin.  Hewlett-Packard introduced their HP Digital Media Receiver with built-in Wi-Fi wireless networking. The receiver attaches to a TV and stereo and pulls photos and songs from a PC on the home network.  <p>

It was standing-room only in the new CES HDTV Sports Bar as attendees mingled with sports stars, saw the latest in high-definition television products and networked with business contacts while catching the NFL playoffs broadcast in HD.  The consumer craze surrounding digital television and new video display technologies was evident on the show floor with amazing presentations of large and small flat screens, LCD, plasma and projection monitors by such exhibitors as Panasonic, Sony, Pioneer, Toshiba, Mitsubishi and Zenith.<p>

CES lived up to its name of world's largest mobile technology tradeshow with a wide array of products occupying the entire North Hall.  Whether it was satellite radio, MP3 audio, mobile telephones, GPS navigation, vehicle location and tracking devices or entertainment, mobile was alive and well at CES.  Attendees were astounded by such products as ZAP's Electric Cars, iBiquity's HD radio, Zandiant Technologies' AutoStream 802.11 In-Car System and Weather Data's Storm Hawk GPS mapping and real-time weather product.  <p>

Another huge trend was evident with displays of countless portable devices aimed at managing consumers' lives, including several wireless phones, PDAs, MP3 players and portable DVD players. Evolution Robotics' ER1 Personal Robot System, Motorola's Digital Camera, Red Peacock's Out & Touch and Skullcandy's Hands-Free Stereo Headphones were just a few products receiving rave reviews.<p>

Crowds of CES goers visited the new Xtreme Entertainment Pavilion to witness live demonstrations of extreme sports by X-gamers Tony Hawk, Dave Mira and Shawn Palmer in a huge half-pipe put on by Case Logic.  Other exhibitors displaying their latest next-generation gear include Ellula, Gibson Labs, Philips and Sensio 3D.<p>

More than 100 government officials attended CES to discuss such issues as copyright, spectrum management and broadband policy.  Several CES conference sessions focused on these issues including a special one-on-one dialogue between CEA's Gary Shapiro and FCC Chairman Michael Powel, a Digital Download copyright session and a Congressional panel, featuring Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), Rick Boucher (D-VA), John Doolittle (R-CA), Donald Payne (D-NJ) and Jerry Waller (R-IL) discussing their perspectives on U.S. policy issues impacting the technology industry.  <p>

Final attendance numbers will be released this spring when an official independent attendee audit conducted by Veris Consulting is completed.  The 2002 International CES featured 99,438 attendees and 2000 exhibitors, showcasing products across 1.2 million net square feet.  The 2004 International CES returns to Las Vegas January 8-11, 2004.<p>
