          <h2>How We Judge</h2>

<p>Each product category has a three-member judging team comprised of an independent industrial designer, an independent engineer and a member of the trade press.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="/CES/media/2014/Innovation%20Awards/IMG_5648.gif" style="width: 400px; height: 267px; float: right; margin: 30px;" />The three-member judging team gives a numerical value to each of the below criteria. The scores are combined, resulting in a cumulative score for each product. A baseline value is derived from the cumulative scores in a category. All scores above the baseline are designated as Honorees.</p>

<p>The Best of Innovation Award will be awarded to the highest-rated product in each category, as long as that product surpasses a previously-determined minimum score. If the highest-rated product in a category does not surpass the minimum score, there will be no Best of Innovation Award for that category. All award designations by our judges are final.</p>

<p>Entries are evaluated on the following criteria:</p>

<h3><strong>General Entries</strong></h3>

          <h2>Entry FAQs</h2>

<p>Becoming a part of the CES Innovation Awards is not hard, but you still may have questions. We&#39;ve answered a few common questions below.</p>

<p><strong>Who is eligible to enter?</strong></p>

<p>Anyone who manufactures, designs, engineers or promotes consumer electronics (CE) products marketed in the United States, or is an authorized agent of the organization or individual, that is authorized to submit entries.</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between Best of Innovation and the Honoree awards?</strong></p>

<p>In the Innovation Awards program, there are two levels of Honorees. The first level is Honoree, and only a fraction of the products entered achieve this title. The second level, Best of Innovation, is a more exclusive award that is given to the highest-rated product in each category, as long as that product scored above a pre-determined score threshold. If the highest-rated product in a certain category did not pass the Best of Innovation score threshold, that category has no Best of Innovation award.</p>

<p><strong>My company is a brand new startup with only a few employees and nothing but a prototype that hasn&#39;t hit the market. Do I stand a chance of receiving an award?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely! The wonderful thing about the Innovation Awards is that a product&#39;s score is based on engineering and design qualities, innovation and value provided to the consumer. We admire brilliant products, so there&rsquo;s no difference if your company has been around for a month or a century, operates globally or locally, or has 10 employees or 10,000.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Innovation Showcase?</strong></p>

<p>The Innovation Showcase is a designated area of the CES show floor where the Honoree products are put on display for the world to see. It is a very high-traffic area and one of the most popular destinations at CES. Innovation Honoree products are encouraged to send a product sample to the area for display, free of charge, as long as the company is a CES exhibitor.</p>

<p><strong>My product fits into multiple categories; which should I enter?</strong></p>

<p>If you are only able to submit one entry, select the category that most completely encompasses your product, or in which you feel your product is most accurately described. However, we welcome you to submit the product into multiple categories, if you prefer. Each category is judged independently, so well-designed products often receive awards in multiple categories. A separate entry fee is required for each category entered.</p>

<p><strong>Can an entry submitted last year be submitted again this year?</strong></p>

<p>Entries submitted last year are most likely ineligible for submission this year, since the competition is limited to new products that become available to consumers from April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016. However, if you have developed a new model of the product that you feel is innovative and enhances the original product, you may submit an entry for the new model.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have a word limit for questions on the entry form?</strong></p>

<p>On the product-specific questions, we impose a limit of 500 words. You may also upload the technical specification sheet for your product. If you do not have a specification sheet, you may provide the same data in your own words (1,000 character limit).</p>

<p><strong>What happens if my entry is not complete?</strong></p>

<p>An entry is qualified for judging when all required sections are completed, images are included, and all entry fees have been paid. While CEA is not responsible for the follow-up of incomplete entries, we will attempt to notify entrants of the status of their entry. Ultimately, it is the entrants&rsquo; responsibility to ensure the entry is complete. Unpaid entries will be disqualified. Entry fees are non-refundable.</p>

<p><strong>If I secure space for CES after submitting my Innovation Awards entry, can I receive a partial refund on my Innovation Awards entry fee?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>If you are not a CES exhibitor at the time that you submit your Innovation Awards application, you can still become an official exhibitor and receive a partial refund up until October 14, 2015. After October 14, we are unable to issue partial refunds. Contact us at <a href="mailto:InnovationAwards@ce.org">InnovationAwards@ce.org</a> for more information on receiving a refund.</p>

<p><strong>When will I find out if my product has been selected to receive an award?</strong></p>

<p>All applicants will be notified by email on October 15, 2015 of their award status. If selected as an Honoree, you are requested to confirm information included in your entry. It is essential that we receive this information for the Honoree announcement at CES Unveiled New York on November 10, 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Are there sponsorship opportunities for Innovations?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:InnovationAwards@ce.org">InnovationAwards@ce.org</a></p>
