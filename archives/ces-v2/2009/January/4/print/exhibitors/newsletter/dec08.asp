    <p><strong>The 2009 International CES: Final Checklist</strong><br> by Dan Cole</p>
    <p>With all of the hectic preparations surrounding the upcoming 2009 International CES and the current economic uncertainty, I believe most of us welcomed the brief respite that is the Thanksgiving holiday. As much as your schedule and business obligations will allow, I hope&nbsp; you enjoyed&nbsp; this time with family and friends. Turned off the news and enjoyed a good football game. Indulged in some turkey, dressing and pumpkin pie, shared amusing stories around the dinner table.&nbsp; Whatever you did, I hope you took this opportunity to rest, recharge and refocus. <BR><BR>The next time you hear from me, the 2009 International CES will be gearing up. Every year after returning from Las Vegas, my team conducts a post-show debrief. Only several days removed from the fervor of the show, I remind them that “before you know it, we will be boarding planes to head back out to CES again.” For all of us, that time is now. If you haven't tied up your loose ends, it's not too late.&nbsp; Here is a “final checklist” to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.<BR><BR>Make sure to finalize your directory listing. The main print directory has been finalized and has been shipped off to print, but there is still time to make adjustments to the online directory through CESweb.org.&nbsp; We also produce a printed directory addendum which is distributed onsite and captures last minute changes and additions to the exhibitor directory. And don't forget to maximize your exposure in over 1.4 million unique ways with an advanced listing package through the CES Smartbooth web portal. <BR><BR>Get those service orders in! They say the early bird gets the worm and at CES, they also save some money as well.&nbsp; By December 15th, most service orders must be completed to avoid late charges including booth carpet, hardwall booth packages, GES/GEM system rentals and I &amp; D labor.&nbsp; Others like electrical and hanging signs are due as early as December 8th.</p>

    <p><strong>The 2009 International CES: Final Checklist</strong><br> by Dan Cole</p>
    <p>With all of the hectic preparations surrounding the upcoming 2009 International CES and the current economic uncertainty, I believe most of us welcomed the brief respite that is the Thanksgiving holiday. As much as your schedule and business obligations will allow, I hope&nbsp; you enjoyed&nbsp; this time with family and friends. Turned off the news and enjoyed a good football game. Indulged in some turkey, dressing and pumpkin pie, shared amusing stories around the dinner table.&nbsp; Whatever you did, I hope you took this opportunity to rest, recharge and refocus. <BR><BR>The next time you hear from me, the 2009 International CES will be gearing up. Every year after returning from Las Vegas, my team conducts a post-show debrief. Only several days removed from the fervor of the show, I remind them that “before you know it, we will be boarding planes to head back out to CES again.” For all of us, that time is now. If you haven't tied up your loose ends, it's not too late.&nbsp; Here is a “final checklist” to make sure nothing slips through the cracks.<BR><BR>Make sure to finalize your directory listing.

And don't forget to maximize your exposure in over 1.4 million unique ways with an advanced listing package through the CES Smartbooth web portal. <BR><BR>Get those service orders in! They say the early bird gets the worm and at CES, they also save some money as well.&nbsp; By December 15th, most service orders must be completed to avoid late charges including booth carpet, hardwall booth packages, GES/GEM system rentals and I &amp; D labor.&nbsp; Others like electrical and hanging signs are due as early as December 8th.</p>
