More than 950 technology companies from outside the United States will be among the more than 2,500 exhibitors showcasing the latest consumer electronics (CE) products at the 2010 International CES – the world's largest consumer technology tradeshow. The 2010 International CES runs January 7-10 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will attract more than 22,000 international attendees from 140 countries. <BR><BR>“CES is the place to feel the pulse of the CE industry and to network with the right people for your business,” said Radomir Jovanovic, president and CEO, SPiDCOM Technologies, a French fabless manufacturer of HomePlug AV and Ethernet over Coax (EoC) semiconductors. “This year, we are introducing to the US market our SPC300 ‘no-limits’ HomePlug AV SoC, honored with the prestigious CES Innovations 2010 Design and Engineering Award.” <BR><BR>“Each year we have increased our presence at CES, as the success of the show demands it,” said David Harold, PR director of UK- based Imagination Technologies. “This year we are debuting our consumer brand PURE in the USA, as well as showing the latest developments in our graphics, processor and communications technologies. We didn't consider any other venue for that debut. It had to be CES, as there is no other show that provides such an impressive launch pad for new CE products.” <BR><BR>CES will host new <A href="/exhibits/displays/default.asp">CE Spotlights</A> on the show floor, including new destinations: EHX@CES, a dedicated show experience with free manufacturer training, an exclusive attendee reception, complimentary access to the high-performance audio demo rooms and CE Pro Headquarters; <A href="/exhibits/displays/ilounge.asp">iLounge Pavilion</A> will feature the latest and greatest iPod, iPhone and Macintosh related products and technologies; and Living in Digital Times, which turns the concept of a traditional exhibit upside-down with focus on technology that's relevant to particular lifestyles. After successful launches of Kids@Play and the Silvers Summit, <A href="/exhibits/displays/livingDigital.asp">Living in Digital Times</A> is now adding the Digital Health Summit, Mommy Tech and HigherEd Tech Zones. <BR><BR>“The International CES is a hugely effective platform that allows our company to share exciting news with other people in our industry,“ said Raj Jain, founder and president of Ontario, Canada-based SVAT Electronics/Defender. “We are doing everything we can to innovate within the video security market and are getting more involved with valuable programs such as ENERGY STAR. We are eager to show everyone at CES what we've been up to.” <BR><BR>Other must-see attractions include: <A href="/exhibits/displays/gamingShowcase.asp">The Gaming Showcase</A> which is back and bigger than ever before featuring gaming hardware and software with the entire range of consumer electronics products — from online PC and HD gaming, plasma HDTV and home theater furniture to surround sound and power conditioning hardware.

<div class="sub-content-header">Green is the New Black and Other Top Trends for 2010 CES</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><span class="smallText">Jul 21, 2009 03:43:02</span></i>

<br /><br />

<IMG height=110 hspace=5 src="/images/photos/ShawnDuBravac_photo.jpg" width=79 align=right>Each January, CES emerges as the platform for product launches and entirely new product categories. 2010 is shaping up to be no different. Here’s a quick shot from CEA Research Director and Economist Shawn DuBravac about what developments playing out at the 2010 CES might emerge as game changers in the years to come.&nbsp;<A href="/news/topTrends.asp">Look here for more trends as the show draws near.</A><EM><BR></EM><BR><BR>
<H3>2010 CES Marks the Year of the App.</H3>Apps came on in a very big way in 2009, but the momentum is just beginning. From Facebook to the iPhone, the app is emerging as a key venue for accessing content in an easy and intuitive way. 2009 CES brought us one of the first looks at apps for the TV and we expect to see the app flood the <A href="/exhibits/facilities/default.asp">show floor</A> in 2010. Throughout 2009, many companies have worked to attract developers to their platforms we expect to see the fruit of these labors revealed at the 2010 CES. Apps will be everywhere at CES this year and only the discerning eye will be able to see the choice winners and game changers. Ultimately, this story is about control of content and information flow. Beyond apps, look for developments in other areas (like software) that will work to streamline managing the flow of content across devices. This January, check out the <A href="/events/default.asp">Mobile Apps Showdown</A>.<BR><BR>
<H3>iPhone Wonderland and Battle for the Palm.</H3>With a dedicated section of CES for the first-time ever, we expect to see major announcements coming from the <A href="/exhibits/displays/ilounge.asp">iLounge Pavilion</A> at the 2010 CES. Companies across the globe, continue to look for ways to leverage the popularity and success of the iPhone. But at the same time, the Palm Pre — released at the 2009 CES to rave reviews — is finding its own success in the marketplace as are other mobile devices. Don’t expect the iLounge Pavilion to steal all of the thunder around the 2010 CES. There will be major announcements elsewhere within the mobile phone environment. We expect to see app store launches — building off the first trend listed above and trying to bring relevancy and increased usefulness to mobile platforms. We expect to see new portable products launches as well. We expect to see this play out on both the hardware and software side. Beyond the phone, look for other portable products. The 2009 show only gave a hint of what’s to come for mobile phones, netbooks, e-readers, and <A href="/digitalImaging/default.asp">digital imaging</A>.<BR><BR>
<H3>Green is the New Black.</H3>The green story will change in a major way at CES. To some degree this story has historically been altruistic — do what is right because it is right. But being kind to the environment has taken an important step forward and there are several catalysts that will propel the category forward at CES. Consumers want more from their devices when they are on the go — which means they need power that can keep up with both their increased needs as well as the huge jump in increased computer power today’s portable devices bring to the table. The government is getting behind this movement with their wallet which is shining new light on overall green trends. VCs — leery of a deteriorating economy — continue to invest their own dollar here as well. Green trends at the 2010 CES will step beyond just eco-friendly design and packaging. Green will be big at 2010 CES because it makes sense financially and is gaining traction within the marketplace. Look for unique and compelling use of LED and e-ink, and check out <A href="/exhibits/displays/sustaintablePlanet.asp">Sustainable Planet</A>.<BR><BR>
<H3>Software will be Biggest Incognito Category at the 2010 CES.</H3>The launch of Windows 7 is opening to a crescendo of excitement. Early pre-orders are selling out across the globe. Will we see new hardware offerings trying to take advantage of Windows 7 capabilities? Certainly, we will see other OS emerge as major stories at CES — from the mobile environment to in-the-home applications.

<div class="sub-content-header">To Exhibit or Not to Exhibit During a Recession: Use Numbers to Help You Decide</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><span class="smallText">Jul 13, 2009 02:29:04</span></i>

<br /><br />

<IMG height=105 hspace=5 src="/images/content/Susan_Littleton.jpg" width=88 align=right>There have been at least eight recessions I can think of in my life, and they all carried with them similar, not-surprising markers. Spend less. Think more about how to allocate money. Sacrifice frills to keep necessities part of the routine. I still go to the grocery store every week, but I’m skipping the ice cream aisle. I’m not putting off medical appointments, but I may wait to see the movie I want until it comes out on DVD. <BR><BR>When it comes to business, I find myself asking, “Are events like CES frills or necessity? Do they deserve to stay in a company's marketing mix, or do they fall to the wayside until the budget belt loosens a bit?” <BR><BR>Recent reports from the Center for Exhibition Industry Research (CEIR) offer a powerful “industry events are necessary” answer, and they offer the numbers to prove it. Take a look at what CEIR has to say about the trends of tradeshow activity during a recession, and to see the actual numbers, visit the organization's site at www. CEIR.org: <BR><BR>1. Exhibitions attract the same high quality audience before, during and after business recessions. Plus, the people there still plan on actually buying products.<BR>2. Exhibitions provide the highest concentration of prospects one can reach. Recessions have little to no impact on the percentage of new attendees or the percentage of attendees planning to buy one or more products as a result of what they saw at an exhibition.<BR>3. Recessions also have little effect on several other attendee behaviors, such as audience interest, average hours spent on the show floor, number of first-time attendees, amount of time spent visiting exhibits, total buying plans and the percentage of final decision makers.<BR><BR>CEIR also succinctly outlined just how much money exhibiting at a tradeshow can actually save. On average, making contact with a prospect without a lead from an exhibition costs more than $1,000 per prospect, versus just a little over $200 with an exhibition lead. You read it right: Meeting a prospective customer at an exhibition versus in the field saves an organization $800 per customer. Also, there's a significant money savings when it comes to an exhibition's ability to save a company money when it comes to identifying a potential customer. <BR><BR>What does this mean to someone who is trying to decide if their company should continue to exhibit at tradeshows? It's relatively simple: Attendees are going to shows, and they're making big decisions because of them. Exhibitors who continue to exhibit during recessions save money – a lot of it. If you're not there, you're missing your audience, and you're having to spend up to five times MORE money meeting your prospects. Be glad to know that you’ve taken a step in the right direction with an exhibit at the 2010 CES. <BR><BR>Choosing to exhibit at a tradeshow isn't a frill; it's a necessity that undoubtedly contributes to a company's overall health in a time where strength is key. I hope this proves true with your marketing efforts at CES.<BR><BR><A href="/exhibitors/space/default.asp">Interested in exhibiting at CES?
