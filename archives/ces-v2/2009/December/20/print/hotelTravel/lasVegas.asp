</SPAN><SPAN style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px">We know traveling in this economy is tough, but there are ways to curb costs. In fact, attending CES is one of the smartest business trips you can make. Make it THE ONE business trip you make (rather than making several trips to different cities to meet with different decision makers).<BR><BR>Here are ways to get the best deal on airfare to the International CES:<BR><BR>
<OL type=1>
<LI><STRONG>Buy your ticket now.</STRONG> A 14-day advance used to be good enough, but with oil prices in such flux – with many speculating that the prices will only continue to rise – locking in airfare now is likely prudent. </LI>
<LI><STRONG>Travel midweek.</STRONG> Tuesdays through Thursdays are generally a less expensive times to fly, and lucky for you, the 2010 International show begins Thursday and ends Sunday (January 7-10). Consider staying the entire duration of the show to get the best airfare. Also, flights that depart very early or late in the day are often more affordable than mid-day flights. </LI>
<LI><STRONG>Shop around.</STRONG> If you are booking on a travel website, compare them against the official airline's website, too. Plus, travel sites don't feature every airline that flies into Las Vegas.</LI></OL></SPAN>

<div class="sponsorshipTitle">Getting Around: CES Foots the Bill</div>

While at CES, you have plenty to do, see and organize. So let us provide your transportation and give you one less thing to coordinate. The <A href="/print/hotelTravel/shuttle.asp">CES shuttle</A> runs daily during the show between the Las Vegas Convention Center and all official CES hotels. CES also provides discounts on <A href="/print/hotelTravel/cars.asp">car rentals</A>. <BR><BR>Please remember <A href="/print/hotelTravel/cars.asp">parking is very limited at CES</A> this year. Make your transportation choices wisely and let us be your chauffeur! <BR><BR>Other Las Vegas transportation options include: limos, taxis (fares range from $10-15 per trip), buses and private cars.

<div class="sponsorshipTitle">Vegas.com Tipping Tips</div>

Since Las Vegas is a service-based city, tipping is a big, big deal. Just ask the IRS. You may not be too sure how much to tip and when. So here's a quick rundown. 
<UL class=text>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Bellmen:</STRONG> They usually receive $1 a bag, but an extra tip is suggested if you use them to make show reservations, hail cabs or provide other additional assistance. </LI>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Taxi drivers:</STRONG> These folks drive like mad to get you where you're going, they help you with your bags, and provide a little chit-chat along the way. About 15 percent of your total fare should make up for their efforts. </LI>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Valet parking and maid service attendants:</STRONG> We suggest $1 to $2 each day. </LI>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Dealers:</STRONG> Tipping a dealer is a little trickier. You can give the dealer a tip in between hands or spins, and this tip can range from $1 to as much as you want to give. You also can wait until the end of your session and tip the dealer then. </LI>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Keno and bingo runners:</STRONG> $1 every few rounds is acceptable and suggested even if you aren't winning. </LI>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Cocktail waitresses:</STRONG> About $2 per round is sufficient for a small group (2-3 people). Increase for larger groups. Don't fail to tip, even if your drinks are comped. </LI>
<LI class=text><STRONG>Change person:</STRONG> Don't forget to slip a few bucks to these helpful folks — especially if you win. Don't try to palm off a $5 tip for a Megabucks win; it's insulting. </LI></UL>These are just suggestions — and you're always welcome to tip more! <BR><BR><B>CES quick tip: </B>Taking the <A href="/print/hotelTravel/shuttle.asp">CES shuttle</A> requires zero dollars. That includes no tipping!
