<br /><br />

Increased security makes&nbsp;airline travel&nbsp;a little more time consuming. According to most news reports and our own road warriors, the biggest lines are at ticket counters at the largest airports where customers are purchasing tickets, undergoing random baggage checks and checking luggage. Check with your travel agency, your selected airline or local airport about what to expect.<BR><BR><A href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/index.shtm" target=_blank>The Transportation Security Administration offers information on air travel security measures. </A><BR><BR>Purchase tickets ahead of time. You may be able to use e-tickets as long as you have proof of purchase, such as a printed confirmation, receipt or itinerary. Many airports have resumed curbside check-in. If you need to check luggage, allow yourself plenty of time. Carry valid photo identification. Prior to your flight, check with your airline or airport regarding recommended time to arrive at the airport. <BR><BR>Additionally, Bags to Go now services five major airlines, which means you can&nbsp;stay at CES longer and head to the airport later!&nbsp; If you are flying Delta, Frontier, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, or US Airways, Bags to Go is a convenient service that has been implemented at The Venetian, the Luxor hotel and the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC).&nbsp; Bags to Go enables you to check-in your luggage through to your final destination and also gives you the option of printing your boarding pass in advance.&nbsp; <BR><BR>To take advantage of this service you must check luggage three hours prior to your flight and have an e-ticket. All participating airlines charge a fee of $20 per person for this service. Southwest is the only participating airline that will allow each passenger to check&nbsp;two bags at no additional charge, other than the standard Bags to Go fee. All other airlines only allow&nbsp;one bag per person. Those checking more than&nbsp;one bag will be subject to additional fees. Please see your airline’s website for their baggage policies. <BR><BR>At The Venetian, Bags to Go is located on Level 1 of the meeting space, next to the Package Center.

<div class="sub-content-header">CES renews commitment to be world's largest environmentally friendly tradeshow</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><span class="smallText">Dec 16, 2009 03:56:27</span></i>

<br /><br />

The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has major plans to reduce the carbon footprint of the 2010 International CES through a partnership with EarthEra and the implementation of sustainable and energy efficient solutions. <BR><BR>"Every citizen must take personal responsibility for the environment, and the International CES must ensure we are doing more good than harm when it comes to the environment in general and carbon emissions specifically," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, CEA. "We estimate that CES saves attendees about a billion miles because they don't have to travel around the world for meetings. And to magnify our positive impact, we have creatively partnered to produce the world's largest environmentally sustainable trade event."<BR><BR>CEA is reducing its carbon footprint by partnering with EarthEra, the official Clean Energy Partner for the 2010 CES. EarthEra will issue green e-certified renewable energy certificates from their wind energy sources to offset electricity and carbon emissions affiliated with the International CES, including all show facilities and hotel rooms. <BR><BR>CEA has also donated $50,000 to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Convention Center Area Command, to purchase T-3 Motion electric vehicles and accessories. Electric police vehicles will reduce use of fossil fuel powered vehicles and help the environment, the police and the local community. <BR><BR>"The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is excited to partner with CEA in deploying “green” environmentally-friendly vehicles as part of our tourist corridor policing plan," said Capt. Charles Hank, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Convention Center Area Command. "We feel the addition of the electric vehicles funded by CEA will assist us in helping us strive to achieve our Vision – 'To be the safest community in America as well as the Safest Tourist destination in the World.'"<BR><BR>CES vendors and facilities are also adopting environmentally sustainable practices. The Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), which participates in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) WasteWise Program, will recycle exhibit hall and meeting room materials during all phases of show activity; The Venetian, which houses high-performance audio exhibits at this year's show, received silver-certification by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); Aramark, uses biodegradable utensils and napkins and purchases organic or locally sourced products; and GES runs 95 percent of all show contracting equipment on clean, natural gas and will install recycled carpet in CES areas such as registration, TechZones and CE Spotlights. <BR><BR>For more news about the greening of the 2010 International CES, visit <A href="http://www.CESweb.org/green">www.CESweb.org/green</A>.
