    <p><strong>Make the Most of CES with the CES Awards Program</strong><br> 
by Allison Burdine</p>
    <p>We are just 16 weeks away from CES, and the countdown is on. Labor Day generally marks the time when exhibitors like you crank into high gear and focus on figuring out the best way to pull together the best possible exhibit experience.<BR><BR>In this economy, standing out and truly being heard is crucial to succeed and boost sales. Because consumers are spending less and wanting more, every move you make matters. Companies have to strategize to make sure their products are the ones consumers want. Your average shoppers now constantly compare and judge products before they make a final purchase, and they are looking for products that stand out among the rest. <BR><BR>How can CES help in this environment? There are a variety of ways, but now’s the time to consider submitting entries in one of many <A href="/print/awards/default.asp" target=_blank>awards programs</A> hosted at CES.<BR><BR>Allow industry experts to review, critique, analyze and evaluate your products and projects and put consumers at ease by confirming your products are worthy of their trust and hard-earned income. Whether you are a product designer, engineer or a maverick in the television and advanced media arena, CES has an award to recognize you.<BR><BR>First up: Innovations. Since 1976, the <A href="/print/awards/innovations/default.asp" target=_blank>CES Innovations Design and Engineering Awards Program</A> recognizes the pinnacle of innovation in the consumer electronics industry. With entrants from 36 different product categories representing the hottest technologies in the CE industry, the CES Innovations Awards have become the hallmark of the best designed products in consumer technology. The 2010 Best of Innovations honorees will be announced at the New York Press Preview on November 10, 2009, at the Metropolitan Pavilion and showcased at the 2010 International CES.<BR><BR>Next, CNET has been an outstanding CEA partner through the years and will continue to produce the <A href="/print/awards/bestOfCES.asp" target=_blank>Best of CES Awards</A> program for 2010. The CNET Best of CES awards recognize the best new products at CES in nine categories. The competition is judged by CNET’s esteemed editorial team and also includes a Best of Show and People’s Voice award. Product entry review just started, so now’s the time to submit your entry.<BR><BR>The <A href="http://www.ce.org/Events/Awards/113.asp" target=_blank>Mark of Excellence Awards</A> program, presented by CEA's TechHome Division, recognizes the best in home electronics products, services, and installed technology. Each year, manufacturers, distributors, and systems integrators enter to compete in over 34 award categories for this coveted honor judged by independent experts. The Mark of Excellence Awards program culminates with the announcement of the winners at the Mark of Excellence Awards Dinner, held during the EHX (Electronic House Expo) Spring event in Orlando, Florida at the Orange County Convention Center. <A href="http://www.ce.org/Events/Awards/113.asp" target=_blank>Call for entries</A> starts December 7, 2009. Mark your calendar.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Ever dreamed of winning an Emmy? If you’re in the content technology arena, you just may make your dream come true. The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences now uses CES to host the&nbsp;<A href="/print/awards/techEmmys.asp" target=_blank>Emmy Awards for outstanding achievement in Engineering and Technical Development</A>. This will be the fourth consecutive year that the awards will be presented during the International CES. This awards program recognizes companies, individuals or scientific/technical organizations for advances in engineering technologies that improve reception, recording or transmission of television programming.&nbsp; The awards are presented during a special ceremony the opening night of the show. This year,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Board of Trustees of the NATAS is proud to honor and recognize the humanitarian efforts of Jerry Lewis who, since 1966, has masterfully used the medium of television during his annual MDA Labor Day Telethon to raise $1 billion for Muscular Dystrophy research and equipment. Jerry will be presented with the Academy’s most prestigious honor at the 61st annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards. Visit <A href="http://emmyonline.tv/tech/">http://emmyonline.tv/tech/</A> for more information on the awards. <BR><BR>Awards programs at CES are just one more way help your company stand out at the most important consumer technology event of the year. Mark your calendar for all of these now. They’re among the best press generators and credibility builders around.<BR></p>
