We've calculated your badge allotment for you. The following example illustrates the formula used to calculate the number of complimentary badges for use by your company based on the size of your exhibit space. The number of complimentary badges allocated appears within the online order system. If you have exceeded your badge allotment but need to register additional booth personnel, badges are available for purchase for $10 USD each.Total square feet of exhibit: 1000 sq. ft<BR>Divide by 100 square feet: /100 = 10<BR>Multiply by 5 complimentary badges&nbsp;(X5)<BR>Equals total complimentary badges: 50 badges

Attendees will not be admitted into CES without these two forms of I.D.<BR><BR>Children, friends and family who accompany you to Las Vegas will not be granted access to CES unless they are over the age of 16 and have proof of Industry affiliation.
