Be sure to pay close attention to discount deadline dates!

<div class="sub-content-header">Make Sure Your Booth is Approved</div>
<br />
Fire Marshal approval needs to be obtained every year, regardless of whether or not your booth design changes. Exhibitors on the show floor or in meeting rooms must obtain approval by the Fire Marshal by <STRONG>October 30</STRONG>, but it’s never too early to submit your floor plans for review as it often takes several drafts/alterations before getting 100 percent approved. This can be a lengthy process and waiting until the November 1 deadline to submit can result in a lot of unwanted stress.<BR><BR>If you have a floor plan ready for review or just have questions for the Fire Marshal as you begin designing your booth, please contact the appropriate office:<BR><BR>
