<LI>You can hire a non-official security company as long as they are licensed by Clark County and State of Nevada, and also permitted to work in the building. A list of non-official security companies is included in the security section of your manual. </LI>
<LI>A bona fide full time employee of the exhibiting company may be present in the booth for the purpose of providing security. This does not include part time employees, consultants or I&amp;D workers.<BR></LI></OL><br>
