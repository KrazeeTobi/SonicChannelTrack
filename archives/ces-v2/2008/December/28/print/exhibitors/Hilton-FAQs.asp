<div class="date-header">Booth Security</div>

<!--Should I order a guard for my booth?-->

<br><h4>Should I order a guard for my booth?</h4>
CES provides 24-hour hall and perimeter security only. It is strongly recommended that exhibitors hire guards and security cages to protect your displays and product at all times until outbound shipment is picked up. There are three options for hiring booth security:&nbsp; 
<OL type=1>
<LI>You can hire from one of the three official security companies: SOA, Protect or COP Security.</LI>
<LI>You can hire a non-official security company as long as they are licensed by Clark County and State of Nevada, and also permitted to work in the building. A list of non-official security companies is included in the security section of your manual. </LI>
<LI>A bona fide full-time employee of the exhibiting company may be present in the booth for the purpose of providing security. This does not include part time employees, consultants or I&amp;D workers. </LI></OL>Note: Whether you choose to hire from one of the official security companies or a non-official vendor, guard services quickly sell out in Las Vegas during CES. Place your orders as early as possible!<br>
