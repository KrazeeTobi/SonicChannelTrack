                        <H2>The World’s Coolest Trade Show is Working to Be the Greenest</H2>For more than 40 years, the International CES has been home to the largest display of consumer electronics products changing how we live, work and play. But did you know the show is working hard to make itself the largest certified carbon neutral trade event? <BR><BR>With the help of our partners, including GES, Aramark, the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) and the Sands Expo and Convention Center, CES attendees now have more opportunities than ever to recycle while conducting a year's worth of business in one prime, environmentally friendly location.<BR><BR>
