		Since I was born, I feel the Music inside of me, because my father was a Musician. At the age of 8 I build my first guitar amplifier, helped by an Audio Engineer, my first satisfaction was that this amplifier sounds. Since that time my life has been rounded by audio and video Technology. I grow up playing my guitar in different kind of music groups and dedicated to the professional audio. After that I have been working on the Audio business, first in the home systems, then in car audio and security systems. I was the fist one bringing the car audio's technology to M&amp;eacute;xico, it was great success for me and all the people that came after me. My work in that time was focused to the car audio because of the market's demand, but lately the development of new products and technologies guide me to open my action field to another applications like the Home Theatre and Mobile video. In the nearly years when I note that here in M&amp;eacute;xico was not exist any publication about Audio, Video, High End and Technologies for the mexican consumers, I decide to start with a very good friend Lic. Juan Marquez (&amp;#61574;) the project of STEREOMANIA Magazine, a publication dedicated to promote new technologies and innovations between the consumers here in Mexico . I think that more than 30 years in this business and more than 25 years attending to CES have bring me the experience to keep going with technology day by day. I know the CES is my strongest tool to go ahead.<br>
