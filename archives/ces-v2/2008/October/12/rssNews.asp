<div class="sub-content-header">Go Easy On Your Wallet, Be Smart When Booking Airfare</div>

<br /><br />

We know the economy has impacted everybody’s wallet, but when it comes to booking airfare to CES, there are ways to save. Choosing CES as your one consumer technology tradeshow is — for starters — a great way to save money. Rather than traveling to multiple cities around the globe to conduct business, CES could be THE ONE trip you make, connecting you with more than 130,000 consumer technology professionals and more than 2,700 exhibitors from 140 different countries.<BR><BR>Here are ways to get the best deal on airfare to the International CES: 
<UL>
<LI><IMG height=125 src="/images/photos/travel_03.jpg" width=165 align=right>Buy your ticket now. A 14-day advance purchase used to be good enough, but with oil prices in such flux – with many speculating that the prices will only continue to rise – locking in airfare now is likely prudent. </LI>
<LI>Travel midweek. Tuesdays through Thursdays are generally less expensive times to fly, and lucky for you, the 2009 International show begins Thursday and ends Sunday (January 8-11). Consider staying the entire duration of the show to get the best airfare. </LI>
<LI>Shop around. If you are booking on a travel website, sanity check the rates by visiting the airline’s website, too. Plus, travel sites don’t feature every airline that flies into Las Vegas. </LI>
<LI>Check out <A href="http://www.mccarran.com/" target=_blank>McCarran International Airport’s site</A> for information on which airlines service the airport, flight information, local transportation and more.</LI></UL>
