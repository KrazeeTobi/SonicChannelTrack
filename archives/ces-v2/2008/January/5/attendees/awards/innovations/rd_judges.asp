		An industrial designer and entrepreneur, Stuart Karten subscribes to the belief that creativity is at the core of innovation. The recipient of numerous patents and design awards and national and international recognition by the design press, his talent lies in his ability to transcend the predictable. Grounded in traditional design skills, his success is directly attributed to his design philosophy: a blend of endless curiosity, creative anarchy and old-fashioned common sense. Since launching his Los Angeles-based industrial design consulting firm in 1984, Stuart and his team of research, design and engineering specialists have established a reputation for digging deep to find innovative solutions across a broad spectrum of programs, from medical instrumentation to automotive trend and materials analysis, and consumer electronics to toys. The firm's research-driven design process, ModeMapping&amp;trade;, has received international attention, including a 2006 IDEA Silver Award. Prior to opening his own design firm, Stuart, a Rhode Island School of Design graduate, worked for Southern California corporations including Mattel, Gould and Baxter Medical products.<br>

		From the time I was born, I’ve felt the music inside of me, because my father was a musician. At the age of 8, I built my first guitar amplifier with the help of an audio engineer. Since that time, my life has been surrounded by audio and video technology. I grew up playing my guitar in different kinds of music groups and dedicated myself to the world of professional audio. I began working in the audio business -- first in home systems, then in car audio and security systems. I was the first to bring car audio technology to Mexico, which was a great success. I then focused on home theatre and mobile video technologies. With the help of a good friend, Lic. Juan Marquez, I launched STEREOMANIA Magazine, a publication dedicated to bringing new technologies and innovation to the Mexican consumers.
