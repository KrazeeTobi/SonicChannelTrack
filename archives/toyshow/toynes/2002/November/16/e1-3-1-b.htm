<H3>(2) Some special features for the hearing-impaired:</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hearing-impaired, as opposed to the sight-impaired, can play with any soundless toys with no problem.<BR>
  However, any other toys than those producing no sound have to be paid careful attention to during the development of the toys in order to be enjoyed by both normal and hard-hearing people.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BR>
<B>[Major points to be considered] </B><BR>
<P>
Some points to be considered about co-playable toys which can be enjoyed with the hearing-impaired are now under internal discussion and scheduled to be published in the guidelines for fiscal 1996.<BR>
  However, please consult with the secretariat of The Japan Toy Association,
 if you have any interest in or questions about the toys in the following categories:<BR>
<P>
<B>1. Toys designed for pleasant communication:</B><BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is very important for children to enjoy playing together with their friends.<BR>
 However, hearing-impaired children sometimes have difficulty when they cannot communicate smoothly while playing with games or toys which employ sounds and voices with their playmates.<BR>
<P>
On these occasions, if they exchange signals using communication methods other than sound or voice, they will be able to enjoy playing pleasantly together in a group.<BR>
  And in order to enjoy the communication itself with each other,
 a board on which they can write letters or words for conversation by writing or a letter telephone through
 which they can exchange letters mutually from a distance are of great value for promotion of enjoyable communication among the hearing-impaied.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>2. Toys with other methods of stimulation like light, vibration, movement, letters, pictures, etc. other than sound:</B><BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>having adjustable sound functions from the highest to the lowest volume;<BR>
