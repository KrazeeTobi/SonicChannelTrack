  Mibu is a Toy Town (Omocha-no-machi).
  Toy Town is the name of the station as well as the address.
  It was named so because there is a well-known toy industrial park in the town.
  This museum was established in order to further activate the town with the toy industry and also foster children's dreams.<BR>
<P>
  The museum has three floors.
  The first floor is the toy wonderland, equipped with various devices with which children can actually play and experience.<BR>
<P>
  The second floor is the display area of about 2,000 toy items classified by theme.
  It has also a touch-and-play corner.
  The third floor is an observatory with a 360 panoramic view, where you can take a rest.
  Mibu Toy MUseum gives dreams to children, and nostalgia to the grown-ups.
  All the staffs are looking foward to welcoming you at the museum.<BR>
