<P>
After receiving advice from the small-bump recommendation subcommittee,
 if you present an application letter to the small-bumps secretariat of The Japan Toy Association,
 you may receive the above-illustrated seeing eye dog emblems to use on packages and catalogues for your products.<BR>
 Please contact the secretariat if you would like to receive the above-illustrated rabbit emblems.<BR>
<P>
As can be seen from the above, we have prepared two designs each for both the seeing-eye dog and the rabbit emblems.<BR>
<P>
type A has an illustration only.<BR>
<P>
type B has words of explanation beside the illustration.<BR>
