ST Mark: Symbol of Assurance<BR></CENTER>
<P>
Children's life is play in itself.
  And the toys and dolls make their play richer and merrilier.
  The toys and dolls, therefore, need to be strong, safe and useful for the mental and physical evelopment of children.
  Above all, safety is the most important aspect.<BR>
<P>
For this reason, the toy industry has set up "safety standard for toys" after consulting with government officials, men of learning and the representatives of consumers.<BR>
<P>
This standard is stricter than any other standard in American and European continents, and the toys which conform the safety requirements specified in this standard are attached S.T. Mark (S.T. stands for safe toy).
  The toys with ST Mark mean that the toy industry guarantees that "the toys are carefully manufactured so that they can be used safely".<BR>
<P>
Since ST numbers are linked with JAN code (bar code number), various analysis are being made based on POS data of retailers using toy industry VAN "TOYNES" which is operated by our association.
  And new possibility is expanding.<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<B>Background</B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The biggest responsibility imposed on every industrialist is to ensure safety of their products and to improve it.
  The Consumer Protection Fundamental Law ( Law No. 78, 1968 ) specifies that a manufacturer shall take a necessary measure to prevent the hazard relating to the products he supplies.
  He is also responsible for cooperating with the policies of the state and local governments set down for the protection of consumers.
  Further, he shall improve the quality and other features of his products and endeavour for the proper handling of complaints from consumers.<BR>
<P>
Especially when the toys are concerned, the assurance of safety is a major problem since the toys are indispensable for the growth of children.
  Some toy-related accidents were reported to have caused serious injury to the body or threatened life of children due to the structural defects or through the misuse of products.
  In addition, most of the accidents were reported to have been caused by the lack of proper warning given to the children on its use.<BR>
<P>
Under such circumstances, a Toy Safety Measures Committee consisting of experts from all relative fields was set up in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in 1969, which discussed deliberately over how to proceed with the safety policies.
  As a result of deliberation, a report was presented on April 10th, 1971, which states that the appropriate way to set forward safety policies for the time being was voluntary regulation participated by the third parties.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
With this report, the Japan Toy Association (JTA) determined to launch a voluntary regulation scheme from October the same year, marking the first epoch-making step with respect to the assurance of safety.<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Issurance of ST Mark (ST stands for safe toy)</H3>
<P>
Those who wish to attach ST mark to their products may do so by taking the following procedures.<BR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="a">）The producer who belongs to one of the member associations of the Japan Toy Association (the J.T.A.) must conclude a contract with the J.T.A. for the use of the ST mark through the association he belongs.<BR>
<P>
Those producers who do not belong to the member associations of the J.T.A. have to conclude the contract directly with the J.T.A.<BR>
<P>
<LI>）The producer who completed to conclude the contract for every product he wish to attach the ST mark on may apply for inspection directly to the inspecting organization.<BR>
<P>
When the product pass the inspection, the inspection organization issues a notice of conformity to the applicant.<BR>
<P>
After this, the passing number of the inspected product is issued and the applicant may attach ST mark on their products.<BR>
<P>
<LI>）The producer is required to keep the quality of the products on which the ST mark is attached to the same level as that of the inspected product by the contract.<BR>
<P>
When he violates this requirement, he will be punished by the ban on the use of ST mark, a penalty of five million yen at the maximum and so on.<BR>
</OL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>For Further Safety</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI TYPE="a">）Material Registration System<BR>
<P>
In order to secure the quality of the toys bearing the ST mark, the plastic resin industry is conducting the preliminary testing on the toy materials for which the hygiene testing is required,
 such as various synthetic resin materials, ink and paint, and they register and publish the names of the materials that have passed the testing as safe materials.<BR>
The industry is encouraging toy firms to use the registered materials.<BR>
<P>
<LI>）Toy Accident Compensation Mutual Aid System<BR>
<P>
A contractor of ST mark shall contribute a certain amount of money to the Mutual Aid Fund, which is reserved for the purpose of compensating the victims of damages caused by the ST mark-bearing toys.<BR>
Even if a toy accident is occurred, a contractor is able to take necessary and sufficient measures with this fund to compensate the damages caused by the accident, and the interests of consumers are, thus, protected properly.<BR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>)Principle to deal with the toy accident<BR>
<P>
 In principle, the accident shall be dealt with the contractor who is the related party to
the accident.
 He must show sincerity for the peaceful solution of the matter.
 All the related organs of the Mutual Aid System (Compensation Committee and others;
Mutual Aid offices are the same as the ST-mark Management offices ) will cooperate
with the contractor for the prompt and peaceful settlement of the case.<BR>
<P>
<LI>)Amount to be Compensated<BR>
<P>
 The amount to be compensated by this system is the same level as that established
by the Victims Relief System of SG mark.
 (Maximum compensation will be 10,000,000 yen per person and maximum money of sympathy
will be 300,000 yen per person).<BR>
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The amount of compensation is determined by applying the standards specified in the Automobile Accident Compensation Security Act, but, the amount of the money of sympathy is determined case by case.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Toy Safety Mark System & PL Law</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to cope with the PL law which was implemented on July 1st, 1995, the J.T.A. established a PL Committee in the last fiscal year for the review of the issues relating to the law.<BR>
 As a result, the conventional Toy Accident Compensation Mutual Aid System has been expanded.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
