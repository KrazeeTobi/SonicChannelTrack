<B>Welcome to the Toy Library.
 Thank you for accessing the Japan Toy Association homepage.<BR></B></CENTER>

 As we approach the 21st. century, i.e., the multimedia age, more and more information such as pictures,
 voices and words are being exchanged in digitized form.
 Multimedia has given us a glimpse of the future, and digital technology has given rise to a completely new way of thinking and has set new standards.
 Furthermore, unlike any technological boom we've experienced in the past, the multimedia boom has spread not only among industry specialists and enthusiasts, but has spread further to include the general public.
 People seem to have realized the potential of multimedia, on how it can change the social, economic and educational aspects of their lives.
 We believe toys too, should undergo a change to suit the social environment.<BR>
<P>
Here, the Japan Toy Association has gathered various information related to toys.
 Please feel free to browse through our Toy Library, as we'll keep you updated with the latest developments.
 In addition, we will continuously be incorporating new features to this service, including on-line shopping.<BR>
<P>
In order for us to better serve you, we'd love to hear your comments and suggestions.<BR>
