The following "small-bumps" public relations activities campaign is promoted mainly by various subcommittees<BR>
<P>
<H3>1. Publication of "Toy catalogue":</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In June every year a "co-playable toy catalogue for the hearing- and/or sight-impaired" is published,
 incorporating both Braille and print, and is distributed free to schools for the blind,
 Braille libraries and various welfare-related facilities nationwide.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>2. Exhibitions at The Tokyo Toy Show:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many products listed in the above-mentioned toy catalogue are demonstrated at the booth of the Tokyo Toy Show at Makuhari Messe in June every year.
The Small Bump Committee has been endeavoring to gain a deeper understanding of these activities among not only the people in the toy industry, but also the general public in Japan.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>3. Toy Trade Fair Exhibitions to be held in autumn:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the autumn Toy Trade Fair to be held at six locations in Japan in September every year,
 exhibitions in booths are given thanks to the cooperation of the secretariat at each trade fair as a part of the public relations activities for the people living in local areas in Japan.<BR>
<P> 
The Toy Trade Fair is an exhibition for the people in the toy industry,
 but offers a good chance for the general public to learn more about these activities as many reporters visit the Fair each time and provide information through the massmedia.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>4. Exhibitions to booths in compliance with requests from various welfare-related organizations</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beside many exhibitions within the toy industry as mentioned above, we have a principle of responding helpfully, case by case,
 in lending toys or dispatching staff to give good explanations, etc. after receiving approval from the Small Bump Committee
 when we have been requested to exhibit some products in trade fairs sponsored by welfare organizations which have relations with people who are sight- or hearing-impaired.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>5. Information through PC communication:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Via the "toy information" which the Small Bump Committee has been offering through NIFTY-Serve, we have been giving small-bump information to introduce the contents of our activities.<BR>
 The main contents of this information are:<BR>
<P>
