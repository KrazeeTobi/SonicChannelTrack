With the <B>"small-bumps" proposal</B>,
 the Japan Toy Association is promoting diffusion of as many co-playable toys as possible which were designed and manufactured with special features enabling children and adults who are hearing- or sight-impaired to play together with those who are not,
 as a way of returning profits from the Japanese toy industry in general to society,
 in cooperation with various welfare related organizations headed by the Japan Braille Library.<BR>
<P>
The word "features" mentioned here, means a special device with "small-bumps",
 written on the part of a product which indicates that the product can be used by sight-impaired people,
 in the same way that a "small-bumps" device is attached to button No.5 of a push-button type telephone.<BR>
<P>
The "small-bumps" name is derived from the fact that button No.5 of the telephone machine has a small bump.
 In February 1990, with a view to promoting this "small-bumps" campaign widely inside and outside the toy industry,
 the "Small Bumps Committee" was established by the Japan Toy Association to carry out the following activities:<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> To encourage people working in the toy industry to manufacture toys which can be enjoyed by anyone who is hearing-impaired with special consideration of possible categories among many kinds of toys and games to be developed and sold in the future,
 so that as many people as possible can enjoy them.<BR>
<P>
<LI> To give users and various welfare-related organizations information on co-playable games and toys.<BR>
<P>
<LI> To promote public relations activities on the contents of its small-bumps actvities to people inside and outside the toy industry.<BR>
</OL>
<P>
<BR>
In addition, we named toys to be manufactured with special features for the sight-impaired as co-playable toys for both normal and handicapped people and printed a Labrador Retriever emblem,
 a popular seeing-eye dog, on the surface of the toy packages.<BR>
 This emblem was recognized internationally at the conference of the International Council of the Toy Industries (abbreviated as ICTI),
 which consists of 14 countries worldwide,
 held in Australia in 1992 and a campaign to promote co-playable toys for both normal and handi-capped people began in the countries such as USA, the U.K. and Sweden in 1993.<BR>
<P>
We have been informed by toy associations in Taiwan, Canada and Australia that they are also in the process of study or preparation of the small-bumps campaign activities.<BR>
<P>
And in 1992, as the second stage of this campaign,
 research and development of toys to be manufactured with special features for the hearing-impaired also began and a rabbit emblem began to be shown on toy packages to be manufactured with special features these children,
 as in case of co-playable toys for both normal people and the sight-impaired.<BR>
