  Japan Toys Museum was founded on September 1, 1981.
  Japanese toys are excellent in ideas, materials, safety and in hygiene, and have been exported to all over the world.
  However, the toys are such products that are firstly played by children, but secondly thrown to a toy box, and finally put to a transh can.
  For such destiny of toy products, there have been no place in Japan till now where toys were displayed systematically.<BR>
<P>
  At this museum, toys which were manufactured in the factory for the purpose of sale and traded domestically or internationally are displayed chronologically and by category.
  About 8,000 items out of 13,000 stocks are waiting for you just as they were in the past days.<BR>
