<p align="center"><b class="headline">Remarks of<br>
Douglas Lowenstein, President,<br>
Interactive Digital Software Association<br>
at the Electronic Entertainment Exposition<br>
May 17, 2001</b></p>

<p>Good morning.  Unfortunately, we tried to get that little girl who was on her father's shoulders to speak here instead of me, but she was booked.  So here I am.</p>  

<p>Anyway, welcome to the seventh annual Electronic Entertainment Expo.  As we stand poised to open the world's premier showcase for interactive entertainment, I can tell you that the state of the industry is very strong.  Indeed, the future for video games is one of unparalleled growth, limitless creative advances, and eventual leadership as the most important form of entertainment in the 21st Century.</p> 

<p>Seven years ago, when we held the first E3 here in Los Angeles, it was a critical time for the industry.  We were emerging from a brutal few years marked by the transition from the dominant video game console platforms of the time, the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, to next generation hardware that promised new, unmatched interactive entertainment experiences.  A major new global consumer electronics giant, Sony, was entering the market.  The PC was on the cusp of becoming a mainstream game machine with the emergence of CD-ROMs.  An entirely new and untested game platform - the Internet -- was emerging from the obscurity of academic backwaters.  And politicians in Washington had begun to set their sights on the issue of video game violence.</p>

<p>Since then, we've seen tremendous change and evolution in our business, both in the technologically we depend on, and the creative boundaries pushed by game developers the world over.  But there are some parallels between 1995 and E3 2001.</p>  

<p>For as we gather here today, we're coming out of yet another difficult transition year between old and new technology; more new hardware systems are being launched; we have another new major global power entering the market; we're seeing the emergence of DVDs for the PC; more new platforms are emerging as wireless games take root; and, of course, politicians are still grumbling about video game violence.</p>  

<p>So what is new and different in May, 2001?  Plenty.</p>   

<p>Seven years ago video games were played mostly by teenage boys, usually in the basement or the bedroom.  No longer.  Today, video games are mainstream entertainment: they're played by people of all ages; they're played by people of all tastes; and they've become as important a part of our culture as television and movies.  As journalist Ted Fishman said writing in the March issue of Worth Magazine, &quot;For investors, for businesses, and even for national economies, video games aren't child's play.  They are becoming a dominant medium.&quot;</p>

<p>But there's more.  Video games are no longer just relegated to a corner of the house, as they once were.  They're in the center of the home, they're on the Internet, they're in the movies, they're in the schools, they're on cell phones; they're on PDAs and airplanes; and they're even in medical research labs.  In short, video games are everywhere.</p>       

<p>Let's start with the home, for this is where most games are still played.  According to many analysts, the new game consoles launched here at E3 will eventually be in more American households than any previous generation of game machines.  In fact, last year, Forrester Research forecast that by 2005 video game consoles would be in nearly 70 million American households.  This is not the 90% penetration level achieved by VCRs. . . yet.  However, the 70% level would make this generation of video game consoles one of the most successful consumer electronic products in history.</p>  

<p>And what this means for the future of the entertainment software industry is, quite simply, booming sales.  According to a new report from the research firm IDC, computer and video game sales will reach an astonishing $16.9 billion by 2003, not including an estimated $1.1 billion from on line game revenue.  Some analysts would regard this as an extremely optimistic number.  But even if the actual number is only two-thirds of the IDC estimate, it suggests that game industry software revenue will soon, once and for all, leave the motion picture box office behind for good.</p>   

<p>One explanation for such bullish forecasts is demographic.  A recent analysis by Deutsche Bank, Alex Brown found that the target population for the video game industry in 1980 numbered twenty million; today, it is 96 million, and by 2005 it will be 119 million.  In other words, there are a lot of current and potential gamers out there, and the new console systems, with their enormously highly quality graphics and multi functional capabilities, add tens of millions of new players to the gaming population.</p>      

<p>I've been talking about projections the last few minutes.  Let's look at the video game market now.  According to an IDSA report on the economic impact of video games on the US economy, sales in video games have been growing at an annual rate of 15% a year over the last several years, double the rate of growth of the US economy as a whole, and far outpacing the growth in other entertainment and technology industries.   For example, growth in the film production and distribution business has averaged about 5% a year and growth in the computer hardware business has averaged four percent a year.  In other words, video games are a big and bright spot in the high tech economy, and one of the only sectors that has done well over the last six months.</p>      

<p>I mentioned earlier that game consoles used to be confined to distant corners of the home.  But IDSA's 2001 consumer research, which we're releasing this morning, shows that nearly three-fifths of all console units are now located in either family rooms or living rooms.  This is significant, for it means that video game consoles occupy a very central place in the home entertainment complex.</p>  

<p>The popularity of games played at home can also be measured by the fact that Americans report that playing games, either online or from the desktop, is the most popular use of the PC in the home.  According to IDSA's research, the PC is used 31% of the time to play games, surpassing email, which ranks second at 21%.</p>  

<p>Now it's long been thought by those who don't follow the industry closely that most gamers are teenage boys.  Please, please, can we put that stereotype to rest once and for all.  The fact is, not only are games everywhere, but gamers are everyone.  For starters, most aren't teenagers.  We found that 70% of the most frequent PC gamers are 18 and over, and 57% of the most frequent console players are over 18; a remarkable 40% of PC gamers are over 35; as to gender, 39% of the most frequent users of the PC for games are women, and 26% of the most frequent console gamers are women.</p>  

<p>Furthermore, gamers come from all walks of life.  Our survey found that nearly ten percent of the most frequent users are homemakers, 8% are executives/professionals, about seven percent are computer scientists or engineers, and 8% are clerical workers.   There are lawyers, teachers, social workers, and others.  More than three-fifths had some college education.</p>  
   
<p>Add this to the profile of the game industry: most homes are multiple gamer households.  In fact, the average number of persons per household who play games ranges from 2 for the console to nearly 2 ½ for the PC.  And those who play most frequently are playing longer, reporting that they used their PCs for games nearly 11 hours per week in 2001 compared to just over 10 hours per week in 2000 while the most frequent users of consoles report a smaller increase, from 9.7 hours per week to 10 hours per week.  What's this mean for other entertainment?  Thirty-six percent of the most frequent gamers say they're watching TV less due to the appeal of video games.</p>   

<p>All these numbers help us understand the audience for video games better.  But the one figure which matters most is this: when Americans were asked which entertainment activity they find to be the most fun, 34% said video games, more than double such activities as watching TV, surfing the Internet, and going to the movies.  Even more striking, and important for the future of the industry, 57% of those who play games most frequently report that they're more fun than any other entertainment activity, with TV a very distant second at 13%.  These are the consumers who will be making the entertainment choices of the future, and they've already cast their chads with video games.</p>   

<p>Fun.  That's what this show is about, and our industry, too.  That three-letter word also helps explain why games are migrating throughout our society, why they are, indeed, ubiquitous.  Our research found that 32% of Americans say they play games from time to time with handheld game systems, 5% say they play games on their personal digital assistants, and 11 percent are playing games on their cell phones.</p>  

<p>One place where gaming is growing rapidly is the Internet.  Late last year, IDC Research released a report estimating that about 40 million Americans play online games today, and 72 million will play online games by 2004.  IDC estimates that revenue from online games will hit $2.3 billion by 2005.  According to a recent report by Deutsche Bank Alex, Brown, interactive entertainment sites were the fastest growing sites on the Web in 2000, and in March 2001, roughly one-half of all US Internet users spent time playing games.</p>  

<p>IDSA's consumer survey picked up similar trends.  We saw the percentage of the most frequent gamers who play online grow from 19% in 2000 to 24% in 2001.  We also found a significant and important shift in how people access the Internet, with a strong increase in the numbers connecting through high-speed DSL and cable modems.  Analysts predict broadband penetration will reach 25% of US homes over the next five years.  This surge in high-speed access bodes well for the future of Internet games as faster connections mean that game designers will be able to deliver richer game experiences to users, and the entire on line game experience will itself be more compelling.</p>  

<p>Games are not just limited to the living room, the desktop, or cyberspace.  They're also emerging on wireless platforms.</p>  

<p>Cell phones are becoming perhaps the most omnipresent communication appliance in the world today; half a billion phones are sold annually worldwide!  Data Monitor forecasts that 198 million people in Western Europe and America will be playing games on their phones by 2004.  Nokia estimates that mobile gaming will generate $6 billion revenue worldwide by 2005.  Like with the forecasts for video game revenue, I can't tell you this potential will be fully realized.  But clearly, there are some big time companies betting a lot of money on development of a vibrant video game market for wireless devices.</p>    
	
<p>In Japan, cell phone gaming is already huge and NTT is planning on rolling out its DoCoMo I Mode service in Europe; global telecommunications power houses like Nokia, Ericcson and Siemans are rushing to make content deals with leading game companies like Eidos and THQ.  With the eventual rollout of 3G high-speed wireless Internet access, cell phone games may become even more viable.</p>    

<p>We're also seeing games emerge as a hot application for PDA's.  In fact, games are among the most popular downloads for Palm Pilots.  And just a few weeks ago, British Airways announced that it will make games available on some of its in-flight entertainment systems.  BA's entry into gaming in the skies means that an estimated 20 million passengers will be able to play video games on 245 planes flying around the globe.</p>    

<p>It's not just the home, the Internet, the wireless world, and the friendly skies where games are becoming more visible.</p>  

<p>Here's a recent story from the Virginian Pilot in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

<p>&quot;Third-grader Dan Hasas plops on an easy chair in front of the television and reaches for the controls of his Sony PlayStation.  In months past, his mother probably would have told him to do his homework first. But in Dan's living room -- and hundreds of others across the city -- homework and PlayStation have become one and the same.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan's school, Willard Model Elementary, is one of 16 Norfolk schools that is working with Lightspan Inc. to use video games as a learning tool.   Thomas Lockamy, Norfolk's deputy superintendent of academic affairs explained why the school turned to video games.  &quot;We were looking for a program that was not the same old duplication of workbooks and teacher-directed remediation kind of program, and this answered the charge.&quot;  Lightspan systems are in use in 1,600 schools in 43 states and early evidence is that they result in improved academic achievement in vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and math problem solving.</p>   

<p>The Lightspan product is highly customized.  But there is no question that there are also great opportunities to use off the shelf video games to help kids learn.  In fact, as educators look to find ways to teach and engage an increasingly technologically literate student, and as a new generation of teachers more comfortable with technology enter the classroom, it's just a matter of time before more and more games will be used as teaching tools.  Age of Empires could be used to bring the Middle Ages to life; SimCity illustrates basic government and urban planning; games like Roller Coaster Tycoon can be used to teach basic principles of physics and economics.</p>    

<p>Games and game technology are also finding a place in medical laboratories to treat diseases and other conditions.  Larry Hodges, a professor and computer scientist at Georgia Tech, is using video game and virtual reality technology to treat Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress syndrome.</p> 

<p>&quot;One Vietnam Veteran was a tank commander,&quot; Hodges explained.  &quot;His most traumatic event involved his tank being overrun by North Vietnamese regulars. Everyone in his tank battalion was killed except him.  He was left for dead with his jaw broken.&quot;  Hodges will use VR technology to create a virtual environment to recreate the experience of being in Vietnam, and the veteran will retell, and relive, the story of the tank being overrun.</p> 

<p>Skip Rizzo, a psychologist and cognitive rehabilitation specialist at USC here in LA, is incorporating gaming features into virtual environments to treat people with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease, and even attention deficit disorders.  He reports that video games like SimCity are extremely useful for enhancing patients' executive functions.</p>  

<p>And Dorothy Strickland, President of Do2Learn, is using video games to work with autistic children, teaching them simple skills like how to use a computer mouse.</p>  

<p>Dorothy's work, and the work of others using game technology and principles for non-commercial uses, are being showcased at E3 in the Beyond Play Pavilion in the South Hall.  Stop by there during the show.  It's inspiring and exciting.</p>       

<p>And let's not overlook video games in the military.  We've heard a lot about this subject over the last few years, but much of what's been written has been inaccurate.  That's unfortunate, because there is no question that video games are providing cost effective and advanced tools to help our military prepare for future conflicts.  For example, at Ft. Bragg, NC, up to 50 soldiers trained on a new high tech weapons system called Land Warrior.  And they relied on a customized version of a video game, Delta Force 2, as a training aid to simulate the actual weapon system's capabilities.</p>  

<p>Ok, to sum up: we have games in the home, on the Internet, on wireless devices, in schools, in laboratories, and the military.  But if you're still not convinced that games are, indeed, everywhere, perhaps this will put your skepticism to rest.</p>  

<p>In the weeks prior to his inauguration, several profiles of President Bush said that among his favorite leisure time activities is playing video games.  Has gaming infiltrated the White House?  Is President Bush a closet gamer?  I leave that to the press to ferret out.  And we've also heard on good authority that former First Lady and now Senator Hillary Clinton used a GameBoy to pass the time on the campaign trail.</p>  
  
<p>And if you still don't believe that video games are everywhere, I'll offer this piece of definitive evidence.</p>  

<p>Proctor and Gamble recently launched a dandruff-fighting Web game for its Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.  The game features &quot;Capitan Cool,&quot; who fights menacing dandruff flakes with bottles of Head &amp; Shoulders through levels of increasing difficulty.  You can even e mail a copy of the dandruff game to friends and loved ones.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, case closed.</p>   

<p>When I spoke here last year, I talked of how changing demographics bode well for the video game industry.  The generations between 12-35 have grown up with interactivity; it is as natural to them as radio was to an earlier generation.  We've entered an era where interactive entertainment will become dominant, where there will be numerous outlets for people to indulge their innate desire to control and interact with their environments.  And video games will be the beneficiary.</p>  

<p>Last weekend, journalist Bob Schwabach, writing in the Arts and Leisure Section of the New York Times, said that &quot;The video game industry has been on the threshold of seizing dominance in entertainment for several years.  Ultimately, it will.  It's inevitable: we play games.  . . There is a fundamental difference between movies and video games: the games are interactive, movies are passive.  I don't see any way out of this.&quot;</p>     
 
<p>Neither do I.  For the game industry, it should only get better over the next five years.  Video games bring us into imaginary worlds and allow us to define who we are, how we behave, and how we relate to others in the game; they challenge us intellectually; they excite us; they educate us.  Above all else, though, what makes video games unique among all other forms of entertainment is that they are interactive.  They empower us to shape our experience and to control the outcome.  And, oh yes,  they're fun.  And  E3 is ground zero for the future of entertainment.  So go ahead, as you walk the show floor, and touch the future of entertainment.</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
