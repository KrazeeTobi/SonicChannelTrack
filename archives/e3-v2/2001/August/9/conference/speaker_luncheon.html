<p>Imagine yourself spending an hour over lunch with one of the game industry's brightest stars? During our special Speaker's Roundtable Luncheon, a small group of randomly selected Super Pass holders will have just that opportunity. Be our guest along with five other Super Pass holders invited to lunch with one of our workshop or conference session speakers. Depending on who you are seated with, you'll be invited to discuss the future of gaming, up and coming technologies, new hardware configurations, or any subject you're inclined to talk about.</p>

<p><img src="../images/photos/photo_open_floor.jpg" width="196" height="147" alt="The Expo Floor" border="0" align="right">One of last year's attendee shared this thought: &quot;The opportunity to meet with a developer I had only previously read about was awe-inspiring. There's nothing like sitting in a room full of people who have the greatest impact on what future games will be like and sharing your ideas. The experience was fantastic.&quot;</p>

<p>Be among the ninety pre-registrants purchasing a Super Pass who will be randomly selected to join a host speaker during our luncheon on Wednesday, May 16 at 12:30 p.m. All selected attendees will be contacted to confirm their participation and their choice of host speaker (on a first come-first served basis) by April 13th.</p>

<p>Good luck! We look forward to counting you among the lucky Super Pass holders chosen to join us for our special Speaker's Roundtable Luncheon!</p>

<p><b class="redbold">Dr. Paul Debevec</b><br>	
Executive Producer, Graphics Research<br>	
<i>USC Institute for Creative Technologies</i><br><br>	

Paul Debevec earned degrees in Math and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1992 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Berkeley in 1996. Debevec's Ph.D. thesis presented an interactive method for modeling architectural scenes from photographs and rendering these scenes using projective texture-mapping. With this he led the creation of a photorealistic model of the Berkeley campus for his 1997 film The Campanile Movie whose techniques were later used to create the Academy Award-winning virtual backgrounds for the "bullet time" shots in the 1999 film The Matrix. Since his Ph.D. Debevec has worked on techniques for capturing real-world illumination and illuminating synthetic objects with real light, facilitating the realistic integration of real and computer generated imagery. His 1999 film Fiat Lux placed towering monoliths and gleaming spheres into a photorealistic reconstruction of St. Peter's Basilica, all illuminated by the light that was actually there. For real objects, Debevec has worked on developing the Light Stage, a device that allows objects and actors to be synthetically illuminated with any form of lighting. Debevec works at the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies, where he directs research in virtual actors, virtual environments, and applying computer graphics to creative projects.</p>
