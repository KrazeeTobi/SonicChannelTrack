<p><b>REMARKS OF DOUGLAS LOWENSTEIN, PRESIDENT, INTERACTIVE DIGITAL SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION, AT E<sup>3</sup> MEDIA BRIEFING</b></p>

<p>Good Morning, and welcome to the 9th annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, better known as E<sup>3</sup>.

<p>Over the next half hour or so, I am going to touch on a series of topics, including the state of the game industry today, industry demographics, trends in game content, copyright bills and video game violence regulation, and even examples of the use of games outside the living room. Now, you might wonder how are these topics related? Actually, in writing these remarks, I wondered myself. But as I thought about each of them I realized there is a connection, and by the time I am finished, I hope you'll see them as clearly as I do.</p>

<p>What links these together is the word innovation. The dictionary defines innovation as the act or process of inventing or introducing something new. And that is the key to the future of this industry.</p>

<p>Take each topic I mentioned a moment ago: Innovation is the key to whether and by how much the industry grows in coming years; Innovation is the key to whether we continue to broaden our reach to new, still largely untapped consumers, and maintain a hold on current gamers; Innovation is the key to whether we grow as an art form; Changes in copyright laws and anti-video game regulation both have the potential to dampen incentives to innovate; Finally, the innovative use of games outside the living room offers exciting ways that the technology we develop can be used to advance larger societal goals beyond entertainment.</p>

<p>So at various points in these remarks, you'll hear me return to this theme of innovation because I believe it captures so much of what's relevant to what happens in our industry over the next decade.</p>

<p>Let's start with a look at the state of the industry in May, 2003. All signs point to another year of solid growth in 2003. While first quarter numbers showed total PC and console software sales about even with 2002 numbers, that's not surprising at this time of year. And an informal survey of major retailers revealed that they remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the balance of the year, with most expecting combined console and PC software sales to hover right around the ten percent threshold, which would bring total entertainment software sales to nearly $8 billion.</p>

<p>IDSA's annual consumer survey, which we've released this morning, also supports an upbeat view. We found that one-third of those who own either a Nintendo 64 or a PlayStation One say they intend to buy a new console in the next six months. And if console makers cut prices at some point this year, history suggests that the resultant boom in hardware sales will trigger a powerful surge in software sales which could push total sales into the mid double digit range.</p>

<p>But even as optimism prevails, there is reason to be cautious. Some of the same factors remain that kept sales last year from reaching the double digit growth targets many anticipated. Chief among them is the continuing weakness in the US economy. Last year, perhaps for the first time in its history, the video game industry was adversely impacted by broader economic trends. Moreover, the industry's penchant for pushing a huge amount of product to market in the fourth quarter caused retailers to be more selective about the products they stocked, further strangling the potential sales of many good titles that lacked blockbuster status. Any or all of these factors could dampen sales in 2003.</p>

<p>Breaking down the market further, we anticipate that console games will maintain their 80% share of the total entertainment software market. Still, the death of PC games has been greatly exaggerated. While PC game sales were down 3% in the first quarter, those numbers will probably be burnished with the release later this year of several very high profile titles. Further, IDSA research shows that in households with both a PC and a console, 55% use the PC most often to run entertainment software, and the PC is used to play games, including games on the Internet, more than it is used for any other application, including e-mail.</p>

<p>Which brings me to online games. The good news is that the percentage of most frequent gamers saying they play games online continues to rise, reaching 37% in 2003 compared to 31% a year ago and 19% in 2000. It's also clear that a certain genre of online games &#151; free, downloadable titles - are a mass market phenomenon and are growing in popularity. Even my 83 year old father in law plays them. In fact, nearly three-fifths of gamers surveyed reported that the online games they most often play are puzzle, board, card, and trivia type games, more than double the percentage of those who most often play action, sports, role play, or strategy games, and seven times more than those who say they most often play massive multiplayer persistent universe games.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both Microsoft and Sony got off to a strong start as they lay the groundwork for a thriving online console game market in the years ahead.</p>

<p>So there's no doubt that online, causal games on the PC are here to stay in a big way. And we also know that there is a profitable market for massively multiplayer fantasy games. And it looks like online console games will eventually reach critical mass. So the question remains when we will see the massively multiplayer PC game that breaks beyond the world of orcs and knights and into the mass market. The disappointing launch of the Sims Online was certainly a cautionary tale. In the months ahead, titles like Star Wars Online, Disney's Toon Town, and the Lord of the Rings Online will test the market yet again.</p>

<p>The fact is many potential online gamers are continuing to resist paying to play online, with only five percent of online gamers surveyed by the IDSA saying they are willing to do so. My view is that the golden era of online games will arrive - and it will arrive &#151; only when enough titles offer unique qualities that will convince consumers the content is worth paying for. Put another way, we're still waiting for the innovative titles and services that will appeal to a mass market audience.</p>

<p>If the future of online games is not much clearer than a year ago, one area of the market which is becoming more interesting involves mobile games. IDSA's consumer survey found a material uptick in the percentage of people who say they have played games on cell phones, from 14% a year ago to 18.3% in 2003. In fact, among handhelds, PDAs, and mobile phones, mobile phones were the only platform which saw an increase in usage in the past year.</p>

<p>Two factors are converging to make the cell phone a more promising platform for games. One is that the manufacturers have concluded that games are one of the keys to reviving sales of mobile phones. The second factor is that the business model is becoming clearer. While some mobile games will continue to be free, charging consumers a monthly fee which is shared by the carrier and the game publisher is becoming the norm. This makes mobile games more intriguing to game publishers because they offer a chance to generate a second source of revenue from a single piece of intellectual property, much like the film industry has been able to do for years.</p>

<p>So the state of the entertainment software across all platforms looks promising, and there is no reason to believe that the popularity of interactive entertainment has to peaked.</p>

<p>Those of you who've been here before have heard me explain the demographic trends that I believe are behind the popularity of video games. You're aware by now that the digital generations between ages 2 through 35 gravitate toward an entertainment form that allows them to interact with and control the experience, something they find more appealing than older, passive alternatives.</p>

<p>And once again this year, the IDSA consumer research validates the broad appeal of games. As in the past, a clear majority of those who play both PC and console games most frequently are over 18: 70% for the PC and 62% for the console. But what is most noteworthy is that the percentage of users in the under 18 category for both platforms has fallen. In the case of PCs, 30% of most frequent players are under 18, down from 34% in 2002; similarly, 38% of console players are under 18, compared to nearly 46% a year ago. It's not that young people are playing games less. Instead, what the numbers tell us is that the market is expanding and the graying of the video game audience continues.</p>

<p>Speaking of young gamers, it's worth noting that two thirds of parents surveyed by the IDSA said they think that the games their kids play are a positive addition to their lives. Moreover, nearly half of all parents surveyed said they play video games with their kids at least daily or weekly. So while there are some politicians conjuring up unsubstantiated fears about the impact of video games on young people, it seems those in the best position to know, parents, don't share these concerns.</p>

<p>One much remarked on by-product of the maturing game market this past year has been the appearance of more titles with mature themes. I confess it's a wonder to me why anyone is either surprised or troubled by this trend. Clearly, video games are not simply child's play anymore and our industry has no reason to apologize for creating games targeted at the segment of the market where demand is strongest and buying power greatest.</p>

<p>That said, though, let's keep this whole issue in perspective: only 13% of all video games sold in 2002 were rated Mature by the ESRB. And while the percentage of Mature games made and sold will continue to rise, there is still plenty of content for everyone. When all the dust settles from the furor over Grand Theft Auto, the fact remains that games rated Everyone and Teen continue to dominate the best-seller charts. Of the top 20 best-selling console games in 2002, 80% were rated E or T, while 90% of the top 20 computer games last year were rated either E or T.</p>

<p>This brings me back to innovation. I mentioned it briefly when discussing the challenge facing online games. And it is very relevant to any discussion about the growth and demographic profile of the broader industry.</p>

<p>Last Monday, the headline in the LA Times was "Game Makers are Playing It Safe." The article talked about the industry's reliance on licenses and sequels as an indicator that publishers have become risk averse. That's understandable. Top games cost $5-10 million to make, and sometimes more. And unlike other industries where new technology produces economic efficiencies, ours is the only industry I know of where the opposite is true: each new console and PC advance makes it harder, longer, and more expensive to make games. So there is little margin for error and turning to the familiar and successful is sound and prudent business.</p>

<p>But the issue isn't whether we make licenses or sequels. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with either. The question is whether we innovate and advance the art form. That can occur in original content, it can be found in sequels, and it can be found in licensed products. But in fact most of greatest artistic achievements of this industry, with few exceptions, have come with original content. Classics like Space Invaders, Sim City, The Sims, Civilization, Age of Empires, Half Life, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Sonic, Mario, Doom, Halo, Everquest, and Tomb Raider are just a few of the original titles that have helped define nearly three decades of video games.</p>

<p>And to the extent our future as an industry depends, as I think it does, on continuing to create innovative content, we should be wary of an overdependence on licensed content because this could undermine the originality and creativity so central to innovation. How ironic would it be that after years of aspiring to be as important as the film industry we end up relying on Hollywood for our most successful titles?</p>

<p>Our stature as an industry, our place in culture, will be determined by whether we achieve even higher levels of entertainment and artistic merit, and the only way we can reach this star is if we continually innovate.</p>

<p>Innovation does not mean coming up with better ways to kill characters or blow up cars, or with making better hardware. It means focusing more on character development and storylines, it means using artificial intelligence in ways that bring characters to life and enhance the player's sense that they're interacting with real allies and opponents who can outthink and outsmart them, it means looking for new genres that go beyond the tried and true titles that top the best seller charts annually.</p>

<p>The innovation imperative does not mean every game or every year we need to see something new and different. In music, we don't see new genres created every few years, and hardly every grunge band or country music singer breaks new ground; and how many movies these days are truly innovative? In fact, I'd say on a relative sense, the innovation that occurs in the game space compares quite favorably to that which occurs in other entertainment media. So we have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>But we cannot be complacent. Some of the most brilliant creative talent in the world is responsible for the products you will see here over the next three days. And more and more of tomorrow's creative geniuses see video games as an attractive outlet for their talent. So there is no shortage of imagination and skill being applied to designing the games of today and tomorrow. But we cannot consign them to a world where they must play safe. They need to have the freedom to create the classics that will attract and retain a generation of gamers for the next thirty years. It's the only way we will evolve as an art form.</p>

<p>The challenge to innovate this art form rests squarely on the backs of the designers and publishers who drive this industry. But there are external forces that threaten to discourage the very innovation we so depend on.</p>

<p>One danger is the relentless assault on copyright laws being waged by some so-called consumer advocates in Washington, and the accompanying wave of piracy undermining every creative industry in America, from video games to music to films and books. The cost to innovate is high and going ever higher, as I said a moment ago. Without strong IP protection, without confidence that good products will be rewarded with strong sales, the incentive to innovate is undermined.</p>

<p>In Washington today, several lawmakers have introduced bills to purportedly level the playing field between the rights of consumers to use digital works and the rights of copyright holders to protect their works against unauthorized use. These bills masquerade as consumer rights statutes but in fact will eviscerate the long accepted principles of copyright law that balance the interests of creators and consumers.</p>

<p>The premise of these bills is that the record industry and, to a lesser extent, the film industry, have failed to satisfy legitimate consumer expectations to use digital entertainment products in the manner they choose. Sponsors argue that copyright owners are denying consumers "fair use" rights. This argument is just plain wrong when it comes to the entertainment software industry. Our industry embraced the Internet as a distribution tool years ago and today, as my earlier comments about the online game market indicates. In fact, the entertainment software industry is not only meeting consumer demand, we are creating that demand through innovative use of the Internet, and some companies have the red ink to prove it.</p>

<p>One of the most insidious provisions of the bills would legalize mod chips and similar devices that allow consumers to circumvent, or hack, a product's technological protection measures for various "fair use" purposes. Here we have a pirate's dream come true and the intolerable prospect of Congress knowingly opening the floodgates to massive game piracy. Other proposals would create a digital first sale right that would, in effect, permit people to legally distribute tens of thousands of pristine copies of a video game or other work across the world as long as they promise to delete it before they forward it. Yes, and would you like to buy a bridge in Brooklyn?</p>

<p>These bills are dangerous and unnecessary. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that video game consumers are unhappy with the way they can access our products. And in its battle to accommodate music peer to peer file sharers, we do not want to see video games become collateral damage.</p>

<p>There's another set of proposals that also threaten innovation. These are the bills at the Federal and state level that would regulate video game content and sales. Most of the bills seek to ban the sale of either violent games, mature-rated games or, in the case of a bill awaiting action by the Governor of Washington this week, games that depict the killing of law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>Let there be no mistaking our intent when it comes to these bills: We will oppose every effort to regulate the sale of video games, not because we don't agree with the goal of keeping them out of the hands of minors, because in fact we have been leading the effort to persuade retailers to enforce the rating system with growing success. No, we will oppose them because if legislatures and courts accept the argument that video games lack the same unambiguous and absolute First Amendment protection afforded other entertainment art forms, they will destroy the incentives to innovate that are at the heart of the creative process. It is an unacceptable outcome. We will spare no expense to prevail on this point wherever and whenever such bills are enacted.</p>

<p>But even if they were not unconstitutional, these proposals would be misguided. Here's why: the FTC found that parents are involved in the purchase and rental of video games more than 82% of the time; IDSA's own research found that 96% of parents say they pay attention to the games their kids play, and that more than 90% of actual game purchasers are adults. What's this mean? It's simple: if kids have mature-rated games, chances are they got them from Mom and Dad. Supporters of these bills want to shift responsibility for parenting to retailers or game publishers. We believe that instead of politically-inspired rhetoric, kids would be better served by a concerted, cooperative campaign between industry, retailers, parent groups, schools, and government to make sure parents use the tools available to them to make informed decisions about the games they buy.</p>

<p>And if you have any doubt that some supporters of these bills care less about violence among youth and more about politics, consider this: Congressman Baca of California, who introduced the House bill to ban the sale of violent games to minors, also voted to give gunmakers immunity from liability for crimes committed with their products! And in the State of Washington, it is legal for a minor to own a handgun if under the supervision of a parent or guardian and there are no laws requiring trigger locks to prevent a child from accidentally discharging a loaded weapon.</p>

<p>The final area of innovation involving games I want to explore this morning is the use of video games beyond the living room. In fact, no other entertainment medium has such clear potential to have a positive impact on people's lives wholly apart from their entertainment value.</p>

<p>Let me share a few examples of what I mean.</p>

<p>The people in the MIT Games to Teach project understand that students today are different than twenty or thirty years ago, and we need to find innovative ways to engage and instruct the digital generation that go beyond work sheets and pen and pencil learning. And they're doing something about it. Led by Professor Henry Jenkins, they are trying to develop a new type of learning game that utilizes the same tools and design features in educational titles that so appeal to game enthusiasts in classic game genres. They're working on games designed to provide players with opportunities to collaborate, compete, or socialize with peers, and to tap into player's curiosity or fantasies by allowing them to play the part of an astronaut, physicist, or biologist who explores outer space, molecules, or the insides of DNA.</p>

<p>At this point, the target audience for games are more advanced students but the MIT team hopes that what they learn now can soon be applied to a new generation of games that will revolutionize the ways schools use educational software to complement core curriculums.</p>

<p>Video games are also the basis for an innovative way to teach kids Internet safety, something very much front and center in the national consciousness in the wake of the Elizabeth Smart case. For the past year, the IDSA Foundation has been providing financial support to a group called Web Wise Kids, which created a video game called Missing to help kids learn how to avoid Internet predators. Kids play through the game in the role of detectives looking for missing kids. The game is not easy; "winning" is not a sure thing. And the child detectives don't always find the missing child. The folks at Web Wise Kids will tell you that this video game has proven to be a more powerful tool to drive home the risks of going online than an Internet dos and don'ts fact sheet stuffed in the backpack. Finally, health care professionals have found that video games offer an innovative way to help kids manage diseases. University of California at Santa Barbara researchers found that children were able to improve their self care significantly and reduce their use of emergency services after playing games for managing asthma, diabetes, and preventing smoking. And a new study from Wheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia has suggested that playing video games, by creating distractions, may offer relief to children and others who suffer with chronic pain.</p>

<p>So as we gather for the ninth annual E<sup>3</sup> to look at the products that will entertain and delight tens of millions of people worldwide in the months and years ahead, it's useful to remind ourselves that interactive entertainment is an incredibly rich art form, and an incredibly powerful form of expression. Still in its infancy, we've already accomplished amazing things, and we have still not yet seen the best this technology has to offer. And if, as I hope, people within the games industry and outside of it harness the power of this medium, if they continue the rich tradition of innovating that has been a hallmark of the industry, games will not only give people tremendous entertainment value, they will positively and significantly affect our world in ways yet unimagined, and your children will look back on the games made in the first decade of the 21st Century and say, "Those were classics."</p>
