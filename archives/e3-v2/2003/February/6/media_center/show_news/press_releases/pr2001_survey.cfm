<p><b>IDSA ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF 6TH ANNUAL CONSUMER SURVEY REVEALING THAT GAMES ARE A CENTRAL PART OF AMERICAN LIFE</b></p>

<p><b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- May 17, 2001 </b> -- Providing strong evidence that the computer and video game industry is poised for explosive growth in the next five years, a new study released today by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>) shows that computer and video games have become a central part of our national life, with Americans playing games often and everywhere.</p> 

<p>&quot;Games are at the center of the home, they're on the Internet, they're in the schools, they're on cell phones and PDAs, on planes and in hotel rooms,&quot; said Douglas Lowenstein, president of the IDSA, the trade association representing U.S. computer and video game publishers which released its annual consumer study today.  &quot;From the living room to the friendly skies, games are truly everywhere.&quot;</p> 

<p>The IDSA's sixth annual consumer survey found that three-fifths of all game consoles in the home are either in the living room or the family room, putting these machines at the center of the home entertainment complex.  According to the survey, the typical family uses its console or computer to play games for an average of 10 to 11 hours per week, up about one hour over last year's figures. In addition, the average household has 2 console gamers and 2 ½ computer game players. The survey also found that Internet games are increasingly popular, with 24% of game players now playing games online, up from 19% last year.  Moreover, the study shows that games are indeed migrating throughout the lives of many, with 32% of Americans reporting that they play games on dedicated handheld systems, 5% play on personal digital assistants, and 12% play on cell phones.</p>   

<p>&quot;Computer and video games bring us into imaginary worlds and allow us to define who we are, how we behave, and how we relate to others in the game; they challenge us intellectually; they excite us; they educate and empower us. They are becoming the entertainment of choice for the digital generation,&quot; said Lowenstein.  &quot;Most of all though, games are popular because they're fun,&quot; he continued.  &quot;Year after year Americans -- whether they are frequent game players or not -- say that games are the most fun entertainment activity by far, a fact which translates into a bright future for the industry.&quot;</p>

<p>The study also provided answers to the following often-asked questions about games.</p>

<p><b>Who uses games? </b><br>
With respect to age, 70% of the most frequent PC gamers are age 18 and over, and a remarkable 40% of them are over age 35; console gamers skew slightly younger, with 43% of the most frequent players under 18, and 57% over 18; only 21% of the most frequent console gamers are over 35, significantly less than is the case with the PC. Thirty-nine percent of the most frequent users of the PC for games are female, and 61% of the most frequent PC gamers are male.  For consoles, 74% of the most frequent users are male, and 26% are female.</p>

<p><b>What types of games are played most often? </b><br>
Those who play PC games most frequently say they play action (25%), puzzle/board/card (24%), sports (19%) , and driving/racing (17%) games most often, while console gamers are most likely to play action (36%), driving/racing (29%), sports (28%), and role playing/adventure games (21%).  In addition, female PC gamers say they play puzzle/board/card games, action games, and learning games most often, while female console gamers play action, puzzle/board/card, and driving/racing games.</p> 

<p><b>Where are games found in the home?</b><br>
Thirty-eight percent of game consoles are located in living rooms, 33% are found in children's bedrooms, 21% in the family room, and 13% in the adult's bedroom, while 43% of computers used to play games can be found in the study or home office, 20% in the family room, 15% in the living room, 13% in the adult's bedroom and 4% in the kitchen.</p>

<p><b>Why do people play games?</b><br>
Thirty-four percent of Americans say computer and video games are the most fun entertainment activity, compared to 16% who said watching TV, 13% who said surfing the Internet, and 12% who said going to the movies. Moreover, 57% of those who play games most frequently report that they're more fun than any other entertainment activity, with TV a very distant second at 13%.</p> 

<p><b>How do games stack up against other applications used on the PC?</b><br>
The popularity of games in the home can also be measured by the fact that households report that playing games, either online or from the desktop, is the most common use of the PC in the home.  According to the IDSA research, the PC is used 31% of the time to play games, with e-mail ranking second at 21%.</p>

<p><b>How do people find the time to play? </b><br>
Forty-eight percent of most frequent game players say they cut back on playing board and other types of games in order to play interactive games, while 41% spend less time going to the movies, 36% watch less television, and 35% rent fewer movies.</p> 

<p><b>Who buys games, and how many games do they own?</b><br>
Ninety-seven percent of those who purchase computer games, and 90% of those who purchase console games are 18 years old or older.  Of those under 18 who purchase games, 83% say they get their parents' permission before doing so.   In addition, 53% of those who purchase PC games and 46% of console game buyers are female.  Most frequent users of consoles report that they own an average of 13 games, while PC gamers say they own about 11.</p>

<p>The annual survey was conducted by the Custom Research Division of the NPD Group for the IDSA. The study is the most in-depth and targeted survey of its kind, gathering data from more than 1,651 nationally representative households that have been identified as owning either or both a video game console or a personal computer used to run entertainment software.</p>

<p>The IDSA is the U.S. association dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies publishing interactive games for video game consoles, handheld devices, personal computers, and the Internet. IDSA members collectively account for more than 90 percent of the $6 billion in entertainment software sales in the U.S. in 2000, and billions more in export sales of American-made entertainment software. The IDSA offers a range of services to interactive entertainment software publishers, including operating a global anti-piracy program, staging the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show, fielding business and consumer research, and representing the industry at the Federal, State and local levels on a wide range of policy issues.
