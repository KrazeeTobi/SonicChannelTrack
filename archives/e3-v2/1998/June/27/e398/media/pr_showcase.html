<B>ATLANTA, GA -- MAY 11, 1998 --</B> This month's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>), to be held from May 28 to 30 in Atlanta, Georgia, will offer attendees a first-ever look at more than 1,600 new PC games, video games, and edutainment and educational titles, according to the results of a survey of E<sup>3</sup> 1998 exhibitors released today by Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), owner of E<sup>3</sup>.  E<sup>3</sup> 1998 will cover 534,000 net square feet of exhibit and meeting room space -- the equivalent of 35 football fields -- at the Georgia World Congress Center and will be home to 440 exhibitors.  Over 30,000 industry professionals from around the world are expected to attend the event, the world's largest trade show exclusively dedicated to interactive entertainment and educational software and related products. In addition to revealing the number of titles to be showcased, the 1998 E<sup>3</sup> Exhibitor Survey found the following:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>More than half of new titles to be shown at E<sup>3</sup> have a multi-player component.  

	<LI>Sixty percent of the new PC games will feature 3D graphics.

	<LI>Exhibitors will showcase hundreds of new third and fourth generation console titles (for 32-bit and 64-bit "next generation" consoles), which demonstrate developers' increased ability to take advantage of each system's advanced capabilities.

	<LI>Over 100 new titles have been designed exclusively for play on the Internet. 

	<LI>Exhibitors will show titles in more than 12 categories: Action,  Adventure, Children's Puzzle/Family Entertainment, Creativity, Driving/Racing, Education, Edutainment, Girl's Software, Reference/Special Interest, Role-playing, Simulation, Sports, and Strategy.

	<LI>E<sup>3</sup> exhibitors most often list Action, Adventure, Strategy, Edutainment,  and Sports as the categories containing their hottest new titles.

	<LI>About 30 percent of the titles at E<sup>3</sup> will have an educational or learning component.

	<LI>Almost 30 percent of the new titles will be available for more than one platform.

	<LI>Exhibitors will show state-of-the-art peripherals and add-ons for enhanced gaming experiences, including Force Feedback technology and speed-enhancing 3D accelerator cards.

	<LI>Seventy-five percent of exhibitors list people 18 and older as their most important demographic group. 

	<LI>E<sup>3</sup> exhibitors account for well over 95 percent of the 1997 U.S. market for interactive entertainment.

"One of the most important findings of this year's E<sup>3</sup> Exhibitor Survey is the fact that 75 percent of responding exhibitors list consumers ages 18 and older as the most important demographic group for their product lines," said Lowenstein.  "This coupled with the number and variety of titles being released for the first time at this year's show, reflect the continuing emergence of a mass market for video and computer games."<p>

E<sup>3</sup> '98 officially opens with a CEO Keynote Panel, set for Thursday, May 28 at 8:45 a.m., which will feature some of the industry's leading executives and present a unique opportunity for listening in on a free-wheeling discussion about the latest issues and trends in the $10 billion worldwide interactive entertainment software industry.<p>
