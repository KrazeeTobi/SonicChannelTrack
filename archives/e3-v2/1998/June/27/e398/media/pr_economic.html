<b><font size="4">IDSA REPORT REVEALS VIDEO AND COMPUTER GAMES INDUSTRY'S $16 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. ECONOMY</font></b><p>

<b><I>New Report Shows Industry's Far-Reaching Economic Impact</I></b><p>

<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. - APRIL 29, 1998 -</B> A major new report released by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) today reveals that the interactive entertainment industry generated $16 billion in economic activity in 1997, not including computer and video game hardware sales. This staggering figure highlights the industry's growing impact on the overall U.S. economy.<p>

These findings were released as part of the "Economic Impact of the Interactive Entertainment/Edutainment Software Industry Report" conducted bi-annually by the IDSA, the trade group representing the world's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, in association with Coopers &#38; Lybrand L.L.P.<p>

"Video and computer games are a mega-force in the new American economy," said Douglas Lowenstein, President of the IDSA. "This rapidly growing sector of the business community is creating tens-of-thousands of jobs, discovering new technologies, increasing exports, and greatly contributing to the overall health of the U.S. economy."<p>

The study found that the interactive entertainment software industry directly generated revenues of $5.1 billion in 1997 from the sale of computer, video, and Internet games and edutainment software. Another $1.3 billion was generated by the licensing and distribution of these products and through supplying original equipment manufacturers. In addition, approximately $9.6 billion in indirect economic impact in related industries was generated.<p>

"Every dollar spent on purchasing video and computer games generates multiple ripple effects throughout other segments of the economy, such as packaging and printing, retail, talent, equipment manufacturing, and numerous other businesses," said Lowenstein.<p>

"The interactive entertainment/edutainment software segment continues to be a fast-growing, vibrant business sector," said Warren Martin, Co-Chairperson of Coopers &#38; Lybrand's National Software Network. "This sector will continue to support and reinforce a strong U.S. economy."<p>

One of the report's most striking statistics -- especially in light of the industry's significant economic power -- is the relative youth of the companies involved. In fact, more than 60 percent of the businesses that responded to the survey are just seven years old or younger. Even more compelling is the fact that two-thirds of the businesses have reached profitability stage, compared to just 14 percent of young, venture-backed companies in other high tech areas.<p>

Lowenstein noted that the industry growth represents more than economic statistics on paper -- it directly affects thousands of Americans for whom it provides jobs.<p>

"The interactive entertainment industry directly employs at least 50,000 workers in the U.S. and 17,000 more internationally," said Lowenstein. "In the past two years the expansion in the industry's work force has topped 18 percent, compared to an average decline of 2.5 percent in the work force of Fortune 500 companies. In fact, the result of the industry's rapid growth was the creation of 20,000 new jobs in a variety of American businesses last year alone."<p>

The report also found that interactive entertainment companies are leveraging foreign market opportunities, which in turn positively affect the U.S. trade balance. According to the survey results, export sales of interactive entertainment products grew by 38 percent last year, despite ongoing battles with piracy issues.<p>

In addition, the industry plays a critical role in maintaining America's technological leadership. Last year, interactive entertainment businesses invested approximately $2 billion in new technology research and development, translating into an increase in R&#38;D spending of 20 percent by the average company in 1997.<p>

"This industry's continuing commitment to innovation and improvements in technology help propel the U.S. forward in its quest to be the strongest, most competitive country in the world," said Lowenstein. "Video and computer games are not only a great way to be entertained -- they're an important part of this country's current and future economic and technological leadership."<p>

Other highlights of the survey results include the following:<p>

_ Investing in plant, property and equipment (PP&#38;E) -- for example, by purchasing computers, office equipment, and buildings -- is an important way in which interactive entertainment companies help create jobs and support other industries. The average interactive entertainment company invests $1.2 million in PP&#38;E a year. By the time the average company is 10 years old, it invests over $10 million annually.<p>

_ Entertainment software companies' rate of productivity is high and growing. The industry's growth in revenues-per-employee ratio -- a measurement of how effectively an industry utilizes its employee base to generate sales -- was more than double that of the average Fortune 500 company last year.<p>

_ Companies in the interactive entertainment industry experience particularly rapid life cycle growth, with over 90 percent of respondents shipping product despite the overall youth of the industry, and 67 percent having passed the shipping state and reporting profitabilty.<p>

The study targeted over 650 publishers, developers, distributors, licensors, and other entertainment, edutainment and educational software companies that make up the interactive entertainment/edutainment software industry. Approximately 10 percent of the companies responded to the survey. Results were analyzed using means or averages, and compared to in many cases, similar data from the Industrial Fortune 500 companies.<p>

The Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) is the only U.S. association exclusively dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish video and computer games for video game consoles (such as Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation), personal computers and the Internet. IDSA members collectively accounted for more than 85% of the $5.6 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the U.S. in 1997 and billions more in export sales of U.S.-made entertainment software. The IDSA offers services to entertainment software publishers including a global anti-piracy program, business and consumer research, government relations and First Amendment and intellectual property protection efforts.<p>

Coopers &#38; Lybrand L.L.P. is one of the world's leading professional services firms, with more than 16,000 professionals and staff in 100 U.S. cities and, through the member firms of Coopers &#38; Lybrand International, more than 70,000 people in 140 countries worldwide. Its National High Tech, National Software, and Multimedia Industry Practices Groups provide value-added accounting, auditing, tax, and consulting services to emerging and mature high technology and new media companies.<p>
