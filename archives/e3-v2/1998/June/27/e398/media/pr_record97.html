WASHINGTON, D.C. -- MARCH 9, 1998 -- As preparations accelerate for this May's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>), the world's largest and most important interactive entertainment software trade event, it was announced today that video game and personal computer game software sales soared 38 percent in 1997, making it by far the fastest growing segment of the entertainment industry, said Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA).<p>

Based on data gathered by the NPD Group from its Interactive Entertainment Software Service, Lowenstein said that 1997 sales of video game software were $3.3 billion (up from $2 billion in 1996) and PC entertainment software sales were $1.8 billion (up from $1.7 billion in 1996), increasing total 1997 U.S. entertainment software sales to $5.1 billion.  With an additional $500 million in revenue from video game rentals (according to the Video Software Dealers Association), the interactive entertainment software industry has achieved a record $5.6 billion in revenues for 1997.<p>

"The astronomical growth of the interactive entertainment software market is further evidence of the ever-expanding appeal of this industry", said Lowenstein.  "Top games now debut with the same hype and anticipation accorded top movies and music albums, and often outsell them.  Tremendous amounts of time, money, and talent go into developing today's games. And whatever the platform, there is something challenging, interesting, and exciting for virtually everyone."<p>


According to NPD's TRSTS Video Games, strong 1997 sales of next generation consoles -- over 10 million consoles were sold last year -- pushed the estimated U.S. installed base of next generation consoles from 5.8 million in 1996 to nearly 16 million.  Action, sports, adventure and strategy games were the most popular types of entertainment software with each category capturing at least 10 percent of the market, reflecting the wide and varied tastes of consumers.<p>

"The industry's enormous success in 1997 sets up the most highly anticipated E<sup>3</sup> ever.  Running from May 28-30 in Atlanta, E<sup>3</sup> '98 promises to showcase the hottest, most cutting-edge technology in entertainment.  With entertainment software sales expected to continue to soar, E<sup>3</sup> remains the world's best place to get a handle on what's new and what's next in interactive entertainment," Lowenstein said.<p>

Currently in its fourth year, E<sup>3</sup>, set for May 28 to 30, 1998 at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, is the world's largest and most prestigious interactive entertainment trade event exclusively dedicated to showcasing interactive entertainment, educational software and related products.  E<sup>3</sup> is wholly owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) and is operated by IDG World Expo and IDG Expo Management Company.  IDG World Expo is a subsidiary of International Data Group, Inc., the world's leading IT media, research and exposition company.  IDG Expo Management Company is a premium provider of information events which shape the agenda of the Information Technology business.<p>

The Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) is the only U.S. association exclusively dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish video and computer games for video game consoles (such as Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation), personal computers, and the Internet.  IDSA members collectively accounted for more than 85 percent of the $5.6 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the U.S. in 1997, and billions more in export sales of U.S.-made entertainment software.  The IDSA offers services to entertainment software publishers including a global anti-piracy program, business and consumer research, government relations, and First Amendment and intellectual property protection efforts.<p>
