<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="arial, futura"><B>Interactive Entertainment is Everywhere</B></FONT><br>
According to the Interactive Digital Software Association's 1997 State of the Interactive Entertainment Industry Report, the interactive entertainment software industry generated $3.7 billion in retail sales in North America in 1996. Analysts predict sales in 1997 will reach $5.3 billion.  Worldwide sales will reach at least $10 billion and will continue growing at double-digit rates.
</P>
<P>
Next-generation 32- and 64-bit game consoles, which reached 5.8 million installed units in 1996, are estimated to grow to a total installed base of 30 million by 1998. IDC/Link estimates that the installed base of multimedia computers will grow from the
current 21.9 million to 75.6 million by 2001 in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Each year, all the major players in the industry convene in one location to showcase their latest products, innovations and technologies at E<sup>3</sup>. Make sure your company is exhibiting at the 1998 E<sup>3</sup> in Atlanta.
</P>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="arial, futura"><B>A Worldwide Business</B></FONT><br>
International markets are increasingly important to U.S. entertainment software companies, with many leading firms generating 40-60% of total revenue from sales overseas. This makes E<sup>3</sup> - with nearly 20% of its attendees coming from outside the U.S. - a critical event in your global marketing plans.
</P>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="arial, futura"><B>Spanning All Audiences</B></FONT><br>
Interactive entertainment isn't only for pre-teen and teenage boys. Over 42% of all console users are over 18, and 27% are female. Seventy-two percent of PC gamers are over 18 and 40% are female. Exhibiting at E<sup>3</sup> can help you take advantage of these new market opportunities by giving you access to industry buyers from non-traditional retail channels.
</P>


<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="arial, futura"><B>Attract Top Talent</B></FONT><br>
The entertainment software industry invests in its future - companies spent nearly $2.3 billion on research and development in 1995, and the industry's R&amp;D-to-equity ratio is twice that of the average Fortune 500 company. The industry directly employs at least 90,000 workers, many in highly skilled positions, with employment growing at an annual rate of 26% (compared to a 2% decrease in employment among Fortune 500 companies). 
</P>
<P>
But finding and attracting top talent is getting more difficult every year. By exhibiting at E<sup>3</sup>, you'll have the chance to meet and network with programmers, developers, designers, and marketing and sales people who can help propel your company into the future. You'll also have the opportunity to interact with financial analysts and venture capitalists who can help fuel your growth.
