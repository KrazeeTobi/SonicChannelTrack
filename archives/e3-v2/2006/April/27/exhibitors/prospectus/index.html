					<h4>Video Games &mdash; Superstars of the Entertainment Industry</h4>
					<p> Video game software and hardware continues to grow at a double-digit rate. It is now an industry with total sales over $10 billion in the U.S. alone. This growth has garnered the full attention of the movie, music and publishing industries. Everybody wants to be part of this fast growing industry.</p>
					<p> Think about it. There are big-budget movies based on video games. Books are written about video games. Major recording stars fight to get their music into video games.

					<p> Let's look at some of the facts. Today, 75% of American heads of households play computer and video games. The average age of a game player is 30; the average buyer is 37.

					<p> This is one business that's never been "business as usual." All indications point to continued accelerated growth for years to come.
