        <h2>Industry Profile</h2>
				<p> Whatever these games "mean" to the people who play them... they mean a lot. Fifteen years ago, video games were barely more than a cottage industry, if by cottage you mean the sticky back corner of a strip-mall bowling alley. Last year game sales hit $7 billion, in the same exclusive ballpark as movies (about $9 billion). We should count ourselves lucky. The video game is a brand-new medium, and we get to see it evolve from the very beginning.</p>
