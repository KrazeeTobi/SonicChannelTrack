        <p><b>W1 - Partnering with Madison Avenue: How to profit from the prominence of games</b><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#DEDED"><tr><td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">Tuesday, May 9, 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">Room 404AB&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">Games are fast becoming the advertising vehicle of choice for marketers keen on reaching the sought-after 18- to 34-year-old male demographic. But it takes a sharp eye to know what ad strategy works best for your game, as well as how to communicate with media buyers and marketers. The importance of developing an intelligent ad-based approach, however, cannot be overlooked. The Yankee Group sees these ad revenues jumping to $800 million by 2009. The Matrix Online and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory will soon include streaming ads. Shockwave.com recently announced its own in-game ad solution. And there's talk of Spectator Mode on Xbox Live replete with ads that appear during widely watched game matches. This session will look at current ad models, including in-game and around-game ads, product placement, and advergaming. Which agencies are committed to games? How is pricing determined, and what are typical budgets? How does the technology work? How are gamers reacting? Are measuring tools delivering quantifiable results? Are advertisers getting the results they anticipated? Hear from the publishers, developers, brands, and agencies actively leveraging the role games play in the lives of consumers.

And as broadband access becomes more pervasive, new business models have appeared to support the development of a new crop of casual games. This session will discuss what it takes to create a compelling, original, and profitable casual game. What new business models are driving revenues? Are "advanced casual games" more profitable than traditional titles? What impact are in-game ads having on the casual sector? What's behind the talk of VC-funded roll-ups of small independent casual game studios? How are casual games branching out into mobile, portable, and CD-ROM formats?

The use of dynamic camera angles points to movie directors and film editors lending their talent to the game industry, and it's no longer a surprise to hear the music of an Oscar-winning composer or headlining rocker playing in a game soundtrack. But it's more than talent that is shared. Intellectual property also makes the jump from one camp to another. Sometimes games make use of worlds from TV and movies, while other times, it's IP from the gameworld that lands on the big screen or TV. As the exchange of talent and properties increases, so does the complexity of the deals. This session will expose the nuts and bolts of the deal-making taking place behind the scenes. Who gets the biggest share of the pie when a video game is optioned or eventually turned into a movie? What is Hollywood looking for from a video game storyline? How does the game industry make contact with IP owners, musicians, voice actors, and screenwriters? What can game publishers expect to pay to license IP that originated on TV or in the recording studio?

While there may be commercial opportunities created by this growth, there has also been a rise in the abuse and infringement of game products.  Game piracy
also manifests itself overseas where there are international enterprises and organizations engaged in large-scale manufacture and exportation of pirate versions of game products to countries all over the world, with some countries experiencing piracy levels of over 75 percent. The industry has responded in many different ways to meet the challenge of game piracy but, because of a number of factors, it has continued to persist on a number of fronts, including in the United States.  This session will provide attendees with a number of different perspectives on the game
piracy problem in an effort to shed some more light on this complex topic and to offer some approaches and strategies that have been taken
