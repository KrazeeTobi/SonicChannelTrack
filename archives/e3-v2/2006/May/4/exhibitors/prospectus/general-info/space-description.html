					<h4>Exhibit Space Options</h4>
					<p> From open space on the exhibit floor to private meeting spaces, E<sup>3</sup> offers many alternatives.</p>
					<p class="strong">The space opportunities on the show floor include:</p>
					<h2>Exhibit Booths</h2>
					<h4><a href="../_pdfs/Space Descriptions/Linear booth.pdf" target="_blank">Linear</a></h4>
					<p> A linear, or in-line, booth is exposed to an aisle on one side only.  You cannot remove the side rail bordering an adjacent aisle, even if you have a corner booth location.  A standard linear booth measures 10'x10'.  A linear booth includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>10 feet of 8-foot high back drape</li>
							<li>10 feet of 36-inch high side drapes on both sides</li>
							<li>7"x 44" identification sign for company name and booth number</li>
						</ul>
					<p> No hanging signs are allowed over linear booths.  This booth must be carpeted with a 9'x10' carpet or custom carpeting that can be ordered through the exhibitor service manual.</p>
					<p> Adjacent available linear booths may be combined to create a 10'x20', 10'x30', etc.</p>
					<h4><a href="../_pdfs/Space Descriptions/Island Booth.pdf" target="_blank">Island</a></h4>
					<p> Booth space that is exposed to aisles on all four sides is known as an island booth space.  This space does not have a designated back wall of drape and is commonly used for displays that need exposure from all four sides. This space is 20'x20' or larger.  Island booths are permitted to have hanging signs based on the location and availability of overhead hang points.  This space must be carpeted.</p>
					<p> <span class="strong">10'x10' Turnkey Packages (Kentia Hall Only)</span><br />
							There are two alternate packages available from show vendor GES Exposition Services for the furnishing of a linear booth.  Please note that turnkey pricing is for furnishings and is in addition to the space cost.
					</p>
					<h4><a href="../_pdfs/Space Descriptions/on-floor Gem Wall MR.pdf" target="_blank">On-Floor Meeting Room</a></h4>
					<p> On-floor meeting rooms are located in designated areas of select exhibit halls. These rooms consist of four gray fabric-covered hard wall panels measuring approximately 10'x10'. The rooms include a locking door measuring approximately three feet wide.  A booth identification sign is provided with company name and is attached over the door facing the bordering aisle. The on-floor meeting room includes carpet. This meeting room does <span class="strong">not</span> have a ceiling.  Any proposed canopies must be approved by show management. Nothing may be displayed on the exterior of the meeting room other than this identification sign provided by show management.
					</p>
					<h4><a href="../_pdfs/Space Descriptions/On-Floor Meeting Room Plexi.pdf" target="_blank">On-Floor Meeting Room with Plexi Panel</a></h4>
					<p> On-floor meeting room wall panels may be upgraded by the substitution of a clear or smoked plexi panel.  This panel allows you to affix signage/graphics on the <span class="strong">INSIDE</span> of the panel for greater visibility. These plexi panels may be ordered through the official service contractor at an additional charge.
