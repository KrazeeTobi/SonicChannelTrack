    <p class="title">2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) FAQ</p>
    <p class="heading">What are the elements of E3?</p>
    A full schedule will be released in the coming months. However, it will include:<br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - Exhibit floor featuring the latest in interactive entertainment and peripheral technology;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - Press conferences held by both console companies and third-party publishers; and,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - Private, in-suite meetings with leading game company executives.
   
    <p class="heading">Who can attend?</p>
    E3 is open to all credentialed international and U.S.-based media, industry analysts, retailers, developers and business partners.
    <p class="heading">Who will be exhibiting at the E3?</p>

The event will be open to ESA members and non-members alike. Organizers also said they are expanding the list of companies eligible to participate. Companies involved in console, PC, online, and mobile game publishing and developing, qualified business partners, as well as makers of video game hardware and peripherals can exhibit.

<p class="heading">Are we going back to the "old" E3?</p> 

No, not entirely. ESA officials acknowledged that after conducting both qualitative and quantitative research about the E3 Media & Business Summit changes were necessary to better meet the needs of both exhibitors and attendees—including increased booth sizes, increased audiences, and an overall environment better reflective of the industry’s creativity and innovation.  

<p class="heading">Why the decision to remain in Los Angeles?</p>

Last year ESA decided to offer attendees a more centralized location but also a suite-based personalized event. Los Angeles offers exactly the type of facilities needed—convenient location for many of the presenting companies, ample meeting space for exhibitors, multiple hotels within walking distance to not only the main meeting center, but also to each other, as well as in environment that understands and appreciates the entertainment industry.

<p class="heading">Why did you move the Expo to June?</p>

The June date was chosen to maximize exhibitors and attendees’ event value. The June date does not disrupt development cycles and allows retailers an opportunity to make informed purchasing decisions for the holiday season. 



<p class="heading">I’d like to exhibit, who can I contact?</p>

Please contact IDG World Expo at (877) 216-6264.

<p class="heading">I’d like to attend E3. Who can I contact?</p>

<p class="title">Media</p>

<p class="heading">Will all media be able to attend to the E3? </p>

Yes. E3 is open to a wide range of print, broadcast and electronic media, not just those covering the video game industry. We encourage broader consumer media to attend the show to see what the excitement is all about.

<p class="heading">Will you require media credentials?</p>

Yes.

<p class="heading">What are the criteria for being credentialed?</p>

To be admitted as an industry professional you must submit two pieces of direct and current industry identification such as a company credit card, paycheck stub or W-2 form. Individuals who cannot provide such documentation will not be permitted to attend.

<p class="heading">I’m a blogger/podcaster, am I considered media?</p>

ESA will credential bloggers, podcasters and other media on a case by case basis.

<p class="heading">Will press conferences be open to credentialed media only?</p>

Attendance at console makers’ press events are determined by those companies. Individuals wishing to attend should contact their public relations contacts. Third-party press events will be open to credentialed E3 attendees.  

<p class="heading">Will there be media only hours for the expo floor?</p>

The show floor will be open to all attendees at the same time.

<p class="title">Analysts</p>
