<p align="center"><b class="headline">REMARKS OF DOUGLAS LOWENSTEIN, PRESIDENT, INTERACTIVE DIGITAL SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION
AT THE ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT EXPO (E<sup>3</sup>Expo)<br />May 22, 2002</b></p>

<p>Good Morning.  Welcome to the eighth annual Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>  

<p>Since it seems as if everyone is making major announcements, we want to make one of our own: Starting in 2003, E<sup>3</sup>Expo will become a three week show: the first week will be devoted to rumors and obligatory denials about major news; the second week will be devoted to announcements of all the news that was denied the previous week; and the third week, we'll have the show itself.</p>  

<p>Joking aside, as we meet here today, it's now irrefutably clear that video games have taken a permanent place with music and films to form the triad of American popular entertainment and culture.  A recent report by a leading investment banker, Jefferies Company, forecast that the video game market, including PC games, would reach $21.4 billion in North America alone by 2005, up nearly 300 percent from $8.3 billion in 2000, with the bulk of the increased revenue coming from sales of the software you will see here at this and future E<sup>3</sup>Expos.</p>          

<p>The other night, ESPN did an hour long special on video games and sports.  Near the end, John Madden was describing his involvement with the game that bears his name and he recalled how he and the designers would sit around trying to figure out how to make the game look more like TV.  Today, Madden said, he goes to TV meetings and they try to figure out how to make TV look more like the video game. "We've come a long way since then," he concluded.</p>  

<p>And so we have.</p>  

<p>I remember when we started the IDSA in 1994.  The first time I met a congressional staffer who actually played games was a cause for celebration.  Last month, though, 1,000 guests attended IDSA's annual Congressional Entertainment Software Day.  The congressional video gamers, it seems, have come of age.</p> 

<p>Indeed, within the next decade, IDSA will routinely meet with Members of Congress and top government officials who actually play video games and, within 20 years, the person sitting in the White House will be a once and future video gamer.</p>  

<p>So with the industry firmly entrenched as a business and cultural powerhouse, I want to focus more on the challenges and opportunities we face in the months and years ahead. In a global sense, video games have the potential to become the dominant form of personal entertainment in the 21st Century.</p>  

<p>For those of you raised on passive entertainment, such a claim may seem far-fetched.  But if you can look toward the future instead of clinging to the past, you'll see some neon signs pointing the way.</p>   

<p>Today's core game population is 18-35 years old.  They are the first generation for whom computer technology was a routine feature in their lives.  This 18-35 year old tech generation is now the dominant audience for games.  But what really bodes well for the industry's future is the fact that the generation behind them, the 6-17 year olds, are the first interactive generation in history.  They are the first to grow up not only with technology, but with interactivity at the center of their lives, both in the home and the classroom.  Television and movies are an important part of their lives, but for them, playing video games is as natural as listening to the radio was for my parents.</p> 

<p>Let me digress for a moment here and note that when you consider the fact that video game growth is being powered by people under 35, it's hardly surprising that political attacks come from a generation of people typically 45 and older who grew up with more traditional forms of entertainment and who are, frankly, unfamiliar with and even intimidated by interactive entertainment.  To them, manipulating controllers is as vexing as speaking Swahili.  They come from a world of passivity, not interactivity.  Every time I hear another politician blame video games for the latest societal ills, I wish they'd heed Bob Dylan's 1964 counsel: "Come Senators, Congressmen, throughout the land, and don't criticize what you can't understand."</p>  
 
<p>But, as I said, I digress.  I'll come back to this issue in a few minutes.</p> 

<p>If I'm right that the video game industry is offering a form of entertainment uniquely suited to the 6-35 year olds, the key to the future is whether these gamers will keep playing as they age.  And the evidence to date tells us that their enthusiasm for games is not a youthful passing fancy.  Video games, undeniably, are a staple part of their entertainment diets.</p>

<p>This can be seen from IDSA's annual consumer research, which we're releasing this morning.  The research contains a wealth of data on industry trends and demographics.  But especially relevant is what we found when we asked the most frequent game players in the household how long they've been playing, and whether they expect to continue playing a decade from now.  We found that nearly six out of 10 have been playing for six years or more, and the same six out of 10 said they expect to play more or the same amount ten years from now.  In short, they were gamers yesterday, they are gamers today, and they will be gamers tomorrow.</p>    

<p>The demographic trends I've touched on define the global opportunity for the video game industry's continuing growth.  So what can go wrong?  I believe the greatest challenge we face is to maintain a high level of creativity and innovation.</p>  

<p>For there will be competition for the entertainment dollars of the interactive generations and for the game industry to emerge on top it must avoid the temptation to play safe and take its audience for granted.</p>
  
<p>So will the industry meet the high expectations of consumers?</p>

<p</>There is no question that games will become ever more realistic, bordering on photo realism in coming years; some predict that real time voice audio will become common; all agree that games will be more immersive as players enter living, real time worlds where they raise evolving characters, economies, companies, landscapes, and more.  Artificial intelligence will become so advanced that characters in the games will have their own independent, autonomous personalities with whom players interact.  It may not sound like much but it really is an astonishing level of interactivity that other forms of entertainment can never achieve.  Ask yourself why a game like The Sims is so hugely popular with kids and adults of all ages?  It certainly doesn't look flashy and realistic.  The answer is, in part, precisely because of the relationship players develop with their Sims.  In the coming few years, more and more games will provide ever more sophisticated levels of interactivity, and The Sims phenomenon will be multiplied.</p> 
 
<p>That's the good news about content.  But there is a potential dark side.  The growing consolidation in the software publishing and development industry, the high cost of development, the continuing pressure on retail prices, and the emergence of a mass market audience represent a clear threat to the innovation that has been the fuel powering the industry's growth.  
The risk is that publishers may depend even more on high profile licenses, sequels, and add-ons, on 15 Grand Theft Auto clones as they opt to play safe and stick with the tried and true.  There's also a risk that companies will seek to duplicate the GTA genre not by pushing the envelope creatively, but by simply adding new layers of graphic violence, and that may have consequences far beyond a loss of innovation.</p> 
  
<p>There is nothing intrinsically wrong about sequels and licenses.  Game sequels often do evolve considerably from the original, and often take software engineering to new levels.  And licensed games are often brilliantly executed.  You'll see lots of examples of both on the E<sup>3</sup>Expo show floor.</p> 

<p>My own view is that that while we will undoubtedly see many games that do play safe, the commitment of game designers and publishers to innovate will survive and thrive.  I say that because we have a core and growing market of consumers who set very exacting standards.</p>
  
<p>Publishers fully understand that if they turn out a stream of derivative games lacking innovation and creativity, it's the surest way to lose hold of all those 6-35 year-old gamers who say they plan to be playing for ten years and more.     
Just as the demographics and technology create opportunity for the video game industry, online games hold out tantalizing promise for growth as well.</p>  

<p>But you've heard this before.  The same analysts who today talk of online games generating $1.5 billion by 2005 forecast five years ago that online games would generate, you guessed it, $1.5 billion by 2002.</p>
  
<p>Online games have progressed in the last few years.  In 1999, IDSA research found that 18 percent of the most frequent game players in the home played online; this year, the number was 31 percent.  However, the data also shows that most gamers still prefer playing offline, with the percentage who prefer to play online around 33 percent.</p>
  
<p>What's holding online games back?  Clearly, it's partly a dearth of content.  When those who don't play online were asked why, 30 percent said it was because they were not interested in the offerings available, three times any other explanation.  Equally significant, when non-online gamers were asked if they would be willing to pay to play, only six percent answered yes.</p>  

<p>So the challenge the industry faces is how to create online games that are both appealing and sufficiently unique that people are willing to pay to access them, to change the cost and value perception.  We need to reach the vast middle earth of gamers looking for games that are affordable, and easy to play and understand, and don't require a love of knights and gnomes.</p>
 
<p>This is why there is so much interest and excitement about online games like The Sims and Star Trek.  These high profile brands that have broad appeal and offer the potential for online games to become mass market entertainment.   That's also why there is so much interest in the announcements from Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo about their hopes for online console games, which may draw millions more gamers to online offerings.</p>
 
<p>But even if the games do get better, and even if more and more consumers are converted into paying customers, there is one remaining obstacle to the complete breakout of online games - and that's the slow rollout of broadband in the United States.  If broadband adoption is languid, it will be a drag on the prospects for online games.</p> 

<p>New opportunities also abound in the wireless space.  But even as publishers embrace this attractive way to both create relatively inexpensive content and leverage existing content on new platforms, questions linger about what business model will generate meaningful revenue from wireless games.  And, as with online games, the potential for wireless games is tied somewhat to the speed of the transition to high-speed wireless networks that permit better and faster game play.</p> 
   
<p>Two other issues loom large over the game industry's future: piracy and content regulation.  In the case of piracy, let's start by putting the problem in context.</p>

<p>What's remarkable about the industry's current position is that it has continued to grow even though we effectively sell product in only four regions: North America, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia/New Zealand.  
The bottom line is that there are dozens of countries around the globe where piracy obliterates the potential for a legitimate market for our products.  And yet, analysts and forecasters project double-digit growth for the industry for the next three to five years.</p>  

<p>So if we can even reduce piracy rates in some of these potentially lucrative markets, not even to zero, but even to 50 percent, the additional growth the industry would experience would be massive.</p>  

<p>But it will not be easy.</p>  

<p>The piracy and counterfeiting activities plaguing the game industry fall into two general, but intertwined categories: 1) the illegal manufacture of optical disc copies of games, largely controlled by organized crime syndicates; and 2) the worldwide Internet transmission of illegal digital copies of games.</p>

<p>Progress is being made on the anti-piracy front.  The US Government, with support from the IDSA, has recently won criminal convictions and jail terms for several individuals engaged in game and other software piracy, sending a strong deterrent message, and additional cases are in the works; some foreign governments, like Singapore, have similarly made a greater commitment to attacking piracy within their borders.  But summing up, the question is not whether piracy will stall the growth of the industry, but how much more we can grow if we can make headway in reducing piracy rates just a little.</p> 

<p>Let me turn to the last area I'd like to address, and really the one, which launched the IDSA.  I am speaking, of course, about attacks on violent video games.</p>

<p>Many of you have heard me recite the facts about games ad nauseum, about how most gamers are over 18, about only 10 percent or less of all games carry a Mature rating, about how this industry's demographic has broadened far beyond kids, and how publishers create content for people of all ages, tastes, and interests, just as other entertainment industries do.</p>

<p>Still, we hear the same ignorant statements about how violent games cause aggressive behavior.  I get calls all the time to comment on studies that purport to show that video games cause violence.  I can't remember the last call I got from someone asking about research that disputed such claims or discussed the benefits of games.</p> 

Two months ago, a study was released in the United Kingdom that found that computer games have a significant impact on the strategic thinking and planning skills of children.  "Adventure, quest and simulation games have a lot of benefit, they're quite complex and create a context in which children can develop important skills," said Professor Angela McFarlane, who conducted the study.  Moreover, the children in the study - and there were 700 of them - said that working in a team was the most important aspect of playing video games.  "Now, that's interesting when the stereotype is that children play on the computer exclusively on their own," commented McFarlane.</p> 

<p>Any of you write about that?  Hear any politicians make speeches about it?  Or about the study released by the Washington State Department of Health, which concluded that, "current research evidence is not supportive of a major concern that violent video games lead to real life violence?"</p>  

<p>Well, good news: I have copies of both in our offices and I challenge you to come pick them up and write about them.</p>  

<p>A few weeks ago, a federal district court in St. Louis ruled against the IDSA's motion to strike down a St. Louis County law that would criminalize the sale of Mature rated video games to persons under 17.  Now, mind you, the statute did not seek to ban the same stores from selling R rated movies to minors, or of CDs with parental warning labels.  No, it singled out video games for government regulation.   In his ruling, the judge declared that video games are not protected as creative expression by the US Constitution.  While we're confident that we will prevail when the case works its way to the federal appeals court - and if we don't, I fear more for our country than for our industry - the question remains: what is it about games that they are viewed with less respect?</p>

<p>I think the root of the problem is that most observers do not yet appreciate the fact that video games are artistic achievements every bit as worthy and creative as a film, a song, or a painting.  Does that mean every game is high art?  Of course not.  But art is defined as "the quality, production, expression or realm of what is beautiful or of more than ordinary significance."  Notice, there is nothing in the definition about whether everyone likes it or appreciates it.</p>
 
<p>What's different about games?  After all, many incorporate elements of cinema, music, stories, and drawings, and then add the ultimate ingredient - interactivity.  Maybe that's it: the interactive nature of the games interferes with the traditional way people assess art.  Yet, the irony is that if you printed a screen shot of the desolate landscape portrayed in Myst and put it in a gallery, it would almost surely be seen as art, yet it's not viewed that way when it's part of the game itself.</p>  

<p>Or maybe the problem is that the artistic expression so basic to game design is not always visually apparent in the finished product.  Ted Price of Insomniac Games wrote, "even though our industry has always relied on artistic expression to create unique gaming experiences, it hasn't been until very recently that we've been able to create visuals approaching those of other mainstream art forms.  And this has been our Achilles heel in convincing those who don't play games that games embody artistic expression beyond the visual.  Non gamers only see the surface &#151; the graphics we output &#151; and can't experience the story telling or the artistry in a cohesive game design."</p>

<p>So this is the problem we have to overcome.  And it brings us full circle.  In the next decade, it will be people who play games who will become the editors and opinion makers, the politicians and decision makers, the cultural trendsetters and the critics.  As that happens, and as games continue to evolve, this last battle for legitimacy will be won.  As MIT Professor Henry Jenkins says, computer games are "going to be the most significant art form of the 21st century."</p>

<p>I want to close with a few items gleaned from recent press clippings that collectively capture some of the themes I've tried to touch on this morning:</p>

<p><b>Item:</b> On April 26, Associated Press reported that Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is planning on making video games touting his political accomplishments and distributing them via his campaign website and CDs or DVDs.</p> 

<p><b>Item:</b> The Royal Shakespeare Company has announced that it may begin making games for PlayStation 2 based on the Bard's greatest plays as a way to draw the MTV Generation to Shakespearian theatre.  Wonder what the cultural critics of video game violence will say when they see bodies falling in Macbeth, the video game?"</p>

<p><b>Item:</b> London's famed Barbican Art Gallery has just opened an exhibit called "Game On" chronicling the history of video games.  The exhibit moves on to the prestigious Royal Museum in Edinburgh, Scotland, the first leg of a world tour.  Said exhibit curator Conrad Bodmin, "One of the things I wanted to express was that a lot of traditional artistic work went on before you got to the computing side."</p>

<p><b>Item:</b> Talking about why games are universal, gamer Dennis Fong, said, "There are no gender barriers, no physical limitations - it doesn't matter if you're 2 feet tall or 6 feet tall.  And there are no geographic barriers - you can play against someone across the world.  The fact that my friend can be one of the top gamers in the world and be a paraplegic, that is the epitome of what gaming can be."  And that says it all.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
