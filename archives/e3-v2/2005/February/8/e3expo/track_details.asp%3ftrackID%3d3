This session will bring attendees up to speed on how product placement deals are done, what games are viewed as being right for ads, what new technologies are in play, and how the effectiveness of ads is being measured. Publishers and developers will learn how to secure in-game ads for their titles, what advertisers and media buyers are looking for, and how to derive value from the robust new in-game ad marketplace.
