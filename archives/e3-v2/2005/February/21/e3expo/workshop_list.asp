No publisher wants to spread themselves too thin, but no one wants to be left behind either. Picking the right platform is crucial, so how do you choose which is right for your business? A group of top-performing publishers and developers will discuss which platforms they are supporting and why. Where do they see the markets heading? Which platforms are likely to outperform the others and which are likely to lag? When is publishing for the PC an intelligent choice? When will mobile take off? How will consumers react to the new, more powerful consoles? Listen in as industry leaders discuss how they filter the profusion of information and make their own choice.&nbsp;</td>

This session will look at how both the developer and publisher address the challenge of finding franchise-worthy games. How can a development studio think about sequel value without straying from its creative soul? How do publishers determine if an original IP will progress from """"great first effort"""" to top-selling and long-enduring franchise?&nbsp;</td>

One is to focus on mid- to lower-priced games with similarly scaled budgets. Regardless of whether you decide to build this formula into your business model to reduce risk or base your entire business enterprise on it exclusively, this session will focus on creating profitable games for the value-conscious consumer.

What is the demographic profile of the new, casual gamer and what are they looking for from the single- and multiplayer experience? What games are selling, what do they cost, who is developing them, what is the typical return on investment? What revenue models have the most traction with consumers: ad-backed free play, sponsored, subscription, free trial, or the free to play/pay for avatar model?
