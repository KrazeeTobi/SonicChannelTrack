        <td class="tableCell" colspan="2">For an original game idea, life is hard. In 2003, only one original-IP game made it into the top 25 best seller list. The year before, there were only two original games in the top 25 list. Yet all publishers look for that original property they can sign and turn into the next big franchise. This session will look at how both the developer and publisher address the challenge of finding franchise-worthy games. How can a development studio think about sequel value without straying from its creative soul? How do publishers determine if an original IP will progress from """"great first effort"""" to top-selling and long-enduring franchise?&nbsp;</td>
