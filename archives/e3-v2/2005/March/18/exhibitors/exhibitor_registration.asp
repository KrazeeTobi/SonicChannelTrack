                                For each name submitted prior to the April 15th deadline you will receive a printed name badge and badge holder. The Exhibitor badge allows access to the show floor Wednesday, May 18 through Friday, May 20. It also allows access to the show two hours BEFORE the opening and one hour AFTER the close of the show floor on show open dates. Exhibitor badges and badge holders are strictly for exhibitor personnel working in your company's booth during the show. For security reasons, these badges are <b>not</b> to be utilized for clients, friends, etc., who are not working the booth.
                            </p>

                                In addition to your Exhibitor Badges, you will be eligible to receive an allotment of 
                                Set-Up/Tear Down wristbands for your exhibitors and exhibitor-appointed contractors (EAC's). These wristbands are to be used during both Set-Up and Tear Down. Exhibitor badges will NOT allow access to the floor before or after show open days. You may order these wristbands in advance by completing the Set-Up/Tear Down Wristband Order Form located behind the Registration/Lead Retrieval/Travel Information tab. These wristbands will also be available on-site in the Security offices in both the West and South Halls and will be given to only EAC's and Exhibitors who have turned in their liability insurance certificate. The wristbands will be valid during the show Set-Up/Tear Down days only. If you have any questions, you may contact the E<sup>3</sup> Exhibitor Help line at (877) 216-6264.

                                E<sup>3</sup> strongly discourages anyone under 18 on the exhibit hall floor. Children who are demonstrating your product in your booth must be badged as Underage Exhibitors and must be pre-approved. No children under 18 will be allowed to register at the show. Those individuals under 18 years of age working in your booth are permitted in your booth only and are not to be in other parts of the Exhibit Hall.

                                <b>Exhibitor Badge Pick-Up Procedures:</b><br />
                                All badges requested prior to April 15, 2005 will be sent to the exhibitor contact specified upon registration. These badges will be mailed 2-Day Federal Express and a confirmation including your FedEx tracking number will be sent to your contact. All badges mailed will include a badge holder. These badges will be valid only during show open dates so please remember to request your Set-Up/Tear Down wristbands via the form found behind The Registration/Lead Retrieval/Travel Information tab in your service kit. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Any badges requested after the April 15, 2005 deadline will need to be picked up on-site at Exhibitor Registration in both the West and South Halls of the Los Angeles Convention Center. <b>Photo identification must be presented before obtaining your name badge.</b>
                            </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                            
                            <p>
                                It is important that you communicate to your booth personnel and contractors you hire, when and where they must pick up their badges. Without a badge and badge holder during show days or a Set-Up/Tear Down Wristband, they will not be allowed on the show floor under any circumstances.
                            </p>

                                To avoid waiting in lines, we strongly suggest registering your booth personnel by the April 15, 2005 deadline and requesting your set-up/tear down wristbands in advance. ONLY the first day of wristbands will be sent out. Each additional day you will need to pick up your wristbands daily at the security offices.
