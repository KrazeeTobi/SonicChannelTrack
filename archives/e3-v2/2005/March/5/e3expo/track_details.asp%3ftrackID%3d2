							<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">As publishers acquire talent and technology--bringing the means of game development in-house--they have become more selective about which remaining independent studios they will work with. As a result, many small studios have been squeezed out of the market, and sometimes out of business entirely. Yet, the start-up scene remains an attractive choice for many. Every year, new studios are created. Even new publishers are being founded. The successful enterprises have invariably been built on a unique proposition, be it their funding model, choice of distribution channel, their project management protocols, choice of platform, location of operations, or degree of partnering with other indie shops. This session will focus on smart strategies for independent developers and publishers today. Find out how they've set up their businesses to maximize success and discover if their steps are worth following.&nbsp;</td>

The draw: an increasing numbers of gamers connected via broadband access and networked consoles, and maturing revenue models, including micro-transactions that have already proven successful in Asia and Europe. The possibility of tracking user preferences, including the application of Address book-like features, will also open up new marketing opportunities. Designers, visionaries, and business development executives will discuss what business models will be the main source of revenue for the online games of tomorrow. Listen in as they discuss subscription-based, pay-for-play, and free-to-play with in-game sales models.

But now, and with increasing success, digital distribution models are being used by a wide variety of game industry players. Even as pioneering technology and high-speed connectivity link game developers, publishers, and consumers in new ways, major challenges remain, specifically: how does the industry develop business models and delivery solutions where everybody wins? This session will look at how the new opportunity to distribute games over the Web changes the traditional developer/publisher relationship, how digital distribution impacts costs, where new opportunities for small-scale operations lie, ways a robust and secure digital distribution channel changes the retail value chain, and ways developers and publishers can shift consumer behavior into new buying models.&nbsp;</td>
