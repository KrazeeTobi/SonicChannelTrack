What are the secrets to developing game characters that draw in gamers? Equally important, what will be the secrets as better technology and AI expand the possibilities in the future for developing compelling game characters?  What counts most? Is it physical appearance, humor, emotional depth, or ability to overcome challenge? What must-have traits do newly-minted characters need to gain immediate traction with gamers? And what traits should designers avoid? This session will bring together some of the industry's most successful game creators and ask them to share their formula for creating strong, compelling characters-and top-selling games.&nbsp;</td>

How did the games' designers free their creative spirit in order to push the boundaries of convention? How did they come up with their game's mechanic, storyline, character lineup, and interface? How is it that in an industry that is accused of following franchises to excess, these designers succeeded at getting publishers to back their efforts?

							<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">The concept of content-integration is slowly coming out of the shadows. Final Fantasy crosses over to film and music--and with one title in the franchise, unites PC and console gamers in the same game space. The Matrix Online crosses over to comic books, capturing a wider audience as it breathes additional life into the digital experience. And The Sims is about to give a TV version of the brand a try. Publishers are promising deeper integration of gameplay--developing games that are seamlessly linked between the PC and console, mobile and PC, and handhelds and mobile (while developers are deep into the science of delivering the programming tools to executing on such a grandiose scheme). Similarly, the game industry trend to link media--comics, music, movies, and TV--is getting stronger than ever. This session will focus on how platforms are leveraged to provide a multi-platform yet unified entertainment experience. What is the impact on cost? How can the excitement of gameplay on one platform, or from one medium, transfer to sister platforms and a wider range of media vehicles? Speakers will discuss the technology challenges, marketing potential, impact on promotion strategy, and emerging consumer expectations as content becomes unhinged and available through a variety of complimentary channels.&nbsp;</td>

The entertainment options for consumers in these regions are wider, the technology networks more advanced and, therefore, the games are often more inventive. . Bluetooth-enabled gaming, the increased number of GPS-based community games, and the integration of onboard cameras into the game mechanic are a few of the inventive applications already present overseas. Exposure to the idea mill in Europe and Asia will prepare you for the coming handsets, developing platform technologies, and possibilities that will soon be within reach in North America.

But recently, some of the more popular games have mixed and matched distinct genres that had rarely, if ever, appeared in a single title. Tony Hawk's Underground's straight-up extreme sports simulation with open world mayhem and Grand Theft Auto III's revolutionary combination of platformer-like running and jumping, driving, third-person shooting, and melee combat gameplay stand out as recent genre-blending successes. This session will focus on how developers and publishers calculate and predict what genre combinations are right for each other, the role market research plays in the process, and the challenges designers face as they stir together diverse genres to create a new recipe they hope will form the foundation for the hit properties of tomorrow.&nbsp;</td>
