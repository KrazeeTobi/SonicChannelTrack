    <h3>E<sup>3</sup> 2006 Call For Speakers</h3>
    <p><strong>Deadline for submissions is November 18!</strong></p>
    <p>As a faculty member, you have the opportunity to educate and share your knowledge of what's going on in today's game industry with a core group of industry professionals.  Over 2,000 dedicated attendees attend E<sup>3</sup> not just for the excitement of the show floor, but also for this opportunity to improve their business and creative skills.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Our ground rules for participating in the Conference Program are simple and few: </strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your participation should be in the spirit of commitment to your peers in the computer game industry.</li>
      <li>All faculty members are responsible for their own travel and lodging. E<sup>3</sup> Show Management does not offer any fees or remuneration for appearances on panels or in workshops.</li>
      <li>This is not a sales opportunity.  Our audience, the moderator, and show management will not tolerate nor invite back anyone who uses this presentation time to sell themselves or their company.</li>
      <li>As an E<sup>3</sup> Conference Program faculty member, we consider you a VIP guest of E<sup>3</sup>. Registration is complimentary and a speaker badge allows you to attend all conference sessions and gives you access to the show floor and all its activities. Your affiliation as a speaker will be used in all appropriate marketing materials.</li>
    </ol>
