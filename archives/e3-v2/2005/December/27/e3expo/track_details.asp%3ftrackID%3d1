Technology bells and whistles? A perfectly paced learning curve? Some games that seemed to "have it all" and were released to high scores from reviewers bombed on the sales charts. On the other hand, some games that missed their marks and received dismal ratings have turned out to be blockbuster chart movers. How can those facts be explained? What can be more important than exceptional gameplay and a great feature set? This session will focus on the real-world factors that influence sales. How do recognizable IPs help capture a wider audience? How important is balanced gameplay that challenges core gamers as well as entertains the mass market? What learning curve is the perfect learning curve? How much outside talent is necessary, and how do you manage it appropriately? Accomplished designers discuss how they prioritized these criteria, why they decided to include some and not others, and how their decision s affected sales. &nbsp;</td>

							<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">Creating a single blockbuster title is hard enough, but creating a game that can spawn an ongoing series is doubly hard. For every Need for Speed and Grand Theft Auto, there's a one-shot wonder that died after the first iteration or sequel. What separates games that have franchise potential from those that can't endure even a single update? What is it about a game's characters, world, set of challenges, or reward system that gives it franchise legs? And is there a downside to annualizing a title year after year? This session will look at four of the most significant franchises of the past decade and will determine the key elements behind their success. How was their superstar status maintained over the course of years, through platform updates and generational shifts among gamers? How was feature innovation used to maintain a game's relevance with consumers? In what ways can sequels enable innovation, giving designers their best opportunity for showcasing a killer app? Hear key members of each game's design team share their unique recipe for creating games that remain top sellers release after release.&nbsp;</td>

							<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">What does it take to work within a popular genre but outside the boundaries of expectation? Is innovation really as absent from the current generation of games as many claim? This year, a number of titles answered industry critics and proved that originality and inventiveness in game design are limited only by a designer's intelligence, inspiration, and imagination. Nintendogs, Guitar Hero, Guild Wars, and Spore, working within the long-established genres of animal raising, rhythm games, action, and sandbox simulation, confirm that innovation in game design is still a reachable goal. This session invites designers from each of these teams to discuss how they came up with the idea for their game, the amount of play-testing each game went through, what type of market research backed the release, the challenges faced securing support, and, looking back, what they think they could have done better.&nbsp;</td>

While not easy, opening up a single, persistent gameworld to PC, console, and portable gamers is now within reach. Taking the first real steps was Final Fantasy XI, which linked PlayStation 2 and PC gamers. Recently, that title opened its gameworld to Xbox 360 gamers as well. While FFXI may have been the first title to offer this level of cross-platform gaming, it won't be the last. Developers are designing the infrastructure that will link gamers on home terminals seamlessly with each other as well as with gamers on the go. This session will focus on where the industry stands today in enabling massively cross-platform (MCP) games. What are the remaining technical challenges? How will MCP games change the consumer experience? And how will MCP games alter the relationship between the publisher, developer, and platform owner? Hear how designers, publishers, and technologists are preparing for MCP games, and find out how soon they will become the norm.&nbsp;</td>

Can a game make you cry? Can it make you believe in a character's mission, in a character's struggle, strengths, weaknesses, and values? Through the inclusion of story specialists--actors, screenwriters, editors, and special-effects experts--games have made spectacular leaps in delivering an immersive experience. The industry's top designers will share the podium with crossover talent from a variety of entertainment arts as they discuss how to create a game that can hold a player's attention for ten to fifty hours, how they invest game characters with emotion, passion, and intelligence, how they build heartbreak, joy, and fear into the story, and what genres are needed in a single title to deliver a satisfying and complete experience.&nbsp;</td>

What technologies are enabling mobile game designers to unleash their imaginations on the almost half a billion [ck] mobile gamers worldwide? What does increased CDMA and 3G coverage mean for game creators? What are the most creative games under development that use 3G technology? What is the state of creative and original game development using J2ME and BREW-enabled handsets today? Where are we in the transition from 2D to 3D in mobile? With the combined European and US mobile markets predicted to drive $2.4 billion in revenue by 2008, knowing the upper limits of technology will help you squeeze the maximum creativity from wireless handsets and increase your chances for success in the mobile game marketplace. &nbsp;</td>
