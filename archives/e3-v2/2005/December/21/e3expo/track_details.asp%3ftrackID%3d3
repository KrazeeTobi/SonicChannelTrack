Portable, mobile, "small file," and downloadable PC games offer an opportunity to enter the high-stakes game industry with a far smaller war chest. No matter what your budget--$100,000, $500,000, or $1 million--opportunities for the intelligently run development studio are many. Which markets are underserved by the current selection of games? Is it too late to enter the casual game marketplace? What potential exists in localizing foreign-developed games for the North American market? Is direct-to-consumer "off portal" distribution of mobile games an option yet? What are realistic budgets for developing Nintendo DS, Sony PSP, and mobile games today? How do you fund your game idea? How do smaller developers and publishers manage distribution? This session will ask a panel of independent developers and developer hybrids how to compete with the bottomless bank accounts of the big publishers.&nbsp;</td>

They are too skeptical to be swayed by traditional print ads, 30-second spots, or marketing calls. Instead, pro blogs, programmed word of mouth campaigns, and strategically deployed armies of covert product ambassadors are among a marketer's secret weapons. This session will explore the influence factors that guide the purchasing decisions of today's youth market. Whose information do they trust? Which brands do they believe in? How important is price? How do they communicate with their network of friends? Knowing how consumers think and what they are motivated by can help you map out an effective sales strategy. Hear from marketing experts and researchers how your game can maximize its presence among connected consumers. Instead of going against their style, make their passion, opinion, and power of persuasion work for you.&nbsp;</td>

How do games enhance the value of their own brands? Where are untapped opportunities for collaboration? Are there efforts to develop original and unique IPs through collaboration early in the creative process? How can TV regain viewers by an alliance with the game industry? And how are game companies maximizing the relationship for added profit?

With estimates of worldwide revenues doubling by 2008, ignoring the European, Middle East, and Asian territories means missing out on opportunities to grow your business. Most US publishers, in fact, drive a third or more of their revenues from outside North America. Knowing what the trends are in the robust markets of China, Korea, Germany, and the UK, among others, is essential to owning a piece of that revenue pie. In this session, analysts from the major territories (including the US) will present an overview of each market. Who are the biggest players, and how much of the market do they control? How is each market expected to react to the next-gen systems, new handheld platforms, and increased mobile usage? How is the online game sector expected to grow? Which regions are in expansion mode and which are stagnating? Analysts will present the latest data, including consumer trends, predominant and emerging business models, market share forecasts, and significant technologies affecting the game industry. What lies ahead? Attendees are invited to bring their questions: This group of experts thinks they know.&nbsp;</td>

							<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">The stage is being set for massive change in mobile communications and entertainment. Upcoming technologies are disrupting current business models and creating entirely new ones in their place. Already, mobile operators are aggressively pursuing services and channels, including games, designed to boost data spending. In addition to cellular initiatives, steps are being taken to develop Wi-Fi connectivity at the metropolitan level and to ready mobile WiMAX deployment for 2007. Amid this dynamic, where does your business model fit in? Panelists from the carrier and developer camps will discuss how mobile games and the user experience will change over the next one to five years and what business models are likely to thrive as mobile games advance. Why are event-billing and publisher-branded distribution like i-mode popular in Europe and Japan and not in the US? How can the industry use the opportunity to upsell a non-core audience a full console or PC title by providing a mobile version of that game? What new gameplay possibilities will come with more pervasive Wi-Fi and WiMAX coverage? And in what ways will ad hoc wireless connectivity change the way mobile games are designed, sold, and played?&nbsp;</td>

The skill sets required to develop a technically sophisticated game are changing and now extend beyond the existing range of coders, programmers, and level designers. Is earning a video game degree from an art school or university enough to get your foot in the door? Which skills from outside the game industry can facilitate a transition into the game biz? Today, expertise from special effects, art direction, and film is being joined by know-how and talent from the music industry, architecture, history, illustration, and psychology. On the business front, the management, marketing, human resources, and legal teams are also in need of bolstering.
