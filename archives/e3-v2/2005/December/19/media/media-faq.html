New this year - qualified Media can purchase a "Pick Six" Session Pass for just $120. This allows you to attend 6 sessions from the 12 workshops and 22 session program.   Be one of 50 to pre-register for this special offer
				by April 7th and receive an E<sup>3</sup> gift, great for the media-on-the-go.</p>

				<p>Also new this year will be a dedicated area of 20 seats reserved just for Media in each session and workshop at no cost on a first-come, first-served basis.  Other than the option of purchasing the Pick Six or be one of 20 to occupy the Media seats, all media will be asked to wait until the session has been filled with paid attendees.  The Conference Department hopes that these two new options will serve the Media's needs more efficiently and make it a more enjoyable educational experience.></p>
