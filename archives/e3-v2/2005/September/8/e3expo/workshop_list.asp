						<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">It's more than technology that separates the platforms. The PC, PSP, DS, Xbox2, PlayStation 3, GameCube 2, legacy systems, and mobile platforms each have their own set of opportunities, costs, and risks. Knowing how they differ--the size of the market, the demographic profile of users, and the cost to develop--is the first step toward creating a successful publishing strategy. 
In this session, a group of top-performing publishers and developers will discuss:

*How their strategies differ by platform (which platform was picked for specific titles and why).

*What genres they are targeting toward each platform, and how their advertising and marketing plans differ.

* Where they see each of the markets heading and what they see as the strengths and weakness of each platform? 

*How they intelligently develop a single title across multiple platforms for maximum return on investment. 

* How they see consumers adapting to the next-gen consoles? 

Listen in as industry leaders discuss how they filter the wealth of information, evaluate available data, and make their choices.

						<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">As consumers move away from traditional advertising vehicles such as print and TV, and spend more time playing games, advertisers, agencies, and publishers are hammering out a set of best practices to effectively place ads in games. This session's presenters will take attendees inside the fast-developing business model that marries the reach of games with the appetite of brands to deliver impressions. Speakers, drawn from different points in the value chain-the brand, the agency, the game maker, and the technology provider (from both the traditional and mobile spaces)-will each present a case study that highlights their unique solution and approach. As the total market for in-game advertising climbs from $200 million to an estimated $1 billion worldwide by 2008, understanding the goals of advertisers, the nuances of in-game ad placement, and the technologies that seamlessly deliver the messages, will separate the participants from the observers.
 
This case-study approach compliments Thursday's session 3.7 which focuses on the publisher's perspective of in-game advertising. These two presentations make for a complete introduction to one of the industries fastest growing business models.

The year before, there were only two original games in the top 25 list. Yet all publishers look for that original property they can sign and turn into the next big franchise. This session will look at how both the developer and publisher address the challenge of finding franchise-worthy games. How can a development studio think about sequel value without straying from its creative soul? How do publishers determine if an original IP will progress from "great first effort" to top-selling and long-enduring franchise?&nbsp;</td>

						<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">As more and more devices become networked--not only personal computers via the Web, but also game consoles, mobile phones, TV/media viewers, and household appliances--the network becomes pervasive. But what of the programming created to flow through this network? How is this convergence of 'network' and 'media' changing our basic conceptions of what media can and should be? And how does the 'game' fit into (and dominate) this landscape, as it has in virtually every other venue in which humans engage as audience or participants. In this special luncheon session, author Jim Banister-- "Word of Mouse: The New Age of Networked Media" (Agate, 2004)-- will discuss the implication of consumers who no longer just consume, but also produce, distribute, and market digital content along side the brand owners; how networked media is transforming the audience's relationships with products, services, and entertainment; how the game industry is contributing to that evolution; and how game programming will most likely evolve as a result of these accelerating market dynamics.

						<td class="tableRowEven" colspan="2">China is one of the hottest markets in the global game industry today. According to IDC China and China Game Publishers' Association, online games in China drove US$297 million in 2004, an increase of almost 50 percent over the previous year-and IDC forecasts steady growth over the next five years. The growth is not simply due to China's large population, but the Chinese government's role in nurturing both the localization of externally-developed games and for its decision to encourage and support the development of games from internal, China-based studios. In this session, Mr. Xiao Wei Kou, Deputy Director of GAPP, will discuss how the Chinese government is fueling growth: Mr. Kou will also discuss how the Chinese government is discouraging piracy and hacking, as well as the process North American publishers need to go through to get their games approved for sale in China. This session will mark the first time Mr. Kou has spoken publicly outside of China. Mr. Kou will be introduced by Lisa Cosmas Hanson, Founder and Managing Partner of Niko Partners, LLC.

This special session will bring together three unique observers of the mobile sector and ask them to present their most recent data and findings. An industry analyst, a developer/publisher, and the chair of a global trade association which represents a number of key participants in the mobile entertainment value chain will each present their most up-to-date findings on mobile game consumers--and the mobile marketplace in general. A focus on the emergence of "tweens" as a driving force in the mobile marketplace (including a breakout of gender preferences), usage figures, how revenues are tracking, adoption rates, trends in consumer behavior, as well as trends in Europe will make up the bulk of the session's presentations. Hear three unique perspectives on the mobile marketplace and use the information to your advantage.

One is to focus on mid- to lower-priced games with similarly scaled budgets.

Is the muse that contributes to the game design process wholly new for each game or does it tap a well of ever-increasing knowledge and experience? And what's to be learned from mistakes and games that underwhelmed and sold poorly? This session will ask a panel of experienced developers how they learn and build on their game design experience. We'll ask them to specifically address how their most-recently completed project (or one they are working on now) was influenced by the game that preceded it. If there are rules and conventions to follow in creating games, where do they come from? Is past experience a viable resource or is it best to start new projects with a clean slate?&nbsp;</td>

How are pitches judged? How are game ideas assessed? What's the process? What are the right steps to follow? This session will assemble decision-makers from the publishing ranks as well as developers with dozens of pitches to their credit and ask them to address what makes for a capable pitch in today's competitive game marketplace.
