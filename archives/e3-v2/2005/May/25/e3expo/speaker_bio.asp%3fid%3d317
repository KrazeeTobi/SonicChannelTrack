			<td valign="top" class="tableCell">Jim has spent 20 years successfully crossing content with technology. He is the CEO and co-founder of Spectrum MediaWorks, a programming (content and code) and services company serving the confluent industries of digital filmed entertainment, electronic games and networked media; and specializes in "matching message to medium," helping clients capture audiences in ways more native to naturally emerging consumer behavior. Banister is also the author of "Word of Mouse: The New Age of Networked Media" (Agate, 2004). His career embodies the essence of his company's name-a successful entrepreneur in computer animation, a film and television producer, a studio executive, an expert in networked-media (web, wireless, etc) programming and an innovative engineer working in the area of visual simulation.&nbsp;</td>
