A majority of his time has been spent as a producer, acting as a liaison between publishers and developers, while also seeking out development talent worldwide.  Grant has always been an avid video game player, admiring the art in its various forms.  When he is outside of work, odds are that he can be found playing one video game or another.  Grant founded Infinity Ward in 2002.  Since that time they have launched Activision's definitive World War II franchise, Call of Duty.&nbsp;</td>
