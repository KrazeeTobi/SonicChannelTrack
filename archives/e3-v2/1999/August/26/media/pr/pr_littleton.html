<b><big>Video Games Did Not Cause Littleton</big></b><p>



<p>Los Angeles - May 13, 1999 - Speaking at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>) - the  
annual trade show of the world's video game industry - Growing Up Digital (<a href="http://www.growingupdigital.com" target="_top">http://www.growingupdigital.com</a>) author Don Tapscott said that critics who try to develop a causal relationship between violent video games and horrific events such as the Littleton shootings are counter-productively deflecting attention from the true causes. </p>

<p>"No one has shown any connection whatsoever between these games and tragic incidents such as Littleton, or to youth violence in general" said Tapscott. "But countless studies have shown a linkage of youth violence to factors such as poverty, lack of parental involvement, family violence, untreated mental illness, the proliferation of guns, substance abuse and illegal drug wars."  </p>

<p>"During the past five years, as video games have exploded in popularity and graphic realism, the rate of youth violence has declined.  If we simply focus our energies in the wake of Littleton on popular culture such as violent video games, we are squandering the opportunity for a substantive dialogue on the real issues threatening the health of youth today." </p>

<p>Growing Up Digital (<a href="http://www.growingupdigital.com" target="_top">http://www.growingupdigital.com</a>) (released this month in paperback) looks at the substantial effects of digital technologies on the Net Generation æ kids today aged 2 to 22.  These kids have been bathed in bits since birth, and view digital technologies such as personal computers or Nintendo as part of the natural landscape, and no more intimidating than a refrigerator. </p>

<p>The result has been a Generation Lap æ kids being far more advanced in the use of this technology than their parents or teachers.  Adults often resent this expertise, and Tapscott argued that the post-Littleton backlash against the Internet and video games is an attempt by some adults to take away the devices they find intimidating.  "We fear what we do not understand," he said. </p>

<p>"The video game industry, which is already larger than Hollywood, is poised for even much greater growth as it expands into areas such as education.  We all have a role to play in ensuring that kids' experience with this media continues to be positive, age appropriate and fun.  Parents should be actively involved in helping choose the games their kids play.  Schools should be teaching kids media literacy. And the industry should rise to the challenge of producing increasingly entertaining and enriching content." </p>

<p>May 13, 1999 </p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> keynote speaker Don Tapscott says that video games are having an enormously positive effect on society, and are poised to transform the entertainment and software industries.  Highlights from his remarks include: </p>

<ul>
<li>The video game industry is transforming entertainment including Hollywood and the television industry.  Plot and character development in interactive digital software is leading to a new model of entertainment, just as Sergei M. Eisenstein's innovative film, The Battleship Potemkin, led to the feature film. The video game industry is now bigger than Hollywood and will soon merge with the Internet to transform television. Everything from the soap operas to game shows and adventures will become interactive. <br><br>

<li>The video game industry is the driving force in transforming the information technology industries.  Video games have been at the heart of many of the great innovations in computing, including the graphic user interface, multi-media, and high performance hardware.  With the release of Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation II, video game consoles will become a computing and Internet appliance of choice.  The PlayStation II will have three times the speed of a Pentium III- based PC.  <br><br>

<li>The video game industry needs to wake up to the Net.  A majority of industry executives surveyed recently do not see Net-based games contributing to 20 percent of total industry revenues until 2003 or beyond.  However, networking promises to transform the gaming industry as dramatically as it is changing the PC industry.  By the middle of the next decade most successful games and companies will be network-oriented. <br><br>

<li>Electronic Business Communities can fundamentally change the business model of video game companies.  For example, self-organizing alliances along the Open Source model can transform the industry.  Just as Linux is shaking the operating system business, the involvement of customers in extending game capabilities and creating their own gaming functionality can lead to vast new markets. <br><br>

<li>Most of what is known about marketing is about to change.  Prices will be established through new mechanisms. The brand will change from being an image to a two-way relationship based on value. Advertising will be turned on its head as companies can target markets of one with comprehensive messages and build relationships with individual customers. <br><br>

<li>There is a dark side to the digital economy.  Many people wonder if this smaller, interactive world our children inherit will be a better one. Many emerging issues include threats to privacy, the growing digital divide between haves and have-nots, dangers of access to inappropriate content by young people, and its flip side - the implementation of dangerous legislation or censorship.  The new media has far-reaching implications for the nature of the democratic process, the way corporations are structured, the models of learning in the schools, and our approaches to parenting. People in the industry need to be actively involved in ensuring that technology serves people.  This is especially true as the industry changes from being relatively marginal to becoming the center of entertainment and society. 
</ul>

<p><b>Violent Video Games </b></p>

<ul><li>There is no convincing epidemiological evidence that video games contribute to youth violence rates.  In the last five years, video games have exploded onto the scene.  In the same period teen homicides have declined.  The only correlation between games and violence is a reverse one. <br><br>

<li>There is no evidence that violent video games cause harm to a well-balanced teenager.  For a disturbed child that confuses reality with fantasy, it is possible that extensive immersion in video games is negative rather than positive.  Clearly youth who have psychosis characterized by extreme aggression may gravitate towards violent imagery and content in popular culture.  This includes video games.  However, it would be wrong to develop a public policy of banning access to popular content based on the possible delusions of a handful of individuals. The possible misuse of content is a price we pay for a free society. <br><br>

<li>Game creators should not focus on ever-more powerful technology to create ever-more realistic violence.  Public concern about violence, and market opportunities and forces will take the industry in other directions.  There are vast emerging opportunities to create a new generation of games that integrate learning with entertainment.  This will make film and television-style content interactive, and enable people to communicate with each other in new ways.  This entertainment will be of interest to all demographic groups, including girls and women.
