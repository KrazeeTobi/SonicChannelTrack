 <font size=3 face=arial color=navy><b>Interactive entertainment just keeps getting hotter!</b></font> 

</p>

<p>Already in the first six months of 1998, sales are up over 30%. Last year, the U.S. interactive entertainment software industry had record revenues of $5.6 billion. Sales outside the U.S. add another $5 billion to this robust market. All market indicators point to continued growth, as the fourth quarter traditionally accounts for more than 50% of annual sales.</p>

<p>The industry is steadily expanding to reach new audiences as older adults, women and girls are joining the ranks of people who list interactive entertainment as one of their top leisure-time 
activities. Breakthrough technologies also contribute to increased sales. Next-generation consoles, DVD and on-line gaming all create new revenue streams as they increase their market penetration. No wonder interactive entertainment is now the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. entertainment industry, outstripping even the motion picture industry.</p>

<p>In an industry as dynamic and fast-changing as interactive entertainment, an exhibit at E<sup>3</sup> places you at the center of the marketplace, letting you see what's new and be seen by everyone who is important in the industry. Establish your presence in the market and increase awareness of your company and products among your key audiences in three days of intensive marketing activity. </p>

<p>Of course, E<sup>3</sup> introduces you to the buyers who are driving the market. VIP retailers are a select group of retailers who buy for 80% of the interactive entertainment market. These power buyers are present at E<sup>3</sup> to find the products that will fill their shelves in the coming months. 


<ul>
<li>Ninety-five percent of retailers rank E<sup>3</sup> as the most valuable show they attend.
<li>One hundred percent of retailers attending E<sup>3</sup> are actively involved in purchase decisions; 72% authorize purchases, 16% recommend purchases and 8% specify purchases.
<li>Sixty-two percent intend to purchase products seen at E<sup>3</sup> within six months. (Statistics based on 1998 Market Perspectives Survey.)</p>
</ul>


<p>The payback is substantial. You'll gain access to new retail channels in the U.S. and abroad. You'll be positioned to garner invaluable attention from thousands of media representatives covering the show. You'll have the opportunity to forge relationships with investors, developers and other influential industry players vital to your continuing success. </p>
