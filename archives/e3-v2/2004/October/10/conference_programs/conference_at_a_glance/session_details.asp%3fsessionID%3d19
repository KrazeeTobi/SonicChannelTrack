				<strong>3.3 - Social Systems in Online Games: Don’t Build One Without It</strong>

						<td valign="top" class="tablefloating" colspan="2">What is the key component of a persistent world game today? Is it Story? User interface? The power of the game’s franchise? Customer support? Some argue that ultimately, the social setting the player finds him or herself immersed in is the key component of creating an online game that can sell the gamer on staying with a product long after the first free month, or week, expires. This session will focus on the dynamics of a game’s social system and ask: why is it important, how does it influence the gamers’ experience and his/her commitment to the product, how are social systems created and perpetuated, and how can they (and should they) mimic the real world? This session will educate attendees on the absolute necessity of a robust, properly-scaled, and real world-like social system in massively multiplayer online games.&nbsp;</td>
