						<td valign="top" class="tablefloating" colspan="2">What are the criteria for creating a credible persistent world title? This session will look at the most important elements of a game’s success: the revenue model (including the subscription model and its likely evolved form); user loyalty (with a focus on how to reduce churn and encouraging gamer commitment); back-end integrity (including server functionality and effective use of the live team); and community (keeping the world fun, keeping gamers connected, keeping the game environment dynamic). Hear from developers and publishers on the cutting edge of virtual world creation as they discuss their game’s history, its current state of development, and plans for its future.&nbsp;</td>
