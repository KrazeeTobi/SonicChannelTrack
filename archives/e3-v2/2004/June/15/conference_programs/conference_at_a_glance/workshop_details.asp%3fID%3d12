						<td valign="top" class="tablefloating" colspan="2">How do game designers grow an idea from fragment to design doc to playable code? What are the steps involved in building out one’s initial early thoughts about a game’s storyline and characters, and packaging them in to explanatory slides, storyboards, flowcharts, and PowerPoint? The process is incremental, methodical, and often taxing, but all games are the result of a designer slogging through these obligatory steps. This session will ask designers to reflect on their own idea-growing process and recall the steps they took of overcome doubt, setbacks--even how they dealt with moment of success and progress--on the road to creating their own finished game.&nbsp;</td>
