						<td valign="top" class="tablefloating" colspan="2">In an era of big-budget games scaled to selling millions of units, is there a place for games driven by intuition, originality, and artistic vision? How is it possible to create successful games using an artisan approach? Hear from developers who have gone with their gut and have successfully combined commercial success with artistic integrity.  Hear how a development process based on intuition is valid in today’s highly competitive, high risk game world, and how an artesian model can yield a top-selling game.&nbsp;</td>
