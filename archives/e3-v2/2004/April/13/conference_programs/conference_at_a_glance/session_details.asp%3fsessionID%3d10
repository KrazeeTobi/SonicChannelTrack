						<td valign="top" class="tablefloating" colspan="2">The movie-like graphics, the smooth movements of a game’s lead character, the level of detail in the game’s environments, the vibrant colors and subtle shadows, even the rich and absorbing audio tracks all flow from the combined power of a console’s graphics and processing chips. The current generation consoles and PC have already moved the technology of games substantially ahead of the previous generation’s. As one generation comes to a close, questions about the beginning of the next generation of consoles and PC becomes more compelling. This session will assemble the chip-makers and technology providers who have major roles in the development of the game industry’s next generation consoles and ask them to explain their technologies and discuss how the next generation consoles and PCs will differ from today’s. Learn and understand the capabilities of the machines that will lead the next wave of interactive entertainment.&nbsp;</td>
