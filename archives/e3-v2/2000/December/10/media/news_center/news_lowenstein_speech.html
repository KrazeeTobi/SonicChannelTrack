<p><b>Electronic Entertainment Expo 2000 Media Briefing</b><br>
<b>Los Angeles, California</b><br>
<b>May 11, 2000</b></p>



<p>Good Morning; welcome to the sixth annual Electronic Entertainment Expo.  Before getting started, let me first acknowledge the students at MIT's Center for Comparative Media Studies who put together the tape you've just watched chronicling the history of computer and video games.  My only worry is that the video was a lot more pulsating and entertaining than my presentation will be.  </p>

<p>Notwithstanding my anxiety, I must be honest and tell you that I am looking forward to today's briefing much more than I did to last year's.  </p>

<p>You know the old riddle about the tree falling in the forest?  I heard a revised version recently which goes like this: if a husband is alone in the forest, and speaks, is he still wrong?</p>

<p>There were times in the past year when I felt like the husband in the joke - it seemed that video and computer games were being blamed for just about everything perceived to be wrong with America's youth.  Things are better now, but we still sometimes feel a bit under siege.  In fact, just a few weeks ago, this headline appeared in the New York Post.</p>

<p>I knew it was only a matter of time before we were somehow blamed for poor Elian Gonzalez' fate.</p>

<p>The fact is that we met last year in the midst of unprecedented media and political scrutiny of the computer and video game industry.  Unfortunately, but understandably, the intense glare of the post-Columbine spotlight obscured some of this industry's remarkable achievements.  There was speculation about whether the industry would be damaged as a concerned public turned away from interactive entertainment.  </p>

<p>Today, one year later, I am proud to report to you that the video game industry gathers here at E<sup>3</sup> stronger than ever before.  Fresh off another record-breaking year, we're poised to start a new era where creative and technological frontiers will be expanded, and the industry's place as a powerful and important force in American culture and entertainment is further secured.  </p>

<p>So this year's E<sup>3</sup> is a good time for us to refocus not on peripheral issues that have little to do with what's driving this industry's growth, but rather on the computer and video game industry as it is, and as it is becoming.</p>

<p>A few decades ago, Bob Dylan wrote, "There's something going on but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?"  </p>

<p>I hope you all realize what a favor I just did for you by reading those lyrics, not singing them.  </p>

<p>But apart from showing my age, these words strike me as applying to some extent to many of those who are here covering this show.  I read an article recently in a trade magazine which said that the mainstream consumer press knows that interactive entertainment is big business, but they're just not sure how big and how to cover it.  Last year, it was easy.  Let's write about violent video games.  Well, that's old news and it's overdone news.  </p>

<p>But obviously you're here, so you do know that something is going on.  But perhaps not all of you are sure what it is.  So today, as a public service, and not at all because it's my job, I am going to tell you what I think is going on and, more importantly, why it's important to understand and pay attention to the world of interactive entertainment.  </p>

<p>For this show is about more than how big our industry has become, how many people play video and computer games, who plays them, how they play them, and even why they play them.  This show is about an industry that's more than just games, it's about technology, education, and very basic changes in our culture and the very nature of how we are entertained.</p>

<p>The numbers are a good place to start to tell the story:</p>

<p>1999 retail sales of $6.1 billion, a growth of 15% over 1998 sales; since 1995, industry sales are over 100%.  Last year, in addition to retail sales, another $500 million in revenue came from on line games and another $880 million was derived from the rental of video games.  More than two games were sold last year for every household in America as unit sales of PC and video games hit 215 million, up 20% over the 1998 figures.</p>

<p>The $6.6 billion in retail and online game revenue compares favorably to the $7.3 billion in box office revenue generated by the US motion picture industry in 1999; indeed, sooner, rather than later, video and computer game software sales WILL surpass the motion picture box office numbers. . .in fact, if they'd just stop raising ticket prices while we lower retail prices, we'd probably already have done so.</p>

<p>Over the last six years, one question has come up repeatedly for which I have not had an answer: how many Americans play computer and video games.  A new survey by the nationally recognized polling firm of Peter D. Hart & Associates now gives us the answer:  60% of all Americans play computer and video games - this translates into 145 million Americans.</p>

<p>The average age of these 145 million game players is not 13 years old, it's not 17, and it's not 21.  It's 28 years old.  Thirty seven percent are under 17 and 61% are 18 and over.  Forty-three percent are female.  The Hart survey also disclosed a fairly even balance between people who play games only occasionally and those who are more committed users: about one-third of Americans play games 1-2 hours per week, one-fourth play them 3-5 hours per week, and one-third play them six hours or more per week. </p>

<p>These last numbers confirm the emergence of the casual game segment of the market, one of the most important developments in the history of this industry.  As home PCs have become more ubiquitous, as consoles have spread into millions of new homes, the user base has broadened to include those who play game only occasionally -- Moms and Dads, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors.  Accordingly, demand for a wider range of games, especially ones which don't require advanced degrees in computer science to master and the leisure time of a college student to play, has surged.  </p>

<p>In particular, we've noted that demand for games that are family friendly is increasing.  Hence, Who Wants to be A Millionaire, Parker Brothers Classic Card Games and Milton Bradley Classic Board Games, Centipede and the Sims all appear on the PC best seller list for the First Quarter of 2000.  This is one reason why the more than 400 exhibitors here at E<sup>3</sup> report that of the 2,400 titles they're showing 63% are targeted at the casual game audience.  Clearly, this vibrant niche of the market offers the opportunity to develop lower cost and lower risk games that in turn can be sold at lower prices and in higher volumes. </p>

<p>The Hart research I cited moments ago supplements IDSA's Year 2000 annual survey of consumers, the most in depth look at the demographics and behavior of video and PC game consumers, which we're releasing this morning.  I'm going to turn to some of the data from that survey that further amplifies the computer and video game industry's prominent role in our culture.</p>

<p>Staying on the demographic issue, it's worth taking special note of the fact that the IDSA research discloses that only 3 percent of those who actually purchase PC games and 13% of those who actually buy console games at the point of sale are under 18.  And a whopping 84% of these under 18 buyers report that they receive permission from their parents to buy the games they purchase!  </p>

<p>Is it possible for kids under 17 to buy Mature rated games?  Yes.  But let's put to rest once and for all this image, promoted by politicians, of cash toting 12 year olds swarming our malls and hauling away Mature rated video games beneath the radar of unsuspecting parents.  Let's not mistake the fact that kids theoretically can buy Mature rated games with the reality that few actually do. </p>

<p>Here's another measure of how games fit into our lives: PC owners responding to the IDSA survey report that they use their computers to play computer games and Internet games more than any other application - 29.8% of the time, followed by 19.5% for e mail, 14.6% for web surfing and other online activities, such as e commerce, and 14% for word processing.</p>

<p>The survey also provided some striking data about how people play computer and video games.  It turns out that the image of the gamer as a loner is way off base.  In fact, consumers report that game playing is a highly social activity that often involves the family.  </p>

<p>Specifically, 58.6% of those who most often use games say they play with their friends; 42% say they play with members of their families; 26.6% say they play with their spouse and 25% percent play with their parents.  Thus, far from being an isolating activity, it appears as if video games bring people together. </p>

<p>Finally, we tried to get a sense of why people like to play video and computer games.  Why has this form of entertainment taken off so dramatically, why has it spread from a narrow base of aficionados to such a broad swath of our population in so little time?  So we asked the most frequent users of computer and video games to choose form a list of reasons they like playing them.</p>

<p>We found that 78.5% of the respondents said they like games because they are challenging: another 55% said they like them because they relieve stress; the third highest ranked reason is that games provide a lot of entertainment value for the money; 39% say they play games because they are engrossing, and a fifth highly ranked reason is that games are a social activity that players can do with family and friends. </p>

<p>Those are the basic facts and figures.  They portray an industry which is at once bigger and more pervasive than many imagine, an industry who's products offer tremendously high quality and immersive entertainment; in short, an industry which has clearly arrived.  </p>

<p>But I'd like to spend the balance of this presentation briefly touching on some themes that go deeper than the numbers.  I want to offer you a new way to look at the video game industry, a way that peers beyond size and demographics, and beyond violence.  I submit that while entertainment and great games are at the heart of who we are and what we do, the story of E<sup>3</sup> and this industry goes beyond games.  In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that computer and video games are changing the way we play, learn, and perhaps even work in this new century.</p>

<p>Between 1999 and 2001, four new video game consoles will be introduced.  These machines represent more than just raw speed and power.  They are multi-function set top devices offering access to games, DVD movies, audio CDs, the Internet, email, and more.  They are the first true convergence machines, and they symbolize the fact that the video game industry will be the nerve center for home entertainment of the future.  A few years ago when we were all attending conferences on PC-TV convergence, who among us really thought that convergence would be delivered by the video game industry in the year 2000 at affordable prices?  </p>

<p>Much attention has focused on the power of these new consoles.  But a bigger story is what they mean for the entertainment experience in America and around the world. </p>

<p>As we enter this new generation of console hardware, we enter a period where game worlds will be more realistic, where we will see characters capable of engaging our emotions, of making us laugh and cry, and even triggering empathy, of games which do an even better job of creating the illusion of interacting with real people rather than inanimate characters, of games where music and sound are used not as background noise, but as devices to create tension or other effects, of games where actions are controlled not by joysticks and mouses, but by our own words.  </p>

<p>There are new games where characters already can remember your conversations and the tone you take with different people, where if you act rude to someone you encounter, he or she might not give you information you need later in the game to prevail.  We're even seeing game characters who talk to each other about you, the player.  There are games where characters take on personalities based on your decisions as the player, and these decisions affect the outcome.</p>

<p>All of this means that the game industry will only grow in its capacity to capture the imagination of Americans, and people around the world. </p>

<p>Early this year, Newsweek reporter Seth Stevenson declared that, "In the century to come, the medium producing the most dynamic, vital, and exciting new art will be...video games."  Stevenson said that these games will be "more entertaining than movies, more profitable than movies, and, yes, more moving than movies. For where the moving image was cinema's bold new advantage over previous media, videogames boast interactivity, an even better way to engage the emotions of the audience."</p>

<p>Others are recognizing the same thing Stevenson has.  This past February, MIT's Center for Comparative Media Studies hosted the first national conference bringing the academic community and the game development and publishing community together to explore the role of computer and video games in popular culture.  In announcing the conference, Professor Henry Jenkins, Director of the CMS remarked, "There is no question that interactive games are a medium which can already celebrate significant accomplishments and social and cultural contributions. The most exciting developments are surely yet to come.  The time has come to take an inventory of today's game industry and envision tomorrow's technological innovations and creative implications."</p>

<p>Why bother?  </p>

<p>It's probably a bit early for this, and at the risk of sounding like your worst sociology professor, let me offer an answer. </p>

<p>Games are emerging as a dominant entertainment form because they are immersive and they're personal.  Recall the striking data earlier about how people prefer to play games with friends and family.  But there's even more to it than that, something more basic.  (Now here's the sociology.)  Humans are by nature interactive, not passive people.  Yet, it is passive entertainment like television, radio, and movies that dominated the 20th century.  In contrast, video games appeal to the innate instinct of humans to control their environment and to interact with it.</p>

<p>It makes sense: given a choice between the passive experience of watching TV or a movie, and playing video games with friends and family in the living room, or in real time with friends and even strangers on the Internet, the children of the Baby Boom generation will choose more and more the entertainment offering human interaction and control.  That's the world in which they've been brought up. </p>

<p>During his presentation at the conference, game developer Warren Spector said that one of the defining features of games vs. other entertainment is that "we put power in players' hands, ceding a level of authorial control more traditional media would find appalling."  He's right.  Hollywood controls the ending of the movie; ER's writers control what happens to George Clooney.  But in video and computer games, the player increasingly controls the outcome.  And that is why this medium is literally redefining what we mean by entertainment.  Passive entertainment is losing its hold on Americans, especially those in their teens to mid-thirties.  It will not be as central and important to this generation as it has been to previous ones.</p>

<p>And in a future where video games touch our emotions, where they create characters we care about in environments that are realistic, and where we as players are the directors, what will happen to the passive entertainment forms many of us have grown up on?  They will become less and less dominant, yielding more and more to interactive entertainment in its many forms.  We're just now starting to see games for your PDAs and your cell phones.  Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie will play a heroine from a video game in her next film.  Major rock bands are creating songs, and soon even soundtracks for video games.  The day may come when a video game soundtrack may win a Grammy.  So those who think games are a subgenre of the larger entertainment world are missing it.  They're stuck in old paradigms and are not focusing on where the real action is.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that movies and TV don't matter, or that Americans will stop watching or going to them.  I'm not even suggesting they won't remain a powerful and important form of entertainment.  They will.  But when IDSA asked Americans to rate video and computer games vs. other forms of entertainment, an astonishing 35.5% reported that playing video and PC games is the most fun home entertainment activity, double the second highest ranked activity, watching TV, and triple the rating for going out to the movies.  And those who most frequently use games say playing video and PC games is the most fun entertainment activity by a 53% to 15% margin over TV. </p>

<p>So passive entertainment will not disappear; rather, this is about presaging the full emergence of interactive entertainment as the most important form of entertainment of our time, and the foreseeable future.  Consider this: when the most frequent users of video and PC games were asked what forms of entertainment will be most popular one decade from now, the Internet ranked first at 31% and computer and video games ranked second at 28.5%.  Bear in mind that much of the activity on the Internet will be game-oriented.  And what do the Internet and playing games have in common?  Both have interactivity, user control, and social interaction at their core.  This is the new entertainment paradigm.  And this is what E<sup>3</sup> Expo is all about.</p>

<p>What's remarkable about what you'll see here at E<sup>3</sup> Expo is that we're still at a relatively primitive stage of the interactive entertainment art form; we're only just beginning to realize its full potential to amaze and entertain us.  And as video games realize this potential, they will have impacts far beyond the world of entertainment.  </p>

<p>Consider education.  We're living in an era where we're raising the first ever generation of techno-savvy kids.  At the same time, Democrats and Republicans, as well as people from inner cities to rural areas all bemoan the state of education in our country today.  Learning is boring; schools aren't taking advantage of new technology; classes are too large.  How do games fit in?</p>

<p>Well, to date, they really haven't.  Yes, edutainment titles like Carmen Sandiego and Oregon Trail, and skill building titles like Math Blaster and Reader Rabbit have been used.  But it's still an uneasy marriage.  There's a kneejerk negative reaction to the notion of games as education tools.  But the same trends I discussed earlier will soon start to wear down this resistance.</p>

<p>Nationally known educator Bonnie Bracey told the MIT conference that she recalls her days as a teacher when the Challenger spacecraft exploded.  She built a spaceship in her classroom to help students understand what happened.  As powerful a learning tool as that was, Bracey said the striking worlds created by game developers offer even more exciting potential to teach.  "Thank God for the developers that make games," she said. "You create environments that I can use to teach people."  </p>

<p>How?  Remember the Sociology lecture?  It's about interactivity for a generation raised with technology.  It's about control and involvement.  Looking ahead, with increasing demands from educators and parents, and even students, that schools rethink how they teach, video games will carve out an important niche in the schoolhouse. </p>

<p>That's not dumbing down learning, it's livening it up.  Is there any reason why games like Age of Empires can't be used to teach children about the Middle Ages; isn't it likely that the game industry will create products that allow students, in the words of MIT's Jenkins, to take "virtual field trips to historical or geographically diverse environments?"  But don't take my word for it: ask your kids whether they think they'll learn more about urban planning from SimCity 3000 or from a worksheet?  Make no mistake: video games will be a core part of education in the next decade.  </p>

<p>Beyond entertainment and education, the video game industry will influence the lives of Americans, gamers and non-gamers, in still others ways not yet imaginable. </p>

<p>For example, Nintendo entered a $1 billion partnership with IBM to develop the chip for the new Dolphin.  Is there any doubt that beyond powering Nintendo's next generation console, IBM's engineers will parlay what they learn in building the Dolphin chip into other uses which will ripple far beyond the game sector?</p>

<p>Just a few years ago, the demands of game programmers for better 3D imaging literally helped create a burgeoning industry in 3D graphic accelerators.  It's just a matter of time before the 3D acceleration technology used for games today will seep into the workplace and the home.   </p>

<p>The game industry is also driving advances in the field of artificial intelligence.  A recent Wall Street Journal story headlined "Artificial Intelligence Gurus Win Tech Game Jobs" noted that until recently, AI - the art of making computers behave like people - was a largely obscure academic field.  Not anymore.  Today, the game industry is perhaps the most fertile field for those dabbling in the sci-fi AI world.</p>

<p>And what is learned and developed in game AI is certain to speed advances in other areas.  Indeed, if you look at what's being done in games today, it's not unreasonable to speculate that game AI will be a major proving ground for intelligent agents -- computer programs that are so personalized that they learn what you like, what you're interested in, and how you like information presented, software which will become central to our daily lives, and software built in part on the labors of those in the videogame business. </p>

<p>So when you leave here and walk around the floor of E<sup>3</sup> 2000, take a few minutes to look at the world of family titles for casual gamers and families; take some time to ponder the power of new console hardware; consider how some of the games you see may help our kids' excel in school; try to understand the extraordinary AI in the games you see. </p>

<p>Newsweek's Stevenson pointed out that it took 40 years for the film industry to come up with Citizen Kane.  This industry is only 25 years old and its creators have already produced a body of stunning work.  But there are boundaries yet to be crossed.  So yes, take a walk around E<sup>3</sup> 2000 and see whether our Citizen Kane might be lurking out there somewhere. </p>

<p>Whatever you do, I am sure of one thing: you'll see the future of entertainment, and it's truly beyond imagination.</p>
