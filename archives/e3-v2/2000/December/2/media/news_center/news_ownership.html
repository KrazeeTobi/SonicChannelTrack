<p><b>E<sup>3</sup> 2000: "Beyond Imagination"<br>
THE ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT EXPO</b></p>

<p><b>ABOUT E<sup>3</sup> 2000</b><br>
E<sup>3</sup> 2000, or The Electronic Entertainment Expo, is the world's premier showcase for interactive entertainment and educational software and related products. Now in its sixth year, the show will be held May 11-13, 2000, at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p>

<p>The industry's annual focal point, E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is where the worldwide video and computer game industry launches its hottest new products and deals are made for the coming year. Show attendees also have the opportunity to participate in a number of learning workshop and conference sessions focused on the specific interests of professionals in the interactive entertainment business.</p>

<p>Themed "Beyond Imagination" for its first show of the new millenium, tens of thousands of industry professionals from around the world will converge on Los Angeles to see and experience the latest in interactive trends and groundbreaking technologies in advanced software and products for computers and video game consoles and the Internet.</p>

<p><b>WHO ATTENDS</b><br>
This year, more than 400 exhibiting companies representing 100 countries will fill the Los Angeles Convention Center, covering 548,000 net sq. ft. of exhibit space  - the equivalent of a 17 mile bumper to bumper traffic jam. In 1999, more than 1,900 new titles for the video game console, PC and Internet were introduced at E<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>More than 55,000 industry professionals from around the world attended E<sup>3</sup> in 1999, including software developers, buyers and retailers, programmers, distributors, entertainment industry representatives, financiers and venture capitalists, importers/exporters, manufacturers, resellers, researchers, educators and worldwide electronic and print media.</p>

<p><b>OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION</b><br>
E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is wholly owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the only U.S. association exclusively dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish games for video game consoles, personal computers and the Internet. Association members include the nation's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, who collectively accounted for more than 90 percent of the estimated $6.1 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the United States in 1999, and billions more in export sales of U.S.-made entertainment software. </p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is operated for the IDSA by IDG Expo Management Company.</p>
