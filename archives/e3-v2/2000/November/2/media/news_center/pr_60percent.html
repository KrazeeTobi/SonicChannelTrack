<p><b><big>Sixty Percent Of All Americans Play Video Games, Contributing To The Fourth Straight Year Of Double-Digit Growth For The Interactive Entertainment Industry</big></b><p>

<p><b>Newest Game Titles and Technologies to be seen at E<sup>3</sup> 2000 May 11 - 13</b></p>

<p><b>Washington, D.C. - April 19, 2000</b> -- On the eve of the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>), the world's largest trade event showcasing computer and video games and related products, a new survey by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Inc., has found that three-in-five (60%) Americans age six or older, or about 145 million people, say they routinely play computer or video games, and that nearly half of these game players (43%) are female.</p>

<p>The survey results, which dramatically reflect the surging popularity and spread of video games in American culture, were released today by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the trade group representing U.S. computer and video game publishers and the owner of E<sup>3</sup>. Further revealing the reach of games into different parts of the US population, the study also found that the average age of computer and video game players is 28 years old, and that 61% of all game players are age 18 and over.</p>

<p>"It used to be just the boy next door, but the profile of today's gamer can't be so easily typecast.  It could be a housewife relaxing between car pools, a professional sneaking in a few levels flying cross country, teenage boys and girls in friendly after-school competition, and even senior citizens," said IDSA President Douglas Lowenstein.  "The new face of gamers is a major reason why interactive entertainment is a growing and influential force that's shaping our culture, redefining entertainment, pushing technology forward, and helping to power the high tech economy of the 21st century."</p>

<p>The expanding base of consumers for video games powered the industry to yet another record breaking sales year in 1999.  According to data provided by the NPD Group, Lowenstein said that more than 215 million computer and video games were sold last year, a 19 percent increase over 1998 sales levels, the fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth for the game industry, and an increase of more than 100 percent since 1996.</p>

<p>Lowenstein also noted that, on a dollar basis, entertainment software sales topped $6.1 billion in 1999, an increase of 11 percent from the $5.5 billion sales accumulated in 1998. Specifically, video game sales grew to $4.2 billion, a 13.5 percent increase from 1998, and PC games sales increased 15.5 percent from $1.8 billion in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 1999.</p>

<p>The survey, fielded in March of 2000 by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Inc., was conducted by phone to 816 households and obtained information on 1,281 gamers. The margin of error is +3.5%.</p>

<p>The Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) is the U.S. association exclusively dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish video and computer games for video game consoles, personal computers, and the Internet. IDSA members collectively account for more than 90 percent of the $6.1 billion in entertainment software sold in the U.S. in 1999, and billions more in export sales of U.S.-made entertainment software.</p>
