<p><b>DOUGLAS LOWENSTEIN</b><br>
<b>PRESIDENT, INTERACTIVE DIGITAL SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION</b></p>


<p>Douglas Lowenstein became the first president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) in June 1994. Creator and owner of the E<sup>3</sup> trade show, the IDSA is the only association exclusively dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish video and computer games for video game consoles, personal computers and the Internet. As president, Lowenstein is responsible for the Association's operations and for industry-wide initiatives that affect the nation's fastest growing entertainment industry.</p>

<p><b>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</b><br>
Under Lowenstein's direction, the IDSA launched an aggressive domestic and international anti-piracy campaign; raised the industry's profile in the public policy arena and in the media; developed the annual E<sup>3</sup> trade show into the world's largest and most prestigious interactive entertainment trade event; and played a key role in the launch of the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences. Lowenstein acts as the industry's voice before the federal government, Congress, and state and local government on such industry issues as ratings, First Amendment issues, Internet regulatory issues and copyright protection. </p>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
Prior to joining the staff of the IDSA, Lowenstein served as executive vice president of Robinson Lake Sawyer Miller, Inc., a strategic communications firm based in Washington D.C. and New York. From 1986 to 1991, he was principal of National Strategies, Inc., a Washington D.C. based public policy consulting firm. Beginning in 1982, Lowenstein spent five years in the office of U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), including two years as Legislative Director supervising Metzenbaum's legislative and committee staffs and directly handling energy and securities issues. Lowenstein began his professional career as a reporter for the Buffalo Courier Exchange, followed by two years as a Washington correspondent for Capitol Hill News Service and six years as a Washington D.C. correspondent in the Cox Newspapers' Washington bureau. Lowenstein is also the author of the book Lowenstein: Acts of Courage and Belief, about his late uncle, civil rights and antiwar activist Allard K. Lowenstein.</p>

<p>Lowenstein received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis in 1973. </p>
