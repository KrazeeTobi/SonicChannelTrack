<p><b>LOS ANGELES - March 28, 2000</b> - Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) president Doug Lowenstein announced today that Bob Pittman, President and Chief Operating Officer of America Online, Inc. (AOL) will deliver the keynote address at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>).</p>

<p>The keynote address is scheduled for 9 a.m. on Thursday, May 11, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, immediately following a media briefing by Lowenstein.  E<sup>3</sup> 2000, owned by the IDSA, is the world's premiere interactive entertainment trade event and is open to industry professionals May 11-13, with an in-depth conference and  workshop program running May 10-12. </p>

<p>&quot;Cyberspace is becoming increasingly important to the future of interactive entertainment as the online and digital entertainment worlds converge, and as video and computer games continue to exert a major impact on popular culture,&quot; said Lowenstein.  &quot;No one is better positioned than Bob Pittman to lay out a vision for how interactive entertainment and the Internet online industry will unfold in the coming years, and we are pleased and honored that he has agreed to keynote this year&acute;s E<sup>3</sup> show.&quot;  </p>

<p>Mr. Pittman oversees the overall day-to-day operations of America Online, Inc., the world's leader in branded interactive services, with more than 24 million paying members in its combined online services and tens of millions of users of its Web products.  Perhaps best known as the programmer who created MTV, Pittman has charted new ground in radio, television and cable network programming, the theme park industry and real estate, while building branded consumer businesses as the CEO of MTV  Networks, Quantum Media, Time Warner Enterprises, Six Flags Entertainment and CENTURY 21 Real Estate Corporation. Pittman joined AOL as President and Chief Executive Officer of its AOL Networks unit in October 1996 and was appointed President and COO in February 1998. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Cendant Corporation and was formerly a director of Electronic Arts, Atari Games Corporation, MTV Networks, and Excite, Inc.</p>

<p>Prior to the keynote address, Lowenstein will host the E<sup>3</sup> 2000 Media Briefing & Breakfast, where he will discuss the state of the industry and release new findings from the IDSA's 2000 consumer PC and video game survey. The briefing is set for Thursday, May 11 at 7:30 a.m. </p>

<p>Note:  Access to the keynote and the briefing room will be on a first-come, first-served basis. An on-site overflow room will be available for additional attendees; however; individuals in the overflow room will not be able to ask questions of the speakers.</p>
