<p><b>ABOUT THE INTERACTIVE DIGITAL SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION</b></p>

<p><b>WHAT IS THE IDSA?</b><br>
Formed in 1994, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) is the U.S. association exclusively dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish video and computer games for video game consoles, personal computers, and the Internet.</p>

<p>Association members include the nation's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, which collectively accounted for more than 90 percent of the estimated $6.1 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the United States in 1999, and billions more in export sales of U.S.-made entertainment software.</p>

<p><b>WORLDWIDE ANTI-PIRACY PROGRAM</b><br>
The IDSA's global Anti-Piracy Program is designed to combat worldwide piracy, which is estimated to have cost the U.S. entertainment software industry more than $3.2 billion in 1998. The program's primary components are policy work, education, and enforcement-including direct investigation and enforcement actions around the world and online.</p>

<p><b>INDUSTRY RESEARCH</b><br>
The IDSA is broadly acknowledged as the industry's leading source for consumer, economic and other industry data, as well as information on related market trends. The research focuses on a wide range of issues including consumer usage and preferences; growth and economic impact of the industry; software piracy; and business trends.</p>

<p><b>E<sup>3</sup> 2000 -- ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT EXPO</b><br>
The IDSA annually presents the highly acclaimed Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>) - the world's largest trade show dedicated exclusively to the interactive entertainment industry. Wholly owned by the IDSA, E<sup>3</sup> 2000, now in its sixth year, attracts tens of thousands of industry professionals from around the world to see the latest in interactive entertainment and edutainment software and related products. Attendees also participate in three days of thought-provoking educational workshops and seminars. E<sup>3</sup> 2000 kicks off May 11-13 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. E<sup>3</sup> 2001 is scheduled for May 17 - 19, 2001.</p>

<p><b>ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE RATING SYSTEM</b><br>
The Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), created by the IDSA, provides a comprehensive set of ratings for computer and video games. The ESRB is a voluntary rating system developed to give parents and consumers information about the content of video and computer games so that they can make informed purchase and rental decisions. The ESRB, in association with the interactive entertainment software industry, recently established a self-regulatory unit: the Advertising Review Council (ARC).  ARC is responsible for the implementation, administration and enforcement of advertising principles and content guidelines for the interactive entertainment software industry.</p>

<p><b>POLICY ISSUES</b><br>
The IDSA works with government at all levels to make the voice of its members heard on a wide range of crucial legislative and public policy issues ranging from copyright to First Amendment protection and Internet regulation. The IDSA also issued Principles and Guidelines for Fair Information Practices regarding the online protection of personal data for the guidance of IDSA member companies.  These principles and guidelines serves as a basis upon which member companies can build their own data protection policies, and the IDSA actively encourages its members to do so.</p>
