<p><b>ABOUT THE INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE INDUSTRY</b></p>

<p>The video and computer game industry is the fastest growing segment of the U.S. entertainment industry, generating more than $5.5 billion in software sales in 1998, and $800 million in video game rental sales.</p>

<ul><li>Video and computer game software sales jumped 25 percent in 1998 (on a dollar basis), far out-pacing movies (9.2 percent), records (12.3 percent), and books (6.4 percent). In fact, nearly 200 million video and computer game software units were sold in 1998, the equivalent of almost two games for every household in America. Sales in the first eight months of 1999 were up 26.5 percent according to the NPD Group.</ul>

<p><b>Video and computer games are mass market entertainment; in fact, the majority are used by adults.</b></p>

<ul><li>Seventy percent of the most frequent users of computer games are over 18 years old, and 38 percent of these are over 36. The picture is similar for video game consoles: 57 percent of the most frequent users are over 18, and 20 percent are over 36. In other words, the majority of those who most frequently use video and computer games are adults.  </ul>

<p><b>The majority of video and computer games are appropriate for everyone.</b></p>

<ul><li>The independent Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which rates video and computer games in terms of age appropriateness and content, has rated more than more than 6,300 games since it was established in 1994. Seventy-one percent have been rated in the Everyone category; 19 percent in the Teen category; and only seven percent in the Mature category. In 1998, only two of the top 20 best-selling video games were rated Mature and only three of the top 20 best-selling computer games carried that rating. Of the 20 best-selling entertainment software games in 1998, 15 were rated in the Everyone category, three were rated in the Teen category, and two were rated in the Mature category. In the first six months of 1999, 17 of the top 20 selling video games were rated "Everyone," while two carried the "Teen" rating. Only one video game in the top 20 was rated for "Mature" audiences. (The ESRB's web site can be found at www.esrb.org.)<br><br>

Nine out of 10 video and computer games are purchased by adults.<br>&nbsp;

<li>Nearly all (97 percent) of computer games are purchased by people 18 and older, and 90 percent of video games for dedicated consoles are purchased by adults. These adult buyers may use the ESRB ratings to effectively regulate the games that come into their homes.</ul>

<p><b>Piracy has become a cottage industry that threatens the continued growth and viability of the entertainment software industry.</b></p>

<ul><li>Video and computer game companies in the United States lost more than $3.2 billion worldwide in 1998 to pirates who copied and distributed games illegally, not including losses caused by Internet piracy.</ul>
