<b><big>E<sup>3</sup> 1999 ATTRACTS INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS TO ANNUAL SHOWCASE FOR GLOBAL PC AND VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY</big></b><p>

<p><b>Show Attendance Increases by One Third</b></p>


<p>LOS ANGELES - MAY 15, 1999 - More than 55,000 industry professionals and media from more than 70 countries around the globe converged this week at E<sup>3</sup> 1999, the world's leading showcase for the interactive entertainment industry, according to figures released today by the show's owner, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA).  E<sup>3</sup>, which celebrated its fifth year and return to its birthplace in Los Angeles, drew a record number of attendees to conferences, workshops and exhibits from May 13 through May 15.  Attendance increased approximately 33 percent over 1998 levels.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> 1999 show highlights included the launches of approximately 1,900 new PC and video game titles, giving attendees a first look at the new interactive game software that will hit stores shelves this holiday season.  Interactive titles at the show spanned 13 genres, with Children's/Puzzle/Family and Action genres topping the list of all titles being shown.</p>

<p>"The increase in E<sup>3</sup> attendance reflects the expanding business and consumer interest in the PC and video game industry, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. entertainment industry," said Douglas Lowenstein, President of the IDSA, the trade association representing the U.S. PC and video game industry.  "E<sup>3</sup> is the world's best place to see and experience the future of interactive entertainment."</p>


<p>Exhibit space, which sold out March 9, increased to 536,000 net square feet-or the equivalent space of 14 jumbo jets-from 534,000 net square feet last year.  The last two years the show was held in Atlanta, Georgia at Georgia World Congress Center. E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is scheduled for May 11-13 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> is owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish PC and video games. Association members include the nation's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, who collectively account for more than 85 percent of the $6.3 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the United States in 1998, and billions more in export sales of American-made entertainment software.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> is operated for the IDSA by IDG Expo Management Company, a premium provider of information events that shape the agenda of the Information Technology business.</p>
