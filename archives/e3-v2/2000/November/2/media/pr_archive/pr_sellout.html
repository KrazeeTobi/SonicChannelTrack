<b><font size="3" face=arial,helvetica>E<sup>3</sup>, THE WORLD'S PREMIERE TRADE SHOW FOR THE INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY, SELLS OUT FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR</font></b><p>


<p><b>LOS ANGELES -- March 9, 1999</b> -- For the fifth consecutive year the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>), the world's largest annual trade show for the nation's fastest growing entertainment industry, has sold all available exhibition and meeting space. Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the trade group that represents U.S. entertainment software publishers and owns E<sup>3</sup>,  said today that more than 400 exhibitors from around the world are scheduled to completely fill 525,000 net sq. ft. of exhibition space (enough to house 14 jumbo jets wing to wing) with the latest in interactive entertainment and educational software and related products. This year E<sup>3</sup> returns to the Los Angeles Convention Center, May 13-May 15.</p>

<p>"If you want to see the future of entertainment, look no further than E<sup>3</sup>  '99," said Lowenstein. "From the latest titles to the newest hardware, from advanced sound and graphics to cutting-edge peripherals --- if it's interactive, it's at E<sup>3</sup>." </p>

<p>Lowenstein said that this year's exhibitors will include at least 60 foreign companies and 109 first-time exhibitors. As the annual focal point of the PC and video game industry, E<sup>3</sup> is the ultimate place to launch new products. Last year interactive entertainment software publishers introduced approximately 1,600 new titles at the show.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a first look at thousands of titles and products which will be at the top of many holiday wish lists this year, E<sup>3</sup> offers attendees unique access to the expertise of industry leaders. This year's keynote address, scheduled on Thursday, May 13,  features best-selling author Don Tapscott who will discuss how video and PC games impact cultural trends and entertainment habits. Comprehensive conference and workshop programs allow show attendees to explore marketing and business strategies and key industry trends and issues. Workshops are scheduled Wednesday, May 12, conferences run May 13 and May 14. Exhibits are scheduled May 13 through May 15.</p>

<p>Currently in its fifth year, E<sup>3</sup> is the world's largest and most prestigious interactive entertainment trade event exclusively dedicated to showcasing interactive entertainment, educational software and related products. E<sup>3</sup> is owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish PC and video games. Association members include the nation's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, who collectively account for more than 85 percent of the $6.3 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the United States in 1998, and billions more in export sales of American-made entertainment software.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> is operated for the IDSA by IDG Expo Management Company, a premium provider of information events which shape the agenda of the Information Technology business</p>
