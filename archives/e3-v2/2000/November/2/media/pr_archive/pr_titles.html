<b><font size="3" face=arial,helvetica>E<sup>3</sup> 1999 DELIVERS 1,900 NEW BREAKTHROUGH INTERACTIVE TITLES</font></b><p>



<p>LOS ANGELES -- April 20, 1999 - More than 1,900 PC and video game titles will be introduced at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>), the world's leading showcase for the interactive entertainment industry, Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the owner of E<sup>3</sup>, announced today.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> 1999 will occupy more than 536,000 net square feet of exhibit space at the Los Angeles Convention Center, enough to hold 14 jumbo jets wing-to-wing. On average, E<sup>3</sup> 1999 attendees will discover one brand-new interactive title for every nine steps they take on the show floor.  A total of 400 exhibitors will display the latest interactive products that millions of Americans will be bringing home this holiday season.</p> 

<p>A recent survey of E<sup>3</sup> exhibitors also revealed the following:</p>

<ul> 

<li>Exhibitors will show a total of nearly 2,600 titles spanning 13 genres including Action, Adventure, Children's/Puzzle/Family, Creativity, Driving/Racing, Education, Edutainment, Girl's Software, Reference, Role-Playing, Simulation, Sports and Strategy

<li>Children's/Puzzle/Family and Action genres top the list of all titles being shown this year at E<sup>3</sup>, with 17 percent and 16 percent respectively.

<li>Reflecting the broad appeal of interactive entertainment to a mass market audience, survey respondents ranked "casual gamers" and females as their top two target audiences.
</ul>


<p>"Once again it's clear that E<sup>3</sup> is regarded as the most important global
event for interactive entertainment related product launches, whether it be
new software, hardware, or other technology," said Lowenstein. "In short, what you'll see at E<sup>3</sup> 1999 is the future of entertainment."</p>



<p>The fifth annual E<sup>3</sup> will offer attendees a unique look at what's new and what's next in video and PC games and related products. Highlights include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced 3D technology, next generation consoles and DVD will make waves as new options for enhanced interactive entertainment.

<li>Nearly one-fourth of all new titles will be offered on multiple platforms, enabling players more options for access to specific games.

<li>Approximately one-third of all new titles offer an option for on-line play and 40 percent offer multiple player capabilities.

<li>Hardware and peripheral manufacturers will introduce hundreds of new products at the show, many of which offer never-before-seen technology related to visual and audio effects.
</ul>


<p>E<sup>3</sup> 1999 officially opens with a Keynote Address on Thursday, May 13, by Don Tapscott, digital visionary and best-selling author who will forecast how video and PC games will impact cultural trends, entertainment habits and the next techno-savvy generation.</p>

<p>Immediately before the keynote address, the IDSA will host the third annual E<sup>3</sup> Pre-Show Media Breakfast and Briefing, set for Thursday, May 13 at 7:30 a.m. Hosted by Douglas Lowenstein, the event offers a first look at the IDSA's 1999 Video and PC Game Consumer Survey, the most in-depth study of its kind.  Lowenstein also will address the current state of the industry and what the future holds, as well as trends and challenges that will shape the business in the coming months and years.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> is owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish PC and video games. Association members include the nation's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, who collectively account for more than 85 percent of the $6.3 billion in entertainment software revenues generated in the United States in 1998, and billions more in export sales of American-made entertainment software.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> is operated for the IDSA by IDG Expo Management Company, a premium provider of information events which shape the agenda of the Information Technology business.</p>
