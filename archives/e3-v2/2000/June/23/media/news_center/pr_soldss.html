<b><big>ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT EXPO 2000 (E<sup>3</sup>) SETS NEW SALES RECORDS
</big></b><p>

<p><b>Sells Most Space Ever in Record Time</b></p>


<p><b>Los Angeles, February 23, 2000</b> -- Organizers of the sixth annual Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>), the world's premiere showcase for interactive entertainment and related products, today announced that the show has sold out in record time and will fill more exhibit space than ever before. Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the trade group that owns E<sup>3</sup>, said E<sup>3</sup> 2000 will fill an unprecedented 548,000 net square feet of space with more than 400 exhibitors May 11-13 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p>

<p>&quot;The sales records set this year by E<sup>3</sup> reflect the fact that computer and video games only continue to grow in popularity, with U.S. sales of games showing double digit growth last year to a record-setting $6.1 billion,&quot; said Lowenstein.  &quot;This revolutionary industry continues to race ahead in technological innovation and make an increasing impact on our culture and economy, and E<sup>3</sup> is the only place to witness this phenomenon first-hand.&quot;</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> 1999 served as the launching pad for approximately 1,900 new products, and E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is expected to showcase a record number of groundbreaking new technologies and next generation products for computers, video game consoles and the Internet. In addition, E<sup>3</sup> 2000 offers a unique, in-depth opportunity for industry professionals to explore the most important issues facing the industry today in its comprehensive workshop and conference program scheduled for May 10-12.</p>

<p>&quot;When it comes to interactive entertainment, E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is the world's most important forum for introducing new products and fostering commerce,&quot; said Lowenstein. &quot;Whether your interest is in game development, retail, investment, or writing about the industry, E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is the only show on earth that brings together all the companies, products, and people you need to get your business done.&quot;</p>

<p>Registration for E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is now available online for industry professionals at <a href="http://www.e3expo.com" target="_top">www.e3expo.com</a> or by calling 1-800-315-1133. Attendees will save up to $50 by signing up during the early registration period ending April 7. Early registration packages range from the $150 &quot;Exhibits Only Package&quot; to the $400 &quot;Super Pass&quot; that includes up to three workshop sessions, admission to three days of exhibits, and first-come first-served access to all conference sessions.  Media registration is also available at the online media center at <a href="http://www.e3expo.com" target="_top">www.e3expo.com</a>.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is the world's premier showcase for interactive entertainment and educational software and related products. E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is wholly owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the U.S. association dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish games for video game consoles, personal computers and the Internet.</p>
