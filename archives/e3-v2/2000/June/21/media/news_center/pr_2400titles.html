<p><b><big>E<sup>3</sup> 2000 Showcases A Record Of More Than 2,400 
New Interactive Software Titles</big></b><p>

<p><b>LOS ANGELES -- April 26, 2000</b> -- More than 2,400 new interactive software titles will debut at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E<sup>3</sup>) 2000 this May 11-13, according to figures announced today by the show's owner, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA).</p> 

<p>More than 2,400 new titles spanning 14 genres will fill an unprecedented 550,000 net square feet of space at the Los Angeles Convention Center, giving interactive entertainment professionals from around the globe a glimpse of the latest computer and video game software titles at the industry's most widely attended event.</p>

<p>&quot;E<sup>3</sup> continues to provide leading interactive software companies the ideal forum to introduce new products and breaking technology that will shape the future of entertainment,&quot; said IDSA President Douglas Lowenstein.  &quot;The new product launches at E<sup>3</sup> and the broad content of titles is a direct result of the explosive growth and popularity of interactive entertainment among the more than 60 percent of Americans who play games.  Whether it is families or women, more people are discovering the thrill and excitement only video and computer games provide.&quot;</p>

<p>Confirming the increasing popularity of video and computer games among mainstream audiences, exhibitor survey respondents indicated young adults ages 18-24 are the most important segments of the market, closely followed by adults ages 25-40. Also, the survey revealed that 63 percent of all games to be showcased at E<sup>3</sup> 2000 are specifically developed for families and children.</p>

<p>Action games top the list as the most popular category of interactive software, according to the survey, followed by children's, puzzle and family games.  Other popular genres include sports, adventure and education and edutainment.</p>

<p>Themed &quot;Beyond Imagination,&quot; E<sup>3</sup> 2000 will unveil never-before-seen products through &quot;First Look 2000,&quot; which will identify approximately 1,250 products, according to exhibitor survey results, that will be officially announced at the show on May 11.  Exhibitors featuring &quot;First Look 2000&quot; products will also be identified by booth signage.</p>

<p>Other E<sup>3</sup> 2000 Exhibitor Survey highlights include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Interactive software developers and publishers rank multi-player network capabilities as the most important technology to impact interactive entertainment in the coming year<br>
<li>Reinforcing the importance of game characters and franchises in mainstream culture, more than 100 titles are under consideration for television or film development<br>
<li>455 new titles feature sports and celebrity figures</ul></p>

<p>Keynote speaker, Bob Pittman, President and Chief Operating Officer of America Online, Inc., officially opens E<sup>3</sup> 2000 on Thursday, May 11.  Immediately prior to the keynote address at 7:30 a.m, the IDSA will host the E<sup>3</sup> 2000 Media Briefing &amp; Breakfast.  Hosted by Lowenstein, the briefing offers a first look at the IDSA's 2000 Video and Computer Game Consumer Survey as well as a discussion of the cultural impact of video and computer games on our society.</p>

<p>E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is the world's premier showcase for interactive entertainment and educational software and related products. E<sup>3</sup> 2000 is wholly owned by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), the U.S. association dedicated to serving the business and public affairs needs of companies that publish games for video game consoles, personal computers and the Internet.</p>
