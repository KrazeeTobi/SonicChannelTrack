<p><b class=boldblue>3.3 - Understanding Game Design</b><br>
2:30 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<br>
Thursday, May 11<br><br>
Digital games have been around for 25 years, but game designers still have trouble talking about what it is they do. Game design seems to be lacking a critical discourse that bridges theory and practice, as contrasted with other design fields like graphic design or architecture. Is a general understanding of games really possible? If so, what would it look like?  And how could it assist game development? The panelists  in this session are game designers who in some way have begun to answer these questions. Their pioneering attempts to explore and define the field of game design shed light on the industry as a whole and point towards new directions for
digital gaming.<br><br>

<p><b class=boldblue>3.6 - The Next Big Thing? Business Risks of Integrating New Technology</b><br>
2:00 p.m. - 3:30 p.m.<br>
Friday, May 12<br><br>
The decision to invest in innovation opens the door to stunning success as well as spectacular failure.  Nowhere is the pressure to deliver ahead of the technical curve more intense than the world of PC hardware.  New products must be flawlessly conceived, targeted and  delivered to survive  a hyper-competitive marketplace.  How do hardware manufacturers decide where to invest their R&D dollars when shooting at a moving target?  How do you convince developers to jump on board with your new technology  and how do content developers decide what new technologies to implement?  How do hardware manufacturers and developers work together to reduce time-to-market and how does the industry approach issues of backwards compatibility, API support and prolonged development cycles?<br><br>
