            as the theme of the &quot;Tokyo
            Game Show
            2001 Autumn&quot;. By the completion
            of communication
            environment, the appearance of
            new models
            of the video game machine, portable
            phones,
            and the PCs, the diversification
            of contents
            and the platform including the
            PDA, the game
            has transformed from the one
            that a player
            plays alone to the one which
            can be played
            by a number of people at anytime
            at any place.
            This theme expresses a message
            for everyone
            to play the game together in
            the surroundings
            such as above. </FONT>
            <P align="left"><FONT face="Arial" size="+0"><B>2.The visual design is produced by the team
            who won the grand award at &quot;The

            Awards&quot;.

            </FONT><FONT size="+0" face="Arial">Starting from this exhibition, it has been
            decided that the enterprise which

            the grand award at the &quot;Annual
            Japan
            Entertainment Software Awards&quot;
            is asked
            to produce the main visual of
            the &quot;Tokyo
            Game Show&quot;. Accordingly,
            in the next
            &quot;Tokyo Game Show&quot;,
            the SONICTEAM,
            LTD. (SEGA group) of &quot;Fantasy
            Star Online&quot;
            was requested to create the main
            visual.
            The concept of the visual is
            as follows.<BR>
            &gt;&gt;the main visual is <A href="http://www.cesa.or.jp/info/image/tgs01a_visual.jpg">here</A></FONT></P>
            <P align="left"><FONT size="+0" face="Arial"><B>Concept (Message)</B><BR>
            The character in the visual is
            extending
            its arm to express &quot;let's
            play together
            (let's be connected)&quot;, and
            by making
            it move forward, the message,
            &quot;you will
            miss the chance if you are late!&quot;
            is
            implied. </FONT></P>

            The &quot;future style of games&quot;
            is
            imaged. <BR>
            The items worn by the character
            (game machine,
            goggles, head phones, a wrist
            watch, shoes)
            are all linked by the network
            and radio.
            This image indicates the possibility
            that
            the game may be able to evolve
            into a &quot;new
            active play&quot;, which is more
            fashionable
            and appeals to a wider user layer,
            rather
            than the current idea, &quot;individual
            (quiet)
            play facing the monitor&quot;.
