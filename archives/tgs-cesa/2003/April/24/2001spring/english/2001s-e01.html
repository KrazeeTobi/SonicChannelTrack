The show will be open from 10:00 to 17:00 on all days.<BR>

The venue will be Exhibition Halls 1 to 8 at "Makuhari Messe" (Nippon Convention Center, Mihama-ku, Chiba). 150,000 visitors are expected to attend the show.<BR><BR>

<BR>

The Tokyo Game Show, which will be held for the 10th time on the forthcoming occasion, was born in August 1996. At the last Tokyo Game Show, "Tokyo Game Show 2000 Autumn," the cumulative attendance figure of general visitors of 1 million was reached, evidence that the Show has firmly established its place as an exhibition which is the source of the most up-to-date information about computer entertainment software.<BR>

<BR>

With the new family game units hitting the market and developments in the provision of information infrastructure such as the Internet and mobile phones, the computer entertainment industry is seeing a diversification of platforms and contents, and is continuing an increasingly rapid development into new areas and new possibilities that exceed the framework of the past.<BR>

We believe that the world of computer entertainment, which is establishing its place as a part of our lives, will make our lives in the 21st century more enjoyable and more comfortable.<BR>

<BR>

Preparations are underway to ensure that visitors from through the world enjoy "Tokyo Game Show 2001 Spring," the first to be held in the 21st century, which will exhaustively showcase the attractions of computer entertainment software with content more enhanced than in the past. We look forward to seeing you there. <BR>
