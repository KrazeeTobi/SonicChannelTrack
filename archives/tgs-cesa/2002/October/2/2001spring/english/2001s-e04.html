<P>Of the particular note is that &quot;Tokyo Game Show 2001 Spring&quot; is the 
first to be held in the 21st century and the 10th show to be the turn of the event. 
Under the theme of &quot;Video Games Open the Way to the 21st century Entertainment,&quot; 
the memorable &quot;Tokyo Game Show 2001 Spring&quot; obtains participation and 
cooperation of the companies that was thought to be out of video game industry 
and welcomes a new hardware of overseas company to enrich contents of the show. 
In addition, we newly establish &quot;HAND-HELD Game Zone,&quot; where all game 
software titles for hand-held game machines are showed. Visitors can see future 
trends of the computer entertainment software industry at the venue.</P>
<P>The new hardware and infrastructure enriched by the spread of Internet and 
mobile phones have facilitated fusion of computer entertainment and various other 
entertainment genres including music, movies, and sports. The enriched infrastructure 
has created &quot;Culture of Amusement&quot; in expanding computer entertainment 
world. Anybody enjoy games with family members, friends or person who you just 
get to know through the Internet, at anywhere. </P>
<P>Tokyo Game Show has consolidated its position as the largest domestic video 
game exhibition in which visitors can obtain the latest information and taste 
new game software. In the 21st Century and after, Tokyo Game show will keep its 
position as an important exhibition in Japanese video game industry, which is 
leading the world. With the development of the industry, &quot;Tokyo Game Show&quot; 
will enrich contents of the show further. <BR>

<FONT CLASS="size3" SIZE=3><B>Å° Trends of Exhibited Titles in &quot;Tokyo Game Show 2001 Spring&quot;</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
Analysis by types of platforms shows that titles for hand-held game machines have 
increased its share by 11.6 percent from 24.3 percent of the last show to 35.9 
percent this time. Total percentage of the titles for hand-held game machines 
and titles for mobile phones numbers 41.4 percent. It is not small proportion. 
It should be because improved functions of hand-held game machines and mobile 
phones expand their game contents. The video games are now not only &quot;Home 
Entertainment&quot; but also developing into &quot;Mobile Entertainment.&quot; 
Shift in the trend of game style from &quot;Personal&quot; to &quot;Network Communication&quot; 
is clearly accelerating. 
<P>Analysis by genre of game software doesn't show a big change of its list. Action, 
Simulation, and Racing increased their share by respectably 6 percent, 3.2 percent, 
and 1.7percnt, while other genre of game software reduce their shares. As fusion 
of game software genres and development of new genre are proceeding, &quot;OTHERS,&quot; 
which are not categorized in any, still keep its large share. We would highly 
appreciate your continuing support for the show.<BR>
