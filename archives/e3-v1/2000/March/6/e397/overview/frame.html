Consider first that the Georgia World Congress Center and the Georgia Dome in Atlanta feature over 700,000 square feet of wide-aisled, superbly organized, contiguous exhibit space. So there's plenty of elbow room to let you 
see and experience every interactive breakthrough. Plenty of user-friendly quiet corners and meeting rooms for networking, too ... to 
make contacts, to work the numbers, to close the deals. 
Consider, also, that with the world's most 
efficient airport complex, Atlanta itself is a breeze to fly into and out of. Inexpensive, also, from practically anywhere. Playing host to the world, the entire city has been rejuvenated for last summer's Olympics. Sixteen major newly-redecorated hotels are within walking distance of the convention center. So you can get where you're going and get things done effortlessly.
