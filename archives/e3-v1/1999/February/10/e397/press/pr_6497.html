Entertainment Software Titles</FONT></B>

<p><B>Breakthrough Product for Second and Third Generation
Consoles, MMX and DVD-ROM Platforms to be Revealed at
Upcoming #1 Interactive Entertainment and Educational
Software Trade Show</B> 

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- JUNE 4, 1997 -- Reflecting E3's status
as the world's premier trade show exclusively dedicated to
advances in interactive software and related products, a
recent survey of E3/Atlanta exhibitors revealed that
companies plan to unveil approximately 1,500 new titles at
this year's show, announced Douglas Lowenstein, president of
the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA).  The
third annual E3 show, which is owned by the IDSA, will take
place from June 19 to 21 at the Georgia World Congress
Center and Georgia Dome.

<p>"The impressive number of new titles being released at this
year's E3 reflects two key facts.  First, that E3 is the
world's single most important event for launching
interactive entertainment and educational software, and
second, that the interactive entertainment software industry
continues to be at the forefront of providing consumers with
an extraordinarily broad range of exciting entertainment
options appealing to people of all ages and interests," said
Lowenstein.  "E3/Atlanta takes place against a backdrop of
forecasts for continuing explosive growth for the industry,
suggesting that many of these titles will soon find places
in households across America."  A recent IDSA report
forecasts that computer and video game software industry
sales will grow from $3.7 billion in 1996 to $5.8 billion in
1997.
	
<p>E3/Atlanta attendees will see thirty-five football fields
full of the latest video and computer games and related
products.  This year's show will give attendees their first
look at a broad-range of innovative new product, including:
<ul>
<li>Second and third generation titles for 32-bit and 64-bit "next generation" consoles, 
reflecting continuing 	advances in developer optimization of each system's 	capabilities;

<li>The largest concentration of games for the MMX platform
ever assembled;

<li>State-of-the-art software and hardware add-ons for
enhanced PC gaming experiences;

<li>Computer-based multi-path movies that enable users to
create multiple plots and scenarios; 

<li>The first releases of DVD-ROM titles. 
</ul>


With regard to types of titles being introduced, the IDSA's
E3/Atlanta exhibitor survey reveals that:
<ul>
<li>Sixty-five percent of software set to debut at E3/Atlanta
falls in the entertainment category, while edutainment
titles are expected to make up 29 percent. 

<li>Within the entertainment category, action and
adventure-themed titles are the most prevalent releases at
37 percent, followed by strategy and puzzle at 17 percent
and sports at 11 percent. 

<li>Forty percent of companies will showcase academic titles
and 40 percent plan to introduce creative titles.  The
remaining non-entertainment titles fall into the
"informational" category. 

In addition, the survey revealed that over 50 percent of
E3/Atlanta exhibitors plan to release new software that is
deliverable on multiple platforms.  Specifically,

<li>Seventy percent of these multi-platform titles are
expected to be available for multimedia PCs and 30 percent
will be available for for video game consoles.

<li>The survey found that 15 to 20 percent of titles being
released for the PC are Internet-enabled.  The Internet also
continues to be a key marketing tool for new product with
approximately 85 percent of E3 exhibitors having their own
web site.
</ul>

Reflecting exhibitors' sense of the markets for which they
create products, the survey also indicates that:
<ul>
<li>Eighty percent of companies surveyed consider 18 to
34-year old young adult males the most important consumer
segment, followed by an almost even division between the age
11 to 17 teenagers (50 percent) and the age 3 to 10 youth
market (45 percent) as the second most important markets.  

<li>Over 85 percent of those surveyed believe that the female
market (youth through young adult market) has huge potential
as a growth market for the interactive software industry
over the next three years.
</ul>


<p>E3/Atlanta officially opens on Thursday, June 19 with a 9:00
a.m. keynote by NBC and MSNBC anchor Tom Brokaw, immediately
following an exclusive state of the interactive
entertainment industry address to members of the media by
IDSA President Doug Lowenstein.  The second day's keynote
will be delivered by Andy Grove, Intel chairman and CEO, who
will demonstrate how the Visual Connected Personal Computer
is redefining interactive entertainment by bringing together
lifelike experiences, real-time interaction, and connected
entertainment.

<p>On June 20, the IDSA and Variety will co-host the first
annual International Day at the show.  This day is designed
to provide all attendees with a global perspective on the
burgeoning interactive content industry.  Representatives
from the world's leading trade associations, including
associations from the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France and
Japan, will participate in thought-provoking discussions
with developers, publishers and media.  The day will
conclude with a summit during which common industry issues
such as product piracy and copyright issues will be
discussed.

software industry, E3/Atlanta, a trade-only event, is set
