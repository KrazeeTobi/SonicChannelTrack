<p><B>Atlanta Venue to Host Unprecedented Number of New Exhibitors Showcasing "Everything Interactive  From Entertainment to Education"</B>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- FEBRUARY 4, 1997  <b>-- </b> Building
on two years of unprecedented growth as the world's largest trade show
dedicated exclusively to advances in interactive software, <b>E3/Atlanta</b>,
the <b>Electronic Entertainment Expo,</b> has sold a record 528,000 square feet
of exhibit and meeting space to date for the June 19 to 21 show at Atlanta's
Georgia World Congress Center &amp; Georgia Dome, announced Douglas Lowenstein,
president of the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), which owns
the show.

<p>According to the IDSA, sales figures to date surpass the show's 1996 totals at the Los Angeles Convention Center by more than 40,000 square feet.  In
addition, the association announced that a record 56 first-time exhibitors will
participate at the 1997 show.  


<p>"The unprecedented level of interest we're seeing this year is a testament to E3's pre-eminent position as the world's most important show for the
interactive software industry," Lowenstein said.  "The interactive
entertainment software industry alone generates over $7.7 billion in economic
activity each year in the United States.  The growth of E3 in 1997 is a clear
reflection of the health and bright future of the industry." 


<p>In addition to the record number of new participants, the IDSA confirmed that many of the industry's leading companies have significantly increased their presence at the show this year in Atlanta.

<p>"We are especially pleased that E3 is the show of choice for such a broad
universe of companies with a stake in the future of the entertainment and
software business," said Lowenstein.  "E3 1997 will not only be home to its
core exhibitors in the video game and PC entertainment software business, but
it also will be a signature event for companies showcasing Internet and online
entertainment content, online game networks, 3D technology and multimedia chips
like MMX." 

<p>Gathering tens of thousands of interactive content industry professionals from
around the world annually, the highly acclaimed E3 exposition made its debut in
Los Angeles in 1995 as the second largest (first-year) U.S. trade show in
history. 


<p>E3/Atlanta<b> </b>is presented by the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), which serves the business and public affairs needs of the entertainment software industry.  The IDSA's members include the world's leading interactive entertainment software publishers, representing more than 80 percent of the market.  

<p>In addition to presenting E3, the Interactive Digital Software Association
serves as a leading source of industry information and survey data.  The IDSA
also conducts a worldwide anti-piracy program designed to combat global
entertainment software piracy and works with government at all levels on policy
issues such as copyright protection, First Amendment protections, and Internet
regulation.


<p>E3/Atlanta is operated for the IDSA by MHA Event Management and IDG Expos.
