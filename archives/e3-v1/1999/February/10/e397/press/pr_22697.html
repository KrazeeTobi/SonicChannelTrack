<p><b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- FEBRUARY 26, 1997</b> <b>-- </b>Two highly
regarded interactive industry organizations -- the <b>Computer Game Developers'
Conference</b> (CGDC) and the <b>Interactive Services Association</b> (ISA) --
and <b>Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P.</b>, one of the world's leading
professional services firms, have signed on as partners to help produce new,
topical conference program tracks at <b>E3/Atlanta</b>, the world's largest
trade show dedicated exclusively to interactive software.  Today's announcement
was made by Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Association (IDSA), which owns the show.  <p>
<p>
The CGDC, ISA and Coopers &amp; Lybrand each will develop an in-depth,
dedicated conference program track in their specific areas of expertise, as
follows: <p>
<p>
*	A <u>Game Developers' Track</u>,  co-sponsored by the CGDC<p>
*	A <u>Trends in On-line Entertainment</u> track,  co-sponsored by the ISA<p>
*	A <u>Financing New Media</u> track, co-sponsored by Coopers &amp; Lybrand<p>
<p>
"These key strategic relationships demonstrate our commitment to continuing to
offer the highest quality conference program at E3," said Lowenstein.  "These
three organizations are acknowledged as leading experts in game development,
on-line business, and multimedia finance issues, and their participation in E3
means added value to attendees through conference tracks that are in-depth,
topical, and highly stimulating."

Explosion</u>; and <u>Retail Distribution and Marketing</u>.<p>
