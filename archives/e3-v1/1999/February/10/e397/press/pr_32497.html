<p><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Interactive Entertainment Software Industry Shows Strong
Growth In '96</B></FONT> 

<p><B>Year-End Findings Released by Interactive Digital Software Assoc.</B>


<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- MARCH 24, 1997  <b>--</b> Reflecting the
strength of the U.S. video game and personal computer games market, interactive
entertainment software sales grew 16 percent in 1996, with sales of games for
personal computers up 19 percent and video game software sales up 14 percent
over 1995, announced Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association (IDSA).


<p>Citing data gathered by NPD from its Interactive Entertainment Software
Service, Lowenstein said that 1996 sales of video game software were $2 billion
and PC entertainment software sales were $1.7 billion, for total 1996
entertainment software sales of $3.7 billion.  In addition,  109 million units
of entertainment software were sold in 1996, including 50 million units of
video game software and 59 million units of PC entertainment software.


<p>"The significant growth over last year in the interactive entertainment
software sales is a reflection of both the industry's current strength and of
its bright future," said Lowenstein.  "Technological advances in areas such as
graphics and speed, the availability of a wide variety of software addressing
the broad range of consumer interests in interactive entertainment, and access
to a number of new advanced platforms including the Internet are all reasons
that consumers are here to play when it comes to video and PC games."

<p>"The abundance of strong titles for both PCs and video game consoles helped
fuel the growth of the industry in 1996," said NPD Analyst Ryan Brock.  "Given
the high quality of gaming software in 1996, one can only look toward 1997 with
great anticipation."

<p>Lowenstein said that according to the IDSA's own data, PCs are used more for
running entertainment software than for any other application, including word
processing.  In addition, he noted that entertainment software appeals to a
remarkably broad audience of consumers.  For example, 72 percent of those using
PCs to run entertainment software are over the age of 18, and 40 percent of
people who influence video game console software purchases are between 18 and
35.   In addition, 40 percent of those using entertainment software on PCs are
women, and 33 percent of video game console users with the most influence over
entertainment software purchases are women.

<p>NPD's TRSTS Video Games 1996 year-end data also shows that five million
next-generation video game consoles were sold during the year, for a total U.S.
installed base of 5.8 million.  In addition, action games were the best selling
type of game for all interactive entertainment software, followed by sports,
adventure, and strategy.

<p>"The majority of these best-selling products were first seen at E3, the
industry's premiere trade show, where the newest, hottest products are debuted
each year," said Lowenstein.  "This year's show, to be held in Atlanta June 19
to 21, has already set new records for exhibit space sold, another indication of the industry's vitality and growth potential for the coming
months.  E3 will once again be the best place in the world to see the future of
interactive software."

headquartered in Port Washington, NY.  Founded in 1953, the firm specializes in
