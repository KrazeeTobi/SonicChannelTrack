<B>NBC News' Tom Brokaw And Intel's 
Andrew Grove To Keynote At E3/Atlanta </B>


<p>NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and Intel Corporation President and CEO Andrew S.
Grove, two highly acclaimed new media visionaries, will each
deliver keynote addresses on June 19 and 20 at E3/Atlanta,
the world's largest trade show dedicated exclusively to
interactive software, it was announced today.   

<p>In making the announcement, Douglas Lowenstein, president of
the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), owner
of E3, said, "Tom Brokaw and Andy Grove are helping define
the world of global interactivity, each from a unique
vantage point.  As the interactive content community
converges on Atlanta, they will offer intriguing and
thought-provoking insights into where the global information
and interactive entertainment revolutions are headed and how
they will affect the direction of the interactive software
industry and citizens around the world." 

<p>Brokaw will officially launch E3/Atlanta when he delivers
the 9 a.m. keynote at the opening session on Thursday, June
19 at Atlanta's Georgia World Congress Center and Georgia
Dome.  Brokaw, who was recently named one of Vanity Fair's
Top 50 Leaders of the Information Age, will address new
media's increasing effect on the global distribution of
information.  He is the anchor for the number-one rated 'NBC
Nightly News' and for MSNBC, the 24-hour news, talk and
information cable and Internet service.  This year, Brokaw
is celebrating his 30th anniversary with NBC.

<p>"The future of our society depends on our ability to create
a synergy between what we do as individuals, how we tap the
potential of new interactive technologies and how we
translate those skills into the new millennium," said
Brokaw.  "The essence of journalism is to report what has
changed from yesterday to today.  If you don't stay on the
cutting edge of that change, I think you lose your relevance
as a journalist."

<p>Equally at ease covering the convulsive changes in world
capitals and monitoring the heartbeat of small town America,
Brokaw is anchor of 'NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw,'
contributing anchor to 'Dateline NBC,' and anchor of MSNBC's
'InterNight.'  Brokaw, who has been the sole anchor of
weekday 'NBC Nightly News' since 1983, also is an acclaimed
political reporter and has covered every presidential
election since 1968.  Brokaw prepared comprehensive reports
on Microsoft's Bill Gates for the NBC News Special "TYCOON"
and anchored numerous prime-time NBC News Specials and 'The
Brokaw Report.'  He began his journalism career in 1962 at
KMTV, Omaha. 

<p>Intel Corporation president and CEO since 1987, Dr. Grove
has been credited with managing Intel to a $20 billion
computer industry leader.  He has been recognized by
BusinessWeek as a top-ranked manager and featured on the
cover of Fortune magazine for redefining and transforming
Intel from a maker of chips into a PC industry leader.  Dr.
Grove's E3/Atlanta keynote, at 9 a.m. on Friday, June 20,
will focus on the future evolution of the consumer PC and
its role in the delivery of interactive entertainment.

<p>"The personal computer has increasingly become a consumer
device with over 40 percent of U.S. households owning one. 
The PC is one vehicle for broadening the reach of
interactive entertainment in the consumer market," said Dr.
Grove.  "As with other platforms, the evolution of the PC as
it moves into the living room will make it an integrated
part of consumers' homes and lives, presenting many more new
opportunities to developers and distributors of interactive
entertainment software."

<p>A highly influential computer industry leader, Dr. Grove was
featured as a plenary speaker at the recent World Economic
Forum held in February in Davos, Switzerland.  His latest
book, "Only the Paranoid Survive:  How to Exploit the Crisis
Points that Challenge Every Company and Career," was
published by Doubleday in September, 1996 and has hit
national best seller lists.  The previous book, "High Output
Management" (Random House, 1983 and Vintage, 1985), has been
translated into 11 languages and continues to serve as a
leading management resource.

<p>Dr. Grove graduated from the City College of New York in
1960 with a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and
received his Ph.D. from the University of California in
1963.  With Fairchild Semiconductor until 1967, Dr. Grove
participated in the founding of Intel Corporation in July
1968.  

<p>The annual focal point of the $4.5 billion U.S. computer and
video game software industry, E3/Atlanta has sold a record
528,000 square feet of exhibit and meeting space to date for
the June 19 to 21 show.  The show is presented by the
Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), which
serves the business and public affairs needs of the
entertainment software industry.  The IDSA's members include
43 of the world's leading interactive entertainment software
publishers, representing approximately 75 percent of the
market.  

<p>In addition to presenting E3, the Interactive Digital
Software Association serves as a leading source of industry
information and survey data.  The IDSA also conducts a
worldwide anti-piracy program designed to combat global
entertainment software piracy and works with government at
all levels on policy issues such as copyright protection,
First Amendment protections, and Internet regulation.

<p>E3/Atlanta is operated for the IDSA by MHA Event Management
and IDG World Expo.
