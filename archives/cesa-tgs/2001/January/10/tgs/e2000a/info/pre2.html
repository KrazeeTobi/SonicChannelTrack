            been organized in the entertainment software industry. Under these 
            circumstances, beyond the traditional framework of games, a blending 
            of games and a wide variety of entertainment, such as movies and music, 
            is accelerated in the entertainment software. This will bring everybody 
            closer to games and create more diverse ways to enjoy games in our 
            daily life.<br>
