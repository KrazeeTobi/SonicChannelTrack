				<p><strong class="txt-large">“Finish within X seconds” missions</strong><br />
Like the “beat Uhu to the goal” missions, this is a pure test of speed.<br />
For missions with time limits, if you proceed along the normal route you will generally make it to the goal just in time. But if you explore and look for other routes, you may find gimmicks and hidden courses that offer shortcuts in unexpected places.<br />
<img alt="screenshot_0037b.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/secretrings/jp/images/screenshot_0037b.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><img alt="screenshot_0042b.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/secretrings/jp/images/screenshot_0042b.jpg" width="260" height="195" /></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">“Don’t get any Pearls” missions</strong><br />
These missions require very precise controls, as you will fail if you pick up even one Pearl.<br />
Pearl Collector-type skills are obviously not a good idea in this case, so make sure to remove them. While precise controls are required, this is also a race against the clock, so you will need to learn where the Pearls are, and dash through the course as quickly as possible.<br />
The Pearls are often placed in lines, so they may make it easier to see the course you need to follow in order to avoid them. But in later stages, the courses add more vertical dimensions so you need to use Short Jumps to avoid Pearls. You may simply need to play the stages multiple times to get the hang of it.<br />

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">“Don’t take damage” missions</strong><br />
Even simply clearing the mission is difficult, since you fail if you take damage even once. Given that you need to do this at high speeds to get a time good enough for a Gold Medal, the difficulty level is even higher.<br />
You will need to learn the courses, as well as use all of the gameplay skills you’ve learned so far. Equipping Aegis Slider to avoid damage from sneaky traps should help.<br />
<img alt="screenshot_0056a.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/secretrings/jp/images/screenshot_0056a.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><img alt="screenshot_0058a.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/secretrings/jp/images/screenshot_0058a.jpg" width="260" height="195" /></p>

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">“ Finish with 0 Rings” missions</strong><br />
Picking up a Ring will not automatically cause you to fail the mission—as long as you have no Rings when you reach the goal, you can clear the mission. It may seem that it might be faster to collect Rings as you go, then take damage on purpose to drop the Rings before the goal line. But this approach adds the risk of choosing the wrong place to take damage, and taking damage takes time as well. It’s best if you can clear the mission without picking up Rings.<br />
Similar to the “Don’t get any Pearls” missions, learning the location of the Rings is key. But if you find it too difficult to get to the end without picking up any Rings, you can make things easier for yourself by equipping Ring Exchange, and you can focus only on enemies and obstacles without worrying about Rings for an easy Gold Medal.<br />

<p><br />
<strong class="txt-large">“Get an X-Ring chain” missions</strong><br />
Due to its similarity to the “collect Rings” missions, it may seem like the Ring Bonus skill would be useful, but since the mission counts Ring Chains instead of the total number of Rings you have, Ring Bonus won’t help you clear the mission.<br />
As noted in the Advanced Strategies section, tactics such as using Speed Break to grab large numbers of Rings at once or using Time Break to slow down time and make sure you don’t miss any Rings are effective.<br />
Also, Platinum Rings appear in these Ring Chain missions as well, but they only count as one Ring instead of 20, so there is no reason to go out of your way to get them.<br />
Find routes that allow you to maintain an unbroken chain, and remember to slow down right before you reach the required number of Rings so the chain will end.<br />
