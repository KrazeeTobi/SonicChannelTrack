      </span><span class="text01">Every sound in Rez such as the sound effects 

      of the laser beam or the sound of locking on to a target is programmed to 

      instantly synchronize with the background music. Even if the player mistakenly 

      pushes a button, that sound will also join the other sounds produced by 

      the game in perfect harmony.<br>

      All this will happen by simply controlling the player character. The music 

      will dramatically change in tune and rhythms all during the game, which 

      is just like remixing the music in your original way every time you play 

      Rez. In order to further this effect we have asked various artists of club 

      music to join the production of Rez.<br>
