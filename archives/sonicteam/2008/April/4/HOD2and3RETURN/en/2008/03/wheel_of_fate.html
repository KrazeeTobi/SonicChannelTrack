				<p><img alt="zb05_st6_crystal.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/zb05_st6_crystal.jpg" width="260" height="347" /><br />
The Wheel of Fate’s weak point is <strong>the glowing white <br />
symbol in the center of its chest. </strong>Not only is this weak <br />
point very small, but your bullets will just ricochet off <br />
when the Wheel of Fate has its back turned or when <br />
its wheel gets in the way, so it’s going to be tough to <br />
land hits.<br />
<BR><br />
Because the Wheel of Fate has so many different attack <br />
patterns, you’re going to need it all in order to survive: <br />
speed, accuracy and precision timing of your reloads.<br />
You also have to be able to tell what attack is coming <br />
next just by watching the Wheel of Fate’s movements, <br />
and be prepared for that attack.<br />
<BR><br />
The Wheel of Fate has five attack patterns. At first, it <br />
will switch between Attack Patterns 1, 2 and 3 at random. <br />
When its health drops to half, though, it’ll use its light <br />
sphere attack. When its health falls to one-quarter or <br />
less, it releases its lightning bolt attack.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong><u>[1]Throws rings of light at you.</u></strong><br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_01.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_01.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
<strong>While the Wheel of Fate charges up energy, it curls itself <br />
up and conceals its weak point, so you won’t be able to <br />
get any shots in. </strong>Just steel yourself and get ready for your <br />
chance to attack.<br />
<BR><br />
Once the Wheel of Fate starts firing its rings of light, it’s <br />
time to start shooting. These rings will approach you from <br />
the center, arcing left and right.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong>First of all, aim for the center and quickly fire all six of your <br />
shots. Then immediately reload and take care of any rings <br />
you missed.</strong> If you get the chance, also try to hit the Wheel <br />
of Fate itself, which will be far back in the center.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong><u>[2]Body-slams you.</u></strong><br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_02.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_02.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
During this attack, the Wheel of Fate will approach you <br />
directly, so it should be easy to target. <strong>But even if you <br />
land all six shots perfectly, you still won’t be able to drive <br />
the Wheel of Fate back.</strong><br />
<BR><br />
You’ll have to alternate quickly between shooting as fast <br />
as you can, reloading, and shooting as fast as you can again.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong>To avoid having to reload needlessly, wait until the Wheel <br />
of Fate faces your way, and then get your shots in all at <br />
once when it draws near.</strong><br />
<BR><br />
<strong><u>[3] Flies around at high speed.</u></strong><br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_03.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_03.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
This attack will test your marksmanship. You’ll have to <br />
try to hit the Wheel of Fate’s tiny weak point as it goes <br />
zipping around at high speed.<br />
<BR><br />
The Wheel of Fate’s wheel will obstruct its weak point, <br />
and the boss will turn its back on you sometimes, too, <br />
so there won’t be many opportunities to get your shots in.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong>So that you don’t waste the precious few chances you <br />
do get by being out of bullets, avoid shooting repeatedly, </strong><br />
and track the Wheel of Fate’s movements carefully with <br />
your eyes.<br />
<BR><br />
If you’re having trouble tracking it while it’s moving <br />
around so fast, you could try just targeting the times<br />
when it pauses for an instant, but be prepared to take <br />
some damage.<br />
<BR><br />
At the end of this attack, the Wheel of Fate will try to <br />
hit you with a body slam. <br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_04.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_04.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
<strong>At the last instant of its approach, it’ll be at point-blank <br />
range, so it’s a great chance to do some major damage. </strong><br />
So even if it gets really close, keep shooting and don’t <br />
give up.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong><u>[4]Shoots light spheres at you.</u></strong><br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_05.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_05.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
While the Wheel of Fate is busy making its light spheres, <br />
try to get as many shots into its weak point as you can. <br />
Reload when it starts shooting those spheres at you from <br />
its wheel, and take care of them quickly as they come <br />
flying toward you.<br />
<BR><br />
Because the light spheres move fairly slowly, you’ll probably <br />
be tempted to get in some shots at the Wheel of Fate itself <br />
during the intervals, but if you press your luck like that, you’ll <br />
quickly end up taking unnecessary damage from the light spheres.<br />
<BR><br />
So ignore the Wheel of Fate for now, and just concentrate on <br />
the light spheres. You can go back to targeting the Wheel of <br />
Fate’s weak point once you’ve wiped out all of the spheres.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong><u>[5]Fires lightning bolts at you.</u></strong><br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_06.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_06.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
Once you get this far, you’re almost home free.<br />
At the beginning, <strong>focus all of your attention on firing at the <br />
Wheel of Fate’s weak point as many times as you can until it <br />
releases its lightning bolts. </strong><br />
<BR><br />
<strong>Once it does, reload just as you are turning around and start <br />
shooting those lightning bolts down immediately.</strong><br />
<img alt="WheelOfFate_07.jpg" src="http://www.sonicteam.com/HOD2and3RETURN/jp/images/WheelOfFate_07.jpg" width="260" height="195" /><br />
There’ll be a lot of lightning bolts to deal with, so <strong>start shooting <br />
in areas where they’re closely clumped together to pare down <br />
their numbers a little. </strong>After that, take care of any lightning bolts <br />
you missed one by one.<br />
<BR><br />
Sure, there’ll be a lot of lightning bolts, but they won’t be <br />
very fast. If you stay calm and just keep shooting the ones <br />
closest to you, you won’t have all that much trouble shooting <br />
them all down.<br />
<BR><br />
Once you’ve wiped out all of the lightning bolts, you’ll turn <br />
to face the Wheel of Fate once more. Start firing at it again <br />
with everything you’ve got and make victory yours!<br />
