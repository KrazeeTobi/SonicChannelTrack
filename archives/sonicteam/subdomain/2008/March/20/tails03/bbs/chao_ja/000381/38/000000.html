A special colour Chao or a Chao with a different face does not mean that your Chao is stronger. Any Chao will be as strong as you make it. Use the following guide after referring to Omochao's tutorial of Chao in Sonic Adventure 2. It should be noted that only Neutral Chao exist in Sonic Adventure one.<br>
<br>
Green Chaos Drive: Run type<br>
Red Chaos Drive: Power type<br>
Yellow Chaos Drive: Swim type<br>
Violet Chaos Drive: Fly type<br>
<br>
Giving your Chao one of the above traits as a newborn will make it evolve into that type. If you give it none, it will evolve into normal type. Whatever ability you evolve Chao into that ability will increase easier. This rule applies for Sega Dreamcast's Sonic Adventure One and 2. You will notice that the ability that you evolved Chao into has increased pretty fast.<br>
In the Gamecube, you should evolve the Chao in the ability that is weak. E.g. If a Chao has an E Rank in Stamina, evolve Chao without any Chaos drives and its Stamina ability becomes upgraded to a eDf.<br>
<br>
Animal Background-<br>
Blue: Intelligence (Helps Chao in puzzles)<br>
Gold: Give you Luck (The Jack-In-The-Box. Will it strike?)<br>
Black: None (But affects Chao appearance)<br>
<br>
However A blue background animal in Sonic adventure one is a Random type animal, but it is the best because it will +10 to any Chao ability after a few of those animals<br>
<br>
That is the basic. <br>
Keeping Chao neutral-<br>
Pet a Chao equally with Hero or Dark Side Characters or do not pet it at all as a newborn to get a neutral Chao. There is a disadvantage; these Chao do not unlock Hero or Dark races. But the large benefit is that they can compete in both Hero and Dark races once they're unlocked.<br>
<br>
To get an All S Rank Chao.<br>
Find any two Chao and mate them. Did you notice that the baby Chao has the ranks of its parents? I.e. mate two Chao that have an S Rank in any ability. The newborn will have an S Rank in the same ability that one of its parents had. Then you can mate the new Chao when itfs an adult.<br>
<br>
Chao die at age 5. (Check its medical Chart at the doctor)<br>
Before the Chao is age 5, make sure you pet it really well. <br>
Then test if it likes you. Push 'Y' to change the action, then 'B' to whistle. The Chao runs toward the Character it likes. In Sega Dreamcast, make sure you levelled the Chao up enough to prevent it from reaching death.<br>
If you did this, the Chao reappears as a baby instead of passing away. Repeat this process once more, and the next time it comes back as a baby there's a surprise.<br>
<br>
Chaos Chao:<br>
A Chao needs 2 reincarnations, and must be a newborn again before you start the process.<br>
1) Do not hurt Chao!<br>
2) Give the Chao all the animals in the game. <br>
There's 15 in Sonic Adventure or give it the 21 in Sonic Adventure 2.<br>
3) Feed it to help it reach primary evolution.<br>
Result: If the baby was dark before it evolved it'll be a Devil or an Angel if the baby was white. But if the baby was kept Neutral then you'll get the Chaos Chao.<br>
Chaos Chao, unlike others, do not die... (Unless you hurt them- only applies to Sonic Adventure One)<br>
<br>
Evolutions<br>
Chao must be fed constantly so they can reach both primary and second evolutions faster. A primary evolution is where the Chao will sit down in a cocoon;<br>
a Secondary evolution begins straight after the first. The Chao will not sit in a cocoon this time, however.<br>
<br>
Remember: feeding Chao can speed up this evolution too. After hours of playtime you'll notice a Change in its appearance once more. A Chao will change differently depending on what trait you give this time. For example,<br>
A Green Sonic Chao over time can become a Blue Sonic Chao over hours, by letting it receive Run type.<br>
Try Various Combinations!<br>
<br>
In Sonic Adventure One Chao must be fed if they have been physically abused to regain its HP<br>
<br>
Stat points-<br>
A Chao can reach up to 999 in every ability in the Dreamcast games.<br>
Whereas in the Gamecube over 3000 can be achieved in any ability at level 99, which is equivalent to 999 on Sega Dreamcast.<br>
To get Chao to 3000 your Chao must have an S Rank.<br>
<br>
To check the progress (and Hit points: Sonic Adventure Only) on the Chao in Sega Dreamcast, you mu <br>
