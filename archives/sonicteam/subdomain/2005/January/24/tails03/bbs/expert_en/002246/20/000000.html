I've been skimming through quite a few of their posts, and I must say, their reasoning, choice of topics, and spelling are quite advanced compared to most of the lesser-educated individuals who roam these parts. I'm actually somewhat releived that I never had any chance encounters with them, as they would more than likely- and I say this metaphorically- pound my face so far into the ground that I would instantly reach the lowest of subterranean levels and be utterly incinerated. They'd put even a prodigy adolescent such as myself to shame! I say that because when I used to venture to this site, I'd spam every waking moment, reply to any post, regardless of whether or not it was directed at me, and my humor was quite... estranged. But just because I find them intimidating does not mean I don't respect them. Nay, it only brings forth respect, a sort of fearful reverence, if you will. Just felt like complimenting their apparently staggering intellects. I'm sure if they're reading this, they're contemplating a response somewhere along the &quot;you lack a life and have far too much spare time since you read through other people's out-dated posts&quot; spectrum. Well, I do. What else would a socially-deprived adolescent that has only walked the earth for a measly fifteen years be doing at this moment? Perhaps designing boxes for laundry detergent... Hm. Anyway, their intellects are quite high, and I thought it prudent enough to point that out.
