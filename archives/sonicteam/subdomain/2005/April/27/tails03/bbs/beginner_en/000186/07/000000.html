Claws the wolverine: part 2<br>
<br>
&quot;My potion is complete at last!&quot; Cried the wizard. &quot;HIS potion?!?&quot; thought Claws. &quot;I'M the one who did all the work!&quot;  Claws had just created a time-travel potion.  &quot;Hey, could I have some of that potion?&quot; He asked.  The wizard looked shocked. &quot;NO!&quot; he shouted.  &quot;I am the wizard, you are just my assistant!&quot; Now, Claws had always hated this wizard, but he'd had enough.  His eyes turned red with fury.  Fortunatly, the wizard didn't notice.  Suddenly, Claws got an idea.  Normally, he was very loyal to his master, and would never think of doing anything like his idea.  But, this time was different.<br>
<br>
that night:<br>
<br>
The wizard was asleep, and Claws was supposed to be.  But he was in the potion room.  There was the time-travel potion, right on the table.  &quot;Great!&quot; thought Claws.  &quot;It's right where I left it!&quot;  He tip-toed over to the table, picked up the potion, and drank it.  It was the most horrible thing that he had ever tasted!  It was like rotten eggs mixed with asparagus.  For a couple seconds, nothing happened.  &quot;What?&quot; said Claws. &quot;It doesn't work?!?&quot;  No sooner had he said it, the potion began to take affect.  First, Claws started to feel dizzy.  Next, he began to hear weird noises.  After that, everything seemed to turn into different colored blobs.  They all swirled around, as if they were in a blender.  They went faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and.... stopped.  They began to take on different shapes, for example, green became grass, brown became tree trunks, blue became sky.  Claws felt sick from all that swirling.  &quot;Where am I?&quot; he said...<br>
