I remember back in the old day..... I was planning on flooding and I made an extra account and everything but I had dial-up that time and now I have DSL but it's too late and no one that I used to know comes here anymore except for you two who I was talking to a few pages earlier but there would still be no point in flooding and I don't have time for that anymore and I don't feel like going to the Japanese BBS either and you can forget this stupid post because it's not supposed to mean anything and it's really just the new ones who are flooding and I don't even know why I'm wasting my time and have you heard of the Toadies they sing this creepy song called Jigsaw Girl but it's only creepy if you take the lyrics literally and they also sing this song called Tyler which is one of my favorite songs of all time and my other favorite songs would be Endless, Nameless from Nirvana and Pug from The Smashing Pumpkins although there are a whole lot more but I don't feel like naming them but the ones that I DID name are the ones that just come to mind right now and I like The Nightmare Before Christmas but for some very strange reason I kind of started crying when Sally sang that song when I saw it on Christmas last year in 2004 and I also started crying in Monsters Inc. when Boo started crying and I'm scared of Teddy Rauxbin and I have fire phobia although I know it's important and I know there's a real word for that phobia but I don't feel like looking for it and flooding is flooding and and and and......
