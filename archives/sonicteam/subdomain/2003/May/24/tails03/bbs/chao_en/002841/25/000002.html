&gt; First the hamsters came to earth to adopt food and people then they crash landed on earth which they crash into Knuckles and splattered his brains out. They took a pair of big socks and slept in them to await the day. Then they woke up as a new day begun and murdered some kids that were playing and ate them till they were full and then went to the store and rob the store of customers and then ate them then Kirby was rolling down the hill as a ball being happy but then Kirby turned into green blood all of the sudden and then he found out he ran over and killed some of the evil hamsters. Kirby then licked all the green blood off him then went back rolling down the hill. The evil hamsters then got ran over by Sonic while he was running and then Sonic was so hungry that he ate himself. So then they jumped on their ship shot down Tails who was flying to Mexico to eat chili hamsters because tells started liking eating hamsters after a evil hamster jumped onto his chili dog. So they flew to Hyrule to take the master sword and stove it in their buts to eat it and then blew up from the pressure of the size of the master sword. Then Shadow was wandering what was going on around but then he realize he was suppose to be dead from his sacrifice in SA2B so then he went and died. The evil hamster then went to the president to take over the country so the hamsters beat him up till he left the white house. Then the made their speech to their invasion all over the world but nobody couldn’t understand them because they sound like Alvin and the chipmunks then they was done so people just went back to their regular lives. Mario and Luigi were going to the castle jumping up and down till Luigi stepped on one of hamsters and had green blood on his shoes. Luigi licked the green blood off his shoes and gave some to Mario. The hamsters finally took over the country so far now and they started adopting food and people everyday so Kirby then decided to roll down the hill again this time he was stopped by evil hamsters. Then they made a deal and the hamsters through themselves into Kirby’s mouth and then he was happy and full.To be continued and more longer<br>
