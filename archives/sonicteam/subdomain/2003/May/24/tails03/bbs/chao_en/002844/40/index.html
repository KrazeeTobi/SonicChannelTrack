Page 0: The BBS oepns. I start an acoount called Bob (Reboot), ID 2879. I was surpriised to be one of the first users and have a 2000 ID. Later, I learned the Jap. boards had been up for a long time.<br>

Pages 1 and 1/2 through 5-Expert users flame and flood users who aren't doing the same to the Experts. I was one of the users away attacking Expert, but I saw this when I got back.<br>

Pages 5-469- Times are prosperous. Pages are non-flooded, imformative about chao, and fill up slow because we make *wise* (hint to flooding n00bs) use of each topic. I coudn't get enough of those days...<br>
<br>
Page 470- The flooders come in. There's about 4 of them. Chao users also started pestering me to stop them, so I made a new account, called Enzo (Reboot), ID 4000 something.

&gt; Page 470- The flooders come in. There's about 4 of them. Chao users also started pestering me to stop them, so I made a new account, called Enzo (Reboot), ID 4000 something.
