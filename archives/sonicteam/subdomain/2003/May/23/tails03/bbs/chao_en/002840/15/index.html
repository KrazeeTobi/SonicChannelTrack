About a year ago (7 months), I was having a great time @ chao (and expert). Times were prosperous, things were at peace. But wars have went on since BBS creation day w/ Chao and Expert, and we were expecting a flooding. But what we got was a flaming. Every post was replied to with an expert calling us just about every swear word in the book. I had enough, so I left. Several other Chao people did too. Thiis resulted in a chao BBS extinction. Now that some people are back, it is time to get revenge. I tried resolving this with words, but I was flamed again.<br>

If you consider your self a true hao BBS user, you will help in this war, or at least not flame us.
