What you do is charge up your beam in that big room where you fight the SA-X and then jump up to the top door (with a charged beam). Then, when you hear the rumbling, jump down and shoot the SA-X, then quickly freeze it with an Ice Missile (don't bother charging up a Diffusion missile). Quickly hold A to charge up your beam and jump over the SA-X. When the SA-X defrosts it will shoot one shot in whichever dirrection it was pointing when it was frozen. When he turns around he will hesitate. Shoot him as soon as your beam charges then freeze him again and repeat. It will take a few tries ut it really isn't that hard.<br>
<br>
In short: Freeze, shoot charged beam, freeze, shoot charged beam.<br>
<br>
Then he will start to get fuzzy and will eventually transform into a big ugly monster. He will jump high into te air and then try to land on you. Just shoot him in the face a few times (with charged beam shots) and he will turn into a flashing blue X parasite and then fly away. Now is the hard part. Go to the room that is marked with &quot;Target&quot; on the map and step on the computer. You now have 3 minutes to get the hell off the station. But, to spice things up, you also have to fight a hard boss. Get to the docking bay as fast as you can (don't even bother to stop by a recharge station). When you get to where your ship is, guess what! It's gone! Then, go all the way to the right and a boss will come out. You can't hurt him. Trust me on this, just let him hit you. No matter how much health you have that one hit will take your energy down to 1. Then (this is very shocking and somewhat heartbreaking) the SA-X comes in and tries to protect Samus. The SA-X will die and turn back into the blue blob. Quickly collect it to get a full restore and to get your suit back! Now it gets hard. The only vulnerable spot on the boss is his chest, so you have to get under him and blast away (don't charge, you want to shoot as fast as you can to hold it back). But beware, each hit will take away 100 energy points, so this guy isn't easy. Keep shooting him in the chest 'till he dies. If you have under 15 seconds you're probably going to die here. After about 10 seconds, your ship will fly in and you have to get under it so it sucks you up. You will see the Space Station crash into the planet and you beat the game!
