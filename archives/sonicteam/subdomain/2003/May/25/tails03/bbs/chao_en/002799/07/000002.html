&gt; My life is a boring yet complex thread, twisted and tied at various points in the space/time continuum. It seems as if those ties and twists are permanent changes in my past, undoubtedly greatly influencing that of the future. I will never, in my lifespan, witness the greatness and wellness of that which my life has been dedicated to. I ponder in the midst of my sub-consciousness, &quot;Who am I?&quot; These questions and many more have yet to be answered.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I feel as if I will never have the knowledge, the faith, and the will to go on. The fact of whether or not I exist is my most appealing question, as I am completely oblivious of what is about to happen.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; These people, I do not know what they want of me. I haven't a clue as to why they are keeping me captive in this laboratory. I am already aware of my great powers. Is it that they want to harness these? But, if that is the case, will I be used for good, or for the purpose of evil.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Slight memories of past encounters with the human kind remain in the storage banks of my mind. I remember very little. I was to be destroyed. My presence in this universe seemed to be a threat to the human kind, and maybe others. I have reason to believe that one of the great scientists, Dr. Gerald Robotnik, a.k.a. Pro. G., was, my creator.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I know that I am not a natural life form. I was a laboratory specimen, until I escaped. The humans cared nothing of me; they only wished to study me. I was not a living thing; I was an experiment, as important to the humans as one of their test tubes or a vial containing a chemical. I was not born into this world, I was created. I do not belong here. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I do not know how much longer I will remain captive. I spend most of my time trying to figure out who I am and what I am, for the most part.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They obviously mind-wiped me, but for what reason? What purpose would it serve? To make an organism forget about his/her past. Everyone has the right to know who they are and other things that they have learned throughout their life. Obviously not me.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; P.A.: Emergency in Sector 1! Emergency in Sector 1! All troops ready a blockade! This is not a drill! Repeat, this is not a drill!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; What was that?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; P.A.: Sector 2 has been breached, repeat, Sector 2 has been breached! All units have permission to destroy intruder!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It seems there has been an intrusion. How exciting.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; P.A.: Sectors 3 and 4 have now been breached! Intruder is heading toward Isolation Chamber 364! Repeat, intruder is heading toward Isolation Chamber 364!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; IC 364!? That's...that's where I am being held captive.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; P.A.: Isolation Access has been breached!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Cool. I can finally ditch this lame place. No forms of entertainment. Killer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; P.A.: Intruder is hacking IC 364 Main Gate! Intruder must be destroyed! Search and destroy! Main Gate has been breached! Emergency procedures! All units, engage intruder!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; To be continued...<br>
