Yo, yo yo move out of the way <br>
We got missy Elliott coming through <br>
Girl that is missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight <br>
Girl I heard she eats one cracker a day <br>
Oh well I heard the bitch was married to Tim and started fucking with Trina <br>
I heard the bitch got hit with three zebras and a monkey <br>
I can't stand the bitch no way <br>
<br>
[Missy] <br>
When I walk up in the piece <br>
I ain't gotta even speak <br>
I'm a bad mamajama goddammit motherfucker you ain't gotta like me <br>
How you studying these hoes <br>
Need to talk what you know <br>
And stop talking bout who I'm sticking and licking jus mad it ain't yours <br>
I know ya'll poor ya'll broke <br>
Ya'll job jus hanging up clothes <br>
Step to me get burnt like toast <br>
Muthafuckas adios amigos <br>
Halves halves wholes wholes <br>
I don't brag I mostly boast <br>
From the VA to the LA coast <br>
Iffy kiffy izzy oh <br>
<br>
[Chorus] <br>
Musi ques <br>
I sews on bews <br>
I pues a twos on que zat <br>
Pue zoo <br>
My kizzer <br>
Pous zigga ay zee <br>
Its all kizza <br>
Its always like <br>
Its all kizza <br>
Its always like <br>
Na zound <br>
Wa zee <br>
Wa zoom zoom zee <br>
<br>
[Missy] <br>
When I pull up in my whip <br>
Bitches wanna talk shit <br>
I'm driving I'm glad and I'm styling <br>
in these muthafuckas eyes did you see it? <br>
I'm gripping these curbs <br>
Skuur, did ya heard <br>
I love em, my fellas, my furs <br>
I fly like a bird <br>
Chicken heads on the prowl <br>
Who you trying fuck now <br>
Naw you ain't getting loud <br>
Better calm down for I smack your ass down <br>
I need my drums bass high <br>
Has to be my snare strings horns and <br>
I need my Tim sound <br>
right, left <br>
Izzy kizzy looky here <br>
<br>
[Chorus] <br>
<br>
[Missy] <br>
I don't go out my house shorty <br>
You just waiting to see <br>
Who gon roll up in the club and then report that next week <br>
Just wanna see who I am fucking boy <br>
Sniffing some coke <br>
I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio <br>
<br>
[Ludacris] <br>
Yeah, uh huh, okay <br>
Once upon a time in College Park <br>
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark <br>
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris <br>
Nobody paid him any mind <br>
No one gave a shit <br>
Knowing he could rap <br>
No one lifted a hands <br>
So he went about his business and devised a plan <br>
Made a CD and then he hit the block <br>
50 thousand sold <br>
Seven dollars a pop <br>
Hold the phone <br>
Three years later <br>
Steeped out the swamp <br>
With ten and a half gators <br>
All around the world on the microphone <br>
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne <br>
Still riding chrome <br>
Got bitches in the kitchen <br>
Never home alone <br>
And he's on the grind <br>
Please let me know if he's on your mind <br>
And respect you'll give me <br>
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy <br>
Fuck, have to clear these rumors <br>
I got a headache and it's not from tumors <br>
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight <br>
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight <br>
Hard to the core <br>
Core to the right <br>
Drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton <br>
<br>
[Chorus] <br>
<br>
[People in the background chatting] <br>
Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real <br>
I know I know, I don't even care about her beign preganant by Michael Jackson <br>
You know what we should do <br>
We should go get her alvum when it comes out <br>
There she go, there she go, there she <br>
Heeeey Misssy <br>
<br>
[Missy] <br>
Hi Missy? <br>
What's up fools? <br>
You think I aint knowin yall broke Milli Vanilli <br>
Jay Jay fan wannabes aint over here gossiping bout me? <br>
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents so your lights wont get cut off <br>
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs <br>
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too <br>
You just mad cuz Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party <br>
Yo by the way, go get my album <br>
Damn!<br>
<br>
