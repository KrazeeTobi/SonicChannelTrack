Having a bad day? <br>
 <br>
 There was a case in one hospital's Intensive Care ward where patients<br>
 always died in the same bed, on Sunday morning, at about 11 a.m., <br>
 regardless of their medical condition. This puzzled the doctors and some<br>
 even thought that it had something to do with the supernatural. No one<br>
 could solve the mystery... as to why the deaths occurred around 11 a.m. on<br>
 Sundays. So a world-wide team of experts was assembled to investigate the<br>
 cause of the incidents. The next Sunday morning, a few minutes before 11<br>
 a.m., all doctors and nurses nervously wait outside the ward to see for<br>
 themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were holding<br>
 wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off the evil<br>
 spirits. Just when the clock struck 11... Pookie Johnson, the part-time<br>
 Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system so<br>
 that he could use the vacuum cleaner.  <br>
  <br>
 Having a Bad Day? <br>
  <br>
 The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill<br>
 in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the most <br>
 expensively saved animals were being released back into the wild amid<br>
 cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer<br>
 whale ate them both.  <br>
  <br>
 Still think you are having a bad day? <br>
  <br>
 A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically,<br>
 almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his <br>
 waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the<br>
 deadly current, she whacked him with a handy plank of wood, breaking his <br>
 arm in two places. Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his<br>
 Walkman. <br>
  <br>
 STILL think you're having a bad day? <br>
  <br>
 Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of sending<br>
 pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn, Germany. Suddenly, all two thousand <br>
 pigs broke loose and escaped through a broken fence, stampeding madly. The<br>
 two hopeless protesters were trampled to death.  <br>
  <br>
 What?! STILL having a bad day? <br>
  <br>
 Iraqi terrorist Khay Rahnajet didn't pay enough postage on a letter bomb.<br>
 It came back with &quot;return to sender&quot; stamped on it. Forgetting it <br>
 was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits. <br>
  <br>
 There, now, feeling better?

BECAUSE I READ SOME THINGS THAT MY AUNT PRINTED OUT. THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. BUT HERE IS A REALLY GOOD ONE...<br>
<br>
I don't remember the whole thing exactly, but here I go...<br>
A woman was driving to the gas station because she was low on fuel. About a 1/4 mile to the station her car runs out of gas, so she starts walking towards the gas station. An indian riding a horse came up to her and asked if she wanted a lift. She said sure and he helped her on. As the horse trotted along, that indian would let out a loud &quot;Woo wo wo wo!!!&quot; Sound about every 30 seconds. When they finally got to the gas station she got down and the indian trotted off. The guy at the gas station asked &quot;What were you doing to that indian to make him hollar like that?&quot; and she said &quot;Nothing. I was just sitting with my arms around him holding on to the saddle horn&quot; and the guy goes &quot;Lady, indians don't have saddle horns.&quot;
