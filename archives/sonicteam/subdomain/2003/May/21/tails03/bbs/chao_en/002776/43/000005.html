&gt; All right, to start things off the Second Evolution is as it sounds, it is the evolution after the Chao becomes an adult (when a Chao becomes an adult and goes through a cocoon, that is called the “First Evolution”). After your Chao’s first mating season, it is ready to go to its next form, called the &quot;Second Evolution.&quot; (Please not that your Chao DOES NOT have to mate for the Second Evolution, Second Evolution will simply start after a Chao finishes it’s first mating season). You can consider the Chao going to its Second Evolution as a human going through puberty. The Chao, when going to its Second Evolution, will NOT go through a cocoon as it did to get to its First Evolution. Instead, some of its body features will slowly change (like a human going through puberty, slow changes).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; To get a Chao to go to its Second Evolution, you must give it many Chaos Drives and animals of the same color (for more information on &quot;Chaos Drives and animals,&quot; please contact me).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; EXAMPLE: Say you had a Neutral Swimming Chao that you wanted to make a Slicer Chao (Neutral Swimming/Swimming Chao (more advanced Chao breeders say things like &quot;Neutral Swimming/Swimming&quot; to say &quot;a Neutral Swimming Chao that is in its Second Evolution.” The slash (/) means &quot;the Second Evolution,&quot; so its Second Evolution is Swimming)). So anyway, you would give your Chao Yellow Chaos Drives and Yellow animals (you want to try not to give it anything else). As you give your Chao more and more Yellow animals and Drives, it will slowly change (its ears will get longer, it will start to turn grayish-blue, etc.).<br>
