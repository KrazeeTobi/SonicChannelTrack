&gt; &gt; Shadow Lives on Part 1<br>
&gt; Continued from SA2B<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Amy:Whats wrong Sonic?<br>
&gt; Sonic:Nothing,lets go home,to the planet as cool and Blue as me<br>
&gt; (Sonic walks to the door)<br>
&gt; Sonic:Syonara......Shadow the Hedgehog<br>
&gt; (In the escape pod)<br>
&gt; Kuckles:How do you work this thing?<br>
&gt; Sonic:Don't touch anything,last time we let you pilot something we almost died<br>
&gt; Tails:Sonics right ya know<br>
&gt; Knuckles:Ok,good luck trying to figure out how to work this thing<br>
&gt; Eggman:I know,you press the red button for launch,but first we have to set the coordinants.<br>
&gt; (Eggman presses some buttons and then the launch button)<br>
&gt; Computer:Launch in 5,4,3,2.........<br>
&gt; Knuckles:What the?<br>
&gt; Rouge:It looks like it stopped<br>
&gt; Computer:Launch cancled<br>
&gt; (Pod consle explodes)<br>
&gt; Knuckles:Great,now how are we gonna get off this metal face<br>
&gt; (Inside Space colony Ark)<br>
&gt; Sonic:Find anything yet Tails?<br>
&gt; Tails:no,it looks like there is no other way off the colony<br>
&gt; Rouge:What about the teleporters?<br>
&gt; Tails:They were destroyed in our approch to the atmosphere<br>
&gt; Knuckles:so now we're stuck?<br>
&gt; (Sonic thinks)<br>
&gt; Sonic:We can use chaos control<br>
&gt; Knuckles:To teleport an entire group of people past the atmosphere?I don't think so<br>
&gt; Sonic:I can be in my super form,combined with the power of the emeralds.<br>
&gt; Knuckles:That still wouldn't be enough,we would need at least 3 super forms to do it.<br>
&gt; Sonic:well,we already have me,and knuckles<br>
&gt; Knuckles:ye,but where are we going to find the third one?<br>
&gt; Rouge:Face it guys,we're really done for this time<br>
&gt; (Sonic Sighs)<br>
&gt; (Sonic pops up)<br>
&gt; (everyone jumps)<br>
&gt; Sonic:Wait!<br>
&gt; Sonic:Tails,how long would it take for a small object to enter the atmosphere from the colonys previous position?<br>
&gt; Tails:Well,if I'm correct it should take approximently.......2 hours,why?<br>
&gt; Sonic:how long has it been since the colony was teleported?<br>
&gt; Tails:10 minutes.......you're not thinking of.................<br>
&gt; Sonic:ye,tails,I am<br>
&gt; (jeteson bay:Shadows atmosphere entery 1 hour 45 Minutes 55 Seconds)<br>
&gt; Rouge:Are you sure you want to go through with this Sonic?<br>
&gt; Sonic:positive,It will get us off the colony,and I'll be saving a life<br>
&gt; Eggman:the door ejector switch is over there,when you are in your super form,we will close the jeteson doors and eject you into space<br>
&gt; Knuckles:sounds like a plan<br>
&gt; Eggman:you will take it from there,Sonic<br>
&gt; Knuckles:good luck<br>
&gt; (sonic nods)<br>
&gt; (takes the emeralds and turns to his super form)<br>
&gt; Sonic:all set<br>
&gt; (all of them exept sonic get out of the jeteson area)<br>
&gt; (Eggman throws the switch)<br>
&gt; (Sonic feels himself jetesoned and breaks the capsule,leaving it in pieces and starts flying to the atmosphere coordinants that tails gave him)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadow lives on Part 2<br>
<br>
(Outside Space Colony Ark:Shadows Atmosphere entery 47 Minutes &amp; 34 Seconds)<br>
(Sonic reaches the atmosphere coordinants)<br>
Tails over intercom:Sonic,you only have about 46 Minutes to find shadow,hurry!<br>
(Sonic eagle dives closer to the atmosphere looking left and right for shadow)<br>
Sonic:where is he,I'd swear he fell over here<br>
(Sonic sees Shadow pretty close to the atmosphere)<br>
Sonic:guys,I found him,and tails.......I think your calculations were alittle off<br>
Tails over intercom:Hold on,oops!!!Sonic,you need to hurry,you only have 8 Minutes<br>
(sonic dives as fast as he can to shadow and grabs him)<br>
Sonic:Luckely hes still in his super form<br>
Sonic:I got him,hes still alive<br>
(sonic starts back to the colony when he sees a beam fly past him,only afew inches away)<br>
Sonic:!!!<br>
Tails over intercom:Sonic!!Watch out,the colonies defense weapons have come back online<br>
Sonic:I thought they were destroyed<br>
Tails over intercom:I don't get it either,you have to be carful and avoid the weapons<br>
Sonic:This is not going to be pleasant<br>
(sonic starts to the colony again and avoids several beams but gets nailed by a turret)<br>
Sonic:ouch!<br>
Tails over intercom:Sonic,the security doors are closing,you need to find another way<br>
(sonic thinks)<br>
Sonic:Chaos Control!<br>
(Inside Space colony ark)<br>
Rouge:Do you think hes going to make it?<br>
Tails:I don't know<br>
(Knuckles sits up)<br>
Knuckles:that energy,he used chaos control<br>
