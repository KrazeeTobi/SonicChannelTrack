The Forest Spirit<br>
<br>
Not so long ago, in a not so far away forest, there was a deer.  But he was not just any deer, he was the spirit of the forest.  He looked like a normal deer, but he was MUCH bigger, and had huge antlers, and a bright red face.  His family had abandond him, but they left him a small dagger made of crystal, which he wore around his neck.  This deer had no name, and he was very frightend, in the forest all alone.  &quot;How will I survive?&quot; He thought to himself.  Suddenly, a HUGE wolf bounded out of the forest.  She was obviesly very old.  She approched the young deer, and he was scared.  &quot;Do not fear me.&quot; The wolf said.  She continued. &quot;I saw you, and I know that you are the chosen one.&quot; The deer was suprised. &quot;Chosen one?&quot; he asked. &quot;Chosen for what?&quot;  The wolf smiled. &quot;Chosen to be the next forest spirit.  I am the old forest spirit, and I'm getting ready to retire.  You'd be a perfect replacment, I can tell.&quot; The deer wasn't scared anymore. &quot;What do I do?&quot; he asked. &quot;Simple.&quot; said the wolf. &quot;you must make sure that no-one destroyes this forest, and you also control life and death.&quot; &quot;Life and death?  Wow... That sounds hard.&quot; Said the deer.  This made the wolf laugh. &quot;HAHAHAHAHA!!&quot; She said. &quot;You don't have to worry about that.  When you become the forest spirit, yoy get all sorts of powers.&quot; The deer was getting exited. &quot;Powers?  What kinds of powers?&quot; He asked.  &quot;Oh, all kinds.  Don't worry, you'll know how to use them.&quot; Said the wolf.  &quot;Okay, I'll do it!&quot; Cried the deer.  &quot;Okay.&quot; said the wolf. &quot;Don't move.&quot; She started mumbling weird words, and a cloud of purple smoke appeared around the deer!  When the smoke cleared, the deer had beutiful golden fur instead of dull brown fur.  Also, his antlers got HUGE!!!!!!! &quot;You are now the forest spirit.&quot; said the wolf. &quot;Tell me, what is your name?&quot; That's when the deer remembered.  He didn't have a name!  &quot;I don't have one...&quot; he said.  &quot;No name?  Well, we'll have to think of one for you..... How about.... Shishi Gami?&quot; Asked the wolf.  The deer liked the sound of it.  &quot;Okay.&quot; He said. &quot;Shishi Gami it is.&quot; So, the new forest spirit walked off into the forest.<br>
<br>
The End<br>

Note: This is a true story.  It's my story.
