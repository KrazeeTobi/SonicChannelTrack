   It was a sunny afternoon when the ninjas attacked...wait wrong story.....AHA....Ok....It was a sunny afternoon, the type for murder. I walked into the day care and saw everyone's chaos helpless and...vulnerable. I took out my trusty skinning knife and sliced a chaos halo in half, instantly it fell to the ground, dead. I got excited and anxious so I hid the body in a brown bag. Then I saw all the owners coming down the stairs fully armed with rocket launchers and USP. They hadn't noticed a thing until the cry went out after realized a Chao was missing. Everyone was cautious...guarding their own chaos. I slowly crept over to Plasma Kirby's Chao and slit the throat and smeared my knife. Plasma Kirby was clueless and devastated. I acted normal like everyone else until someone noticed my blood-smeared knife behind my back. He said &quot;What's all this blood doing on the floor...hey...wait a minute...SnakeEyes, what's that behind your back...&quot; <br>
<br>
(To be continued)<br>
<br>
<br>
I said &quot;What knife...&quot; and threw it across the room so no one would notice but coincedentally the knife went straight through another Chao's head. I started walking slowly away and everyone was getting suspicious and curious. I took out the grenade in my pocket and threw it. It landed right on Plasma Kirby and killed Solid Snake's Chao. There was a sudden explosion and screams of little chaos burning in flames and then silence, except for some groans. The room was covered...blood, dust, and guilt. Not to mention the body parts...eew. How I longed to be back at my Game Cube doing the simulator. I tried to put all the chaos inside my bag before anyone would notice. The bag I held was smeared with hatred, destruction, murder, and mourn. Before I started running there was a sudden sting and a lot of pain in my foot. I looked down to see...<br>
<br>
(To be continued)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The burning flame on my foot was enough to make anyone scream. I looked back and saw someone. He had a flamethrower lit and ready when he said, &quot;You're not going anywhere, punk&quot; He aimed his flamethrower at my head. I took out my dry ice and shoved it into his face. He held back and started screaming. At that two other people were searching for chaos, one person shot off a handle of a door and found a crying, sweating Chao filled with frustration and confusion. I started running for my top secret helicopter equipped with apocalypse missle and air-conditioning. I got in and started flying when all of a sudden several missles were flying at me and the struggling bag. My helicopter blew up with me and the Chao hostages in the bag that they hadn't noticed until it came down with burnt skulls and flaming bodies no longer struggling. That was the end of SnakeEyes's evil.....or was it? DUNDUNDUN!<br>
<br>
THE END?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Later after the horrible murders of the cute little chaos...Solid Snake was arrested for being accused of stealing chickens from local farmers then later on died at Special Ed. Very sad... As for the rest of the chaos and saviors, a nuclear bomb exploded wiping out perculiarly only the Chao day care center. The heroes will be forgotten along with the chaos. Most think the murderer has been killed but he is still out there.....scheming for his next attack. Mourners visiting the graves saying 'I S U C K' brought no depression or mourn for the dead. This was 13 'o clock news, I'm Joe Bob, good night.<br>
