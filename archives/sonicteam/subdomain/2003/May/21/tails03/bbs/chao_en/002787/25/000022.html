      After one of my mercenary jobs, I became weak and stumbled into the city, looking for a medic of some sort.  I thought to myself, if people saw me and saw what I was like, think of what they'd do!  I could end up in a laboratory again!  So I hid in the alleys, hoping the pain would blow over.  I felt as if my head would split.  I fell asleep and woke up in a bed.  I looked at myself in a mirror as a different person.  I was a human.  I went back into my room and saw a Calumon.  I remember.  Calumon and I were one to create the Demi-Human Cyanalu.  What happened to bring me to the one planet where?  I must have been first fused there.  The world returned to normal for me until school hit.  I entered class knowing few of my classmates.  I felt weird.  The information from the lessons from the past couple of weeks was blurry to me.  Maybe fusion depletes a part of my unnecessary memory.  I didn't care, as long I had my Digimon and my girlfriend.  Thank god I remembered my girlfriend's name, she'd probably dump me if I didn’t, my best friend's name and some others.  But I had to re-learn the others.  It felt embarrassing but at the same time, cool.  I had a second chance to redeem myself and keep out all the other embarrassing experiences with those people.  And Calumon's memory was as bleak as mine, which might or might not be good.  I watched the school news, only remembering one person, who I thought of as a rival.  With what I went through, that's a miracle.  I went into class with a blank mind.  I remembered who I sat next to, Abby and Julie.  I sat down and looked at Mrs. Catania, my social studies teacher, blankly, wide-eyed and scared that I'd be called on for a question.  <br>
          &quot;Hey, Ryan!&quot; said the perky Mrs. Catania, &quot;Where’ve ya been these two weeks?&quot; <br>
 I held back my gasp at the statement.  &quot;I was gone for two weeks?&quot; <br>
          &quot;Yeah...&quot; <br>
          &quot;Oh yeah!  I was on a much needed vacation!&quot; <br>
          &quot;Well, I believe that's the longest allotted amount of time to take off for a vacation.  Besides, don'tcha know that we miss you?&quot;<br>
          &quot;I won't miss anymore days, Mrs. Catania.&quot;  <br>
I sat down afterwards for class.  Luckily, all that class, we took notes, and just a tiny bit of questions, like two or three.  I instantly became happy because of not being embarrassed, but not for long.  I had science next and Mr. Balest asks a lot of questions.  I gulped and walked in the room.  I vaguely remembered where I sat.  Lauren, the person I sat next to, helped me out, but she didn't get suspicious of my loss of memory.  Mr. Balest had little cards shuffled with numbers on them and whenever he asks a question, he picks the top one off and calls on the person with that designated number, according to his class list.  I almost got called on, the numbers adjacent to mine had to answer, but then again I didn't know what number I was.  I got through the class, without having to answer any questions, not listening because I knew Calumon and I would fuse again soon so why bother trying to learn any more!?
