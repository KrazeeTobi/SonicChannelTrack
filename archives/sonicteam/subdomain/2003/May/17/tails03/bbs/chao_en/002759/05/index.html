(Sorry Knower of Chaos, I'll have to write in Eggman's lines for this one scene)<br>
<br>
   Rouge is about to set off to find some more emeralds, when Eggman rushes to her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rouge...wait...&quot; he says breathlessly. He had obviously ran quite a ways, to tell her information.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it, Dr. Eggman?&quot; Rouge asked curiously. &quot;Is everything...okay?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect,&quot; he grins.<br>
<br>
Rouge looks at him sceptically. &quot;...Huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know that knucklehead who happens to be your rival?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rouge nodds. &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br>
<br>
Eggman looks at her with excitement. &quot;It turns out he's been kidnapped by someone!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rouge looks worried for a brief moment, but quickly shakes it off. &quot;By who?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Eggman says. &quot;But who cares?&quot; he starts to laugh evilly. &quot;You have no competition now! Getting the emeralds will be one hunderd times easier!&quot; he resumes laughing.<br>
<br>
Rouge fakes an evil laugh. &quot;Perfect,&quot; she says a little hesitantly.<br>
<br>
Eggman stops his laughing, and glares at her curiously. &quot;Is everything alright, bat girl?&quot;<br>
<br>
Rouge nodds. &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eggman grins, before walking away. &quot;Just thought you'd love to know!&quot;<br>
<br>
Rouge frowns, the minute he is out of sight and hearing range. &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; she says with a worried tone. &quot;I don't know if Knuckles is alright...&quot; she catches herself. &quot;Not that I care, or anything. But...I guess I should go tell his little friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rouge runs off to find Sonic, Tails and Amy.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What is it, Dr. Eggman?&quot; Rouge asked curiously. &quot;Is everything...okay?&quot; <br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I don't know,&quot; Eggman says. &quot;But who cares?&quot; he starts to laugh evilly. &quot;You have no competition now! Getting the emeralds will be one hunderd times easier!&quot; he resumes laughing.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rouge fakes an evil laugh. &quot;Perfect,&quot; she says a little hesitantly.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
