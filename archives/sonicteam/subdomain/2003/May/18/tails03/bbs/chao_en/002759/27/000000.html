Amy, Tails, Sonic and Tikal all ran back to Eggman's base. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; Amy asked Sonic, curiously.<br>
<br>
&quot;You guys wait out here...I'll go get Rouge.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Rouge? Why Rouge?&quot; Amy asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because she'll be able to help us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot; Amy asked.<br>
<br>
Sonic looked a little frusterated. &quot;I'll explain later, okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy frowned a little. &quot;You don't need to get all personal about it,&quot; she said angrily.<br>
<br>
Sonic ignored her last comment, before he turned to the others. &quot;You guys wait out here. I'll go get bat girl, and then we can go save Knuckles.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, but how are you going to get in?&quot; Tails asked Sonic. &quot;The place is swarming with guards!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Guards, Smards,&quot; Sonic waved his hand lazily, before running in the front door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sonic!&quot; Amy called after Sonic in a worried tone, but Sonic couldn't hear her because he was already in the building.<br>
<br>
&quot;I still don't see why we have to get Rouge,&quot; Amy said, confused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because Rouge can help us find Knuckles. They have a lot in common, Amy. They're both treasure hunters, and she might know some more information.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy frowned. &quot;I guess...&quot; she said hesitantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Plus, Rouge has the Chaos Emerald power, from all of her collected emeralds,&quot; Tikal added with a smile. &quot;So maybe she can use her Chaos powers to transport us to where Knuckles is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tails nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Sonic came bursting out of the doors, with Rouge in tow.<br>
<br>
&quot;You continue to amaze me, Sonic,&quot; Tails said with a grin. He still didn't know how Sonic managed to get through all of the guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sonic!&quot; Amy hugged him, and Sonic blushed a bit, as he shook her off. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oo,&quot; Rouge teased. &quot;Looks like Mr. Hero has a little girlfriend!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's not my girlfriend!&quot; Sonic retorted with a blush. Amy giggled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sure,&quot; Rouge said slyly, with her eyes half open in suspicion. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well you like Knuckles,&quot; Sonic said. Rouge's eyes widened a bit, but she shook it off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would I like the knucklehead?&quot; she asked hautily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh puh-lease,&quot; Sonic said slyly. &quot;You've always likes Knuckles!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; Tikal said. &quot;We can sort out our feelings later, guys, Knuckles needs us!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right!&quot; Tails agreed. Sonic and Rouge exchanged angry glances of 'I'll keep my eye on you.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Rouge,&quot; Tails turned to her. &quot;Use your Chaos power to transport us to him, okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My Chaos power?&quot; she questioned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, you don't collect emeralds because you feel like it,&quot; Sonic snorted, and Rouge frowned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; she said, &quot;the things I do for you, Knuckles,&quot; she muttered to herself, before she closed her eyes and a large shimering ball (looks similar to the &quot;Mystic Melody&quot; ball) engulfed them, and when they opened their eyes, they were in a dark, cold place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we?&quot; Amy asked, clutching onto Sonic's hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Sonic said in confusion.<br>
<br>
