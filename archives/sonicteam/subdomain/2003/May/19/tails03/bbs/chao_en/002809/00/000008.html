&gt; &gt; &gt; Please take note that thsi list assumes that you are just now going through the game and that you have not already beat the game and are going back to get all of the Items.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sector 2 Tanks<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Missile Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: Bombs<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: Right of Data Room<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; After downloading the Bombs, go right until you get to the wall of the square room. There is a ledge sticking out. Jump to the ledge, and then place a bombe, then another, and then one last bomb to blow your way through the weak wall. In the next room you should have no trouble finding the Missile Tank.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Missile Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: Morph Ball, Bombs<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: 2x3 room after navigating through narrow paths.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you enter the room through the top-left corner there will be an X-Larvae on the ceiling and a flying bug. Then, if you go right a little, you will notice a thin section of the floor. Bomb it, fall through, go left, stand on the thin floor, fall through, and then dispose of the blue X-Larvae. I want to warn you, though, that the blue X-Larvae is one of the toughest non-boss enemies in the game. It takes 12 missiles to kill, or 30 shots from your Beam. Dispose of it however you feel necessary then go to the right. You will see a ledge with a block on it. Stand against the ledge, with your feet still on the ground, and drop a bomb to reveal a passage. Roll right and you will fall through a Pit block. The Missile Tank is on the left. To get out stand where the Missile Tank was and shoot up at the ceiling to open an exit.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Energy Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: None<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: Square, blue room after second Save Room.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Take the 3rd door up on the right. Keep going right until you end up in a blue room with two red X-Larvae and the Energy Tank on the right.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Missile Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: Hi-Jump<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: Big room with pool; 3rd door up on the left.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Head to the 3rd door up on the left (the door left of the previous room). When you enter jump up and hang on the ceiling. Head left to find the Missile Tank.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Missile Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: Bombs<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: 1x2 room connecting main room to the tall, vertical shaft.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; After getting to the top of the tall vertical shaft head right, through the small room, then into a room that has two ledges and an X-Jumper. Destroy the jumper, then jump to the left ledge, then to the right ledge. But instead of jumping off the right ledge push UP to roll into a ball. Drop a bomb against the right wall to open a hole to another Missile Tank.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Missile Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: Bombs, Ball Jump<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: Room connected to main room blocked by blue door.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the main room there is a 1x1 room blocked by a blue door. It is the first door on the right of the main room. Go into the room, exterminate the X-Urchins, then roll into a ball against the right wall. Ball Jump as high as you can and place a bomb. You will blow open a hole. Jump into that hole and place another bomb to open a path to another Missile Tank.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Item: Missile Tank<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Requirements: Hi-Jump<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Location: 2x1 room under Save and Recharge rooms.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Under the Save Room is a little room that is two units long. Enter to find 2 flying enemies, two X-Plant Pillars, and a Missile Tank at the end. The only tip I can give you is to jump over the X-Plant Pillars and try not to get hit. Once you get to the left side you will find another Missile Tank.<br>
