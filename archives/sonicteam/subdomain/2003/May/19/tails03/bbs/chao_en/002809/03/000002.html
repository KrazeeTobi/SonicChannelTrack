&gt; Nearly two years after 3-month-old Dominic J. Naples III suddenly suffered seizures, lapsed into a coma and died, Fairfax County authorities have charged his home day-care provider with felony murder and child neglect, alleging that the infant was shaken to death.<br>
&gt; But the horror that Dominic's parents felt May 15, 2001, when they saw him lying in intensive care at Inova Fairfax Hospital has turned into outrage at a system that took 21 months before seeking an arrest.<br>
&gt; &quot;Here we want justice,&quot; said the baby's father, Dominic Naples Jr., &quot;and the people who are supposed to deliver it aren't doing it.&quot;<br>
&gt; The infant was in his second day with child-care provider Sharon M. Sundloff, 39, at her home near Lake Barcroft when he suffered the seizures. Sundloff has declined to comment, but her attorney said she had no part in Dominic's death. &quot;It's a very sad event, and we have a great deal of sympathy for the family's loss, but she had no responsibility for it,&quot; attorney Marvin Miller said. Sundloff, whose day-care license is suspended, is scheduled to make her first court appearance at an arraignment today.<br>
&gt; The charges mark a welcome turn in the case for the child's parents, who say their contact with police, prosecutors, state medical examiners and the county department responsible for protecting children only added to their grief.<br>
&gt; &quot;The county and state officials have all mishandled this case from the get-go,&quot; Dominic Naples said. &quot;They've all contributed to this -- the cops, the medical examiner, Family Services -- and they wouldn't keep us informed.&quot;<br>
&gt; After the baby's death May 26, 2001, the state medical examiner's office in Fairfax took 11 months before ruling the event a homicide. Although doctors in the hospital's emergency room told the parents that Dominic had been severely shaken, a pathologist in the medical examiner's office initially told police he thought the baby died a natural death, investigators said.<br>
&gt; Without a final ruling, Fairfax's Department of Family Services reinstated Sundloff's license to provide in-home day care that September, and she continued to care for children for several months. It is not clear when her license was suspended again.<br>
&gt; Dominic's parents say Fairfax police and prosecutors lost interest in their son's case and wouldn't return phone calls -- a claim the police and prosecutors dispute. Investigators say they, too, were hamstrung by the indecisiveness of the medical examiner's office, particularly the lead pathologist on the case, Aleksandar V. Milovanovic.<br>
