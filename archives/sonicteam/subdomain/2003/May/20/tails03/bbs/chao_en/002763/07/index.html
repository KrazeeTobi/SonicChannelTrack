Shadow lives on Part 2<br>
<br>
(Outside Space Colony Ark:Shadows Atmosphere entery 47 Minutes &amp; 34 Seconds)<br>
(Sonic reaches the atmosphere coordinants)<br>
Tails over intercom:Sonic,you only have about 46 Minutes to find shadow,hurry!<br>
(Sonic eagle dives closer to the atmosphere looking left and right for shadow)<br>
Sonic:where is he,I'd swear he fell over here<br>
(Sonic sees Shadow pretty close to the atmosphere)<br>
Sonic:guys,I found him,and tails.......I think your calculations were alittle off<br>
Tails over intercom:Hold on,oops!!!Sonic,you need to hurry,you only have 8 Minutes<br>
(sonic dives as fast as he can to shadow and grabs him)<br>
Sonic:Luckely hes still in his super form<br>
Sonic:I got him,hes still alive<br>
(sonic starts back to the colony when he sees a beam fly past him,only afew inches away)<br>
Sonic:!!!<br>
Tails over intercom:Sonic!!Watch out,the colonies defense weapons have come back online<br>
Sonic:I thought they were destroyed<br>
Tails over intercom:I don't get it either,you have to be carful and avoid the weapons<br>
Sonic:This is not going to be pleasant<br>
(sonic starts to the colony again and avoids several beams but gets nailed by a turret)<br>
Sonic:ouch!<br>
Tails over intercom:Sonic,the security doors are closing,you need to find another way<br>
(sonic thinks)<br>
Sonic:Chaos Control!<br>
(Inside Space colony ark)<br>
Rouge:Do you think hes going to make it?<br>
Tails:I don't know<br>
(Knuckles sits up)<br>
Knuckles:that energy,he used chaos control<br>
(Sonic and Shadow appear and fall to the floor,still in their super forms)<br>
(Sonic gets up and dusts himself off)<br>
Sonic:hes still not awake<br>
Tails:I wonder how he maneged to stay in his super form for that long<br>
(Sonic changes back,right when he does this Shadow changes back too,though still asleap)<br>
Knuckles:thats it,he maneged to stay alive using the enrgy given off by all 7 emeralds,including the master,but he didn't do it intentionaly,someone wanted to keep him alive<br>
Sonic:hm<br>
Amy:Strange<br>
Sonic:I wonder who<br>
(The colony vibrates)<br>
Knuckles:wait a minute,I recognize that<br>
(Sonic looks out the window)<br>
Sonic:the prototypes still alive!<br>
Amy:That big lizard never gives up,does he<br>
Tails:well,I think that was the source to our escape pod problem<br>
(The colony starts shaking again)<br>
Gerald:All of you ungrateful humans,who took everything away from me,will feel my loss,and despare<br>
Knuckles:here we go again<br>
(out side space colony Ark)<br>
Man:On my command,that prototype will launch to earth,dragging the colony behind<br>
Other person:You allready tried that<br>
Man:Ah,yes,but this time it was unexpected<br>
Other person:are you sure they will not have a victory<br>
Man:oh yes,they will pay with their lives<br>
Other person:what about Shadow?<br>
Man:I will regain control of him,then I will go to countless planets and soler systems,and destroy them all<br>
Other person:I must go now,I have buissness to attend to<br>
