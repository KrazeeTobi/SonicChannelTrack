so nobody has all of the Chao. I remember doing the math and it would take AT LEAST 40 YEARS of gamepaly for all of the Chao.<br>
<br>
You take the types......................75<br>
You take the Chaos Chao..................3<br>
You need the personality...............x10 (estimate)<br>
You need the colors....................100 (estimate)<br>
You need other types of Chao............50 (estimate)<br>
You ALSO need the type of colored Chao.color x75<br>
And more...<br>
<br>
Add 75+3+100=178. Then add the 75x50 which is 3750!<br>
<br>
3750x10= an ASTOUNDING 37,500 (estimated)different types of Chao + many many more.<br>

Well, if you get specific there are over 1,500 Chao, so nobody has all of the Chao. I remember doing the math and it would take AT LEAST 40 YEARS of game play for all of the Chao.<br>
<br>
You take the types.............................75<br>
You take the Chaos Chao.........................3<br>
You need the personality......................x10 (estimate)<br>
You need the colors...........................100 (estimate)<br>
You need other types of Chao...................50 (estimate)<br>
You ALSO need the type of colored Chao color..x75<br>
And more...<br>
<br>
Add 75+3+100=178. Then add the 75x50 which is 3750!<br>
<br>
3750x10= an ASTOUNDING 37,500 (estimated) different types of Chao + many many more.<br>
<br>
But that is with personality so if you make it only physical you have about 3750 TYPES OF CHAO!!!<br>
<br>
It takes at LEAST 2 hours to make a Chao. So do the math. 3750x2 and you have 7,500 rl hours of game play. Which means 312.5 DAYS of game play. Some people maybe play at most an average of 2 hours a day. Meaning for the average game lover it will take 3,750 days to get them all. But remember, only 18 of the 75 types of Chao require 2 hours. The rest require maybe 10. So you would have 3750x7 (averaged) which is 26,250 hours. Times the average a person plays (26,250x2) equals 52500. In days that's 2187.5. In years that's 6 years to get them all.<br>
<br>
GameCube hasn't been out for 6 years. However, maybe someone has done it on DreamCast.<br>
<br>
But 52500 hours is how long a person plays to get only all the types of Chao by physical appearance. Now, all I am going to do is multiply it by 8 because of the personalities and you already have 45 years to get them all.<br>
<br>
But wait! There's more. A GameCube has about a 10 year limited warranty. You'd go through 4 GameCubes, costing you $600. Then maybe your game burns out, so, you have $650 to get them all.<br>
<br>
I guess it's not that much money, but wait 'till you see the electricity bill.

&gt; But that is with personality so if you make it only physical you have about 5625 TYPES OF CHAO!!!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It takes at LEAST 2 hours to make a Chao. So do the math. 5625x2 and you have 11250 rl hours of game play. Which means 468.75 DAYS of game play. Some people maybe play at most an average of 2 hours a day. Meaning for the average game lover it will take 5625 days to get them all. But remember, only 18 of the 75 types of Chao require 2 hours. The rest require maybe 10. So you would have 5625x7 (averaged) which is 39375 hours, times the average a person plays (39375x2) equals 78750! In days that's 3281. In years that's 9 years to get them all.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; GameCube hasn't been out for 9 years. However, maybe someone has done it on DreamCast.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But 3937 hours is how long a person plays to get only all the types of Chao by physical appearance. Now, all I am going to do is multiply it by 8 because of the personalities and you already have 86 years to get them all.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But wait! There's more. A GameCube has about a 10 year limited warranty. You'd go through 8 GameCubes, costing you $800. Then maybe your game burns out, so, you have $850 to get them all.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I guess it's not that much money, but wait 'till you see the electricity bill.<br>

like a month. 'cause you'd have to release a lot of Chao. Plus you have to click &quot;Yes&quot; so many times when you want to release a Chao. That would use up valuable time.

&gt; &gt; Well, if you get specific there are over 1,500 Chao, so nobody has all of the Chao. I remember doing the math and it would take AT LEAST 40 YEARS of game play for all of the Chao.<br>
