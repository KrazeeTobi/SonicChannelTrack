                The Absolute Beginning  <br>
      <br>
      In the Digital World, the most wise of the sovereigns, Azulongmon, began to notice the fact the Digital World seemed to be changing slightly day by day.  He called upon one individual to investigate: Calumon.  Calumon agreed willingly, thinking of whom he might meet along the way.  Before he investigated, he went into the Real World to find his tamer, Ryan, to help.  Ryan accepted.                          <br>
<br>
         Ryan had been experienced in the tamer business.  He was fourteen and was a tamer since ten.  He was lonely but he had Calumon to be company.  He was thrilled to see Calumon at first.  He first found Calumon at his school.  Calumon was playing around on the recess equipment (Ryan was ten at this time).  Ryan cautiously approached, not knowing what it was.  Calumon, acting like he always does, greeted Ryan with a smile and a cheerful attitude.  Ryan was not scared after that and took care of Calumon.  Almost like a baby.  The day after he found Calumon, he woke up with a digivice (D-Power) in his free hand.  He was mesmerized at the apparatus.  He pressed the buttons and saw different screens.  He became confused and ignored it for a while.  After a few years, he discovered the truth about the digivice.  It granted certain powers to a Digimon.  He had a massive collection of cards that he had acquired over the years.  One day, when he was trying to figure out the digivice did, he saw a slot for a thin, flat object.  He tried everything.  When he got to a card out of his collection, the digivice gave off sparks as he “slashed” the card, yet the card remained perfectly ok from the sparks.  He had a certain, determined feeling then.  He, involuntarily, or so it seemed, said the magic words, “Digimodify!”  He didn't know what he did but it affected Calumon in a strange way.  Ryan had never experienced anything so strange.  Over the next two years, he became good at it.<br>
     After the danger of the D-Reaper had been over, thanks to Takato and the others (not including Ryan), everything seemed to go fine.  Calumon and Ryan kept watch in the Digital World for evil making its mark.  They were always happy together and they seemed to have an unbreakable bond.<br>
<br>
                      Destiny's Rebirth     <br>
<br>
      A few months ago, an amazing event happened.  Azulongmon and the others disappeared.  The shrines of the sovereigns had disappeared.  There had been a Digital World reinitialization.  Three Great Angels ruled over the Digital World and protected it against evil.  Ophanimon, Cherubimon, and Seraphimon were the three Great Angels.  A war between human Digimon and beast Digimon soon broke out.  The war was resolved, thanks to the three Great Angels.  After this, Cherubimon began to act strangely and overthrew the other Angels.  Cherubimon became corrupted by his own power.  He ruled over the Digital World.  Ophanimon soon called upon someone that was dependable in the old Digital World:  Ryan and Calumon.<br>
<br>
     Ryan received an email, telling him to come to the Erie Train Station.  He grabbed Calumon, he followed the email's instructions and left home to go to the Train Station.  He was late and so he rode his bike as fast as he could to the Station.  He purchased a ticket and it glimmered, unlike the other tickets.  It said to go down, using the elevator, to the bottom floor.  He got on the elevator, as the ticket instructed.  When the elevator hit the bottom floor, it stopped and opened.  He noticed that there were many trains and the ticket didn't specify which one to leave on.  He closed his eyes and thought.  After a minute of thinking, he opened his eyes and decided to go on the one that was white and had red stripes.  He thought it was a strange looking train, yet he thought it was destiny to go onboard the bizarrely colored train.  No one was on the train.  Only him and Calumon.  The train soon left and they were on their way to &quot;where destiny would lead him&quot; as Ryan stated.  The train stopped three hours later, at another train station.  When Ryan awoke, he had something in his hand.  He was carrying his D-Power but this looked like a fancier D-Power.  It was an upgraded version, capable of new, more powerful things.  He soon left the train, in search of his purpose in the new Digital World.<br>
