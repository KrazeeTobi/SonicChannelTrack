Consider that the first half of this board's history up to now (3 years) brought in over 2200 pages.  The second half has seen just 14, about a 99.4% decrease in activity.  Further consider that a rampaging flood poster under the guise of a &quot;Chao Bandit&quot; gang and attempting to give the impression of multiple individuals, accounts for 1 of those 14 pages, and in any case a lot of what I've seen isn't relevant to the game at all, or belongs somewhere else such as the /chao_en board.<br>
<br>
Of the few users that remain here, how many of them would become disinterested in staying if there weren't any more random derailing or pointless topics?  Would there be enough of a following to get this place back on track?

of sorts. Firstly, ending off topic posts and derailed topics entirely is impossible. Even if it weren't, even SA2B doesn't have infinite replayability. I don't think there are many people interested in time attack. Hell, I'm not interested, except maybe in improving a few specific times. I'd like to shave another five seconds from Final Rush and break the three minute barrier. Also, let's not forget that many of the topics in the &quot;good old days&quot; were still pointless spam. Really, Spam has gone up in relation to total posts made, but down in overall quantity. That being said, I think it might be possible to turn the board back to something slightly more Sonic based, but I believe we'd have to loosen it from SA2B to Sonic in general. At any rate, the board does still serve one purpose. It holds a lot of memories for a lot of people, and has a sort of intrinsic value as a special place for those of us that began friendships that carry on to other sites here.

If there's a limit to replayability, I haven't run into it yet.  Just about a week ago I thought up the idea of trying to complete stages without using the control stick, and so far I've actually managed to get to the lost Chao in Egg Quarters this way.  Even yesterday I found an inconsistency in my assumptions about the count of random piece/key/emerald locations, and after revising the theory I currently have 102 locations found in Death Chamber but only 101 in Wild Canyon and Egg Quarters.  Eventually I'm going to figure out just how this works, and hopefully get the other 6 stages done to a point where I actually know I'm done.<br>
<br>
It doesn't really help that this BBS is low-tech and poorly integrated.  Your idea would be easier to carry out if there was a consolidated &quot;board list&quot; hub like the ones shown in systems like Invision or phpBB, with separate subforums for each game/subject but a navigation system common to all.  As it is, there are some boards on this domain that only have a Japanese version, to include the one on Sonic Heroes; and none of the boards are present for &quot;recent&quot; games.<br>
<br>
Essentially it seems to be the decision of Sonic Team that their tails03 BBS subdomain doesn't generate enough interest to keep maintaining in any form beyond simply having it there.  Whether or not anyone believes in an attempt to contact Sonic Team and get them to either revise this system, or construct a new, more robust system in its place to serve as their official board, is up for discussion, but ultimately they don't have to listen, and assuming a population base of about 20, it's doubtful that they would in any case.<br>
<br>
But that doesn't leave much hope here.
