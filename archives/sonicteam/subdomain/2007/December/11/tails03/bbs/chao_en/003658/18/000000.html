Well, yes I do.<br>
Its Tails.<br>
well, everything started a few days ago when I was sleeping and then something was next to me.<br>
So I open my eyes and I loook at the left of my mattress to see whos there and there it was....TAILS was there sleeping right next to me.... then he woke up and said &quot; hey wat u want, leave alone, dont talk to me because Im extremly pissed off because eggman send me to nowhere (here)&quot; then I interrupt very sad. &quot; hey tails I know how you fell because I know you a lot but please can you stop talking like that because I know you are not like that&quot;.then he replied.&quot; well just turn around and leavve me alone and ple-&quot;.then I interrupt.&quot; Hey, you know what fine take the whole bed if you want, YOU ARE NOT TAILS, TAILS IS NOT LIKE YOU!&quot;.then it was quiet for five minutes and he said &quot;hey, Im sorry....can you come here I dont like to sleep alone, please forgive me. Yes, Im friendly and nice and Im the tails that you know.&quot;<br>
&quot; ok fine.&quot; Then I went back to my matress and sleep with my HERO, Tails.<br>
Then when I was about to sleep he gave me a big hug &quot; I miss everyone, I hope Sonic and the others are ok, but for now Im gonna stay ad live with you is that ok?&quot; Tails said. Then I make a gesture with my head saying YES.<br>
Then we went back to sleep hugging each other. He wrap me with his two tails because my covers were dirty so I have nothing to cover me on nights.<br>
&gt;&gt; Until today I still live with Tails, noone can see him or hear him so when I waant to talk to him I go outside and talk. He know everything about me and now I have a new friend to talk and play. I dont know how this happened but Im really happy!<br>
<br>
I know that someone here is the same situation who has a imaginary friend (not a dream).<br>
Share your experiences here.<br>
Oh, and Tails say HI to everyone!.
