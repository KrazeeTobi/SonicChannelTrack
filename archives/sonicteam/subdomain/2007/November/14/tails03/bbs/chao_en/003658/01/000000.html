Question 2<br>
	Machine guns in World War One were powerful, yet impractical during the beginning of the war. The 1914 machine gun required four to six people to operate. They also could, in theory, fire 400-600 rounds per minute. The problem with these early models is that they overheated very easily. There were two ways of cooling the machine guns: One being large amounts of water; and the cool air in the fall and winter months. The water cooled guns could still easily overheat within two minutes if not cooled immediately, which posed as a problem because of the amount of water needed for this task.  However, even if there was adequate water and air cooling, the machine guns still frequently jammed. Because of these factors, they were normally used on the defensive lines than anything else. <br>
	Tanks were first used in the Battle of Flers. It was also used, with little success, in the battle of the Somme. The idea of tanks came from the farming vehicles that could cross difficult land without effort. The idea was not put into place until June 9th, 1915, by a man named Swinton. He had put specific goals in line that the tank was supposed to be able to accomplish. Compared to other weapons of the time, it was remarkably swift and technologically advanced.<br>
	Poison gas was first used by the French, and not the Germans, as is usually believed. In August of 1914, they fired tear-gas grenades against the Germans. Because of this, the Germans took the knowledge they gained and were the first to use it on a large scale. The first actual poison gas was used in April of 1915, at the start of the Second Battle of Ypres. Within seconds of inhaling the gas the victim’s respiratory organs were destroyed. <br>
	Teddy Roosevelt was the youngest man to become president. He brought new power to the presidency as he led Congress toward strong foreign policy. He believed that the president should take whatever action that was necessary to the society, unless it goes against the constitution or forbidden by law. He had poor health, and they day he married his wife, his mother passed away. He won the Nobel Prize for mediating the Russo-Japanese war. <br>
	The Treaty of Paris was the cause to the ending of the Spanish-American war. Commissioners from the United States and Spain in October of 1898 met in Paris to discuss the treaty. Although the Conference discussed Cuba and debt questions, the major conflict concerned the situation of the Philippines. Admiral Dewey's victory had come as a great surprise and it marked the entrance of the United States into the Pacific. The US paid Spain 20 million dollars for possession of the Philippines. The islands of Puerto Rico and Guam were also taken by America, and Cuba was left to Spain. The Treaty of Paris was signed on December 10th, 1898.<br>
	The blowing up of the battleship USS Maine in Havana harbor on the 15 of February was a critical event on the road to the Spanish-American war. On January 24th, President McKinley sent the USS Maine to Havana in order to investigate the riots and protect the American men there. On the 15th of February a huge explosion from the vessel’s guns caused destruction of the ship. A total of 266 men died on the ship, 260 died shortly after, and 6 died later on from injuries. Allied suspicions decided that it was a hostile action. After investigati <br>
