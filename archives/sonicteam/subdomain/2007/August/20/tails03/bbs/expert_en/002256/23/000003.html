If there's a limit to replayability, I haven't run into it yet.  Just about a week ago I thought up the idea of trying to complete stages without using the control stick, and so far I've actually managed to get to the lost Chao in Egg Quarters this way.  Even yesterday I found an inconsistency in my assumptions about the count of random piece/key/emerald locations, and after revising the theory I currently have 102 locations found in Death Chamber but only 101 in Wild Canyon and Egg Quarters.  Eventually I'm going to figure out just how this works, and hopefully get the other 6 stages done to a point where I actually know I'm done.<br>
<br>
It doesn't really help that this BBS is low-tech and poorly integrated.  Your idea would be easier to carry out if there was a consolidated &quot;board list&quot; hub like the ones shown in systems like Invision or phpBB, with separate subforums for each game/subject but a navigation system common to all.  As it is, there are some boards on this domain that only have a Japanese version, to include the one on Sonic Heroes; and none of the boards are present for &quot;recent&quot; games.<br>
<br>
Essentially it seems to be the decision of Sonic Team that their tails03 BBS subdomain doesn't generate enough interest to keep maintaining in any form beyond simply having it there.  Whether or not anyone believes in an attempt to contact Sonic Team and get them to either revise this system, or construct a new, more robust system in its place to serve as their official board, is up for discussion, but ultimately they don't have to listen, and assuming a population base of about 20, it's doubtful that they would in any case.<br>
<br>
But that doesn't leave much hope here.
