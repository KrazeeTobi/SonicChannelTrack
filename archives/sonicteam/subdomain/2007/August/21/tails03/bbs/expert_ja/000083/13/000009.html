The number of rings that are needed to trigger an A rank, known as the &quot;out-of&quot;, is supposed to be all the rings, but sometimes that total is accurate and sometimes it's not. In Final Chase 1st (and 4th) mission, it's accurate on Dreamcast. With GameCube, the out-of is decreased to 474, but only 472 rings are present, making it impossible (to my knowledge) to receive &quot;PERFECT!&quot; for rings.  The 8 rings that are missing:<br>
(1) with 2:50 remaining on the clock (based on the time I get there in the video), where the formation only has 7 rings instead of 8<br>
(1) with 1:32 remaining, where the chute only has 6 rings instead of 7<br>
(6) with 0:53 remaining, where the chain of rings to light-dash only has 9 instead of 15<br>
<br>
I have a chart at http://soniccenter.org/sm/files/maxrings.txt that summarizes the ring totals.<br>
The 1st column of numbers represents the out-of total for each stage on DC, if you were to get through the level without getting any extra rings from checkpoints, digging up rings, or having rings thrown by enemies (any enemy that throws time-activated bombs, such as &quot;Kiki&quot;, can sometimes throw rings that will add on to both your total and the out-of total).<br>
The 2nd column is the highest number of those rings that I know of anyone obtaining. In levels that have the 2nd number smaller than the 1st, it is believed impossible to get A rank based on rings instead of score.<br>
The 3rd and 4th columns represent the highest numbers (based on the competition charts at http://www.soniccenter.org ) when checkpoint rings are counted. Rings from enemies still do not count, and levels with rings from digging have &quot;N/A&quot; and column 2 remains as the highest total. In some levels, there can be a choice between reaching the out-of total or getting the highest overall ring count. For example, in Green Hill, you can get 286/287 easily by getting +20 rings from the 1st checkpoint. It is also possible to get perfect rings by forgoing +20 rings from that checkpoint and getting an electric shield instead, but this only provides 267/267. In cases where this happens, the results of both options are listed.<br>
<br>
The 5th through 8th columns are for GC, and they serve the same purpose as the 1st through 4th in order.<br>
<br>
I would like to know if you have found improvements to any of the numbers I have listed (columns 2, 3, 6 and 7).
