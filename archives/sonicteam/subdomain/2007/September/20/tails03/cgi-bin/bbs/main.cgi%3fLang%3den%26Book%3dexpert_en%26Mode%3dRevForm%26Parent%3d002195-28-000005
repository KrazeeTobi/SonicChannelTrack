<TEXTAREA NAME="Text" COLS="60" ROWS="6" WRAP="VIRTUAL">&gt; (this chapter's so long that I need to write it in FOUR parts!)
&gt; 
&gt; Mouse Knight: part four
&gt; 
&gt; The Mouseknight gasped and struggled to keep breathing for what seemed like hours as he was washed through tunnels of wet, cold darkness. Occasionally he would plop down into a vast room of water and noise, only to be sucked down another tunnel. Once there was a bit of light and he saw a rat staring at him as he thrashed about, trying to swim to anything that might spare him drowning. The rat was white with a gold color about his head, almost like a light, and looked with compassion on the little mouse being taken by the current out to the great sea. And while the Mouse Knight would rather have stayed to chat, he was swept away again. 
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, waterlogged and miserable, the mouse was spewed out onto a beach, where he clumsily struggled to shore and lay there on his side, gasping for air. Sand coated his fur, and foul sewage he spat from his mouth and coughed from his lungs. He feared becoming sick, and knew he had to find shelter and warmth. 
&gt; 
&gt; Going away from the great, hundred-foot waves speeding up onto the wet sand, he made his way along the beach until he could find a way up the cliffs. And while he was at it, he saw the empty carcass of a small lobster. He sat, tired, and stared at the strange thing for a time. It was hard, and pointy all over. That it had once been alive was not lost on his delicate nose, but now it was just a shell. He couldn't imagine though what had been strong enough to get past that amazing armor. He doubted even a dragon could penetrate that spiked hide. Shrugging, he went onward. Maybe there were worse things than dragons. Soon he found an agreeable spot on the cliff, and went up it like the amazing climbers that all mice are. 
&gt; 
&gt; As the cold night wore on, he grew weaker and weaker - and finally used the last of his strength to crawl pathetically over the edge at the top of the giant cliffs and to a garage where he found a water heater under which he lay for a time, and passed out. 
&gt; 
&gt; When he awoke, he was alone and warm. Cleaning himself off thoroughly, he realized he was also starving and thirsty. Scrounging about, he found some seeds and a bit of water outside the house on the early morning grass. Once he regained his composure, he knew it was a miracle he was still alive. And, in the simple thought of mice, he knew there had to be a reason for this. It had something to do with being a Mouse Knight. Maybe the only Mouse Knight. But beyond that, destiny seemed to escape him. Little did he know that he was on the right track, and like the special little mouse he was, he stayed on that track when his mind decided that fate was too big a word for a little mouse. Turning his mind to other things, he knew he had to find his family and friends. 
&gt; 
&gt; It was at that moment, in that dark garage, that the Mouse Knight knew what he was supposed to do. 
&gt; 
&gt; Mice were treated poorly everywhere. He had never seen any treated well. But somewhere, somehow, it had to happen. And he would make it happen. He would find his fellow escapees - for surely they wouldn't live long without human care. They just weren't wild mice. Thousands of years of domestication had taken its toll. They needed to be cared for, plain and simple. So he would find them - all his family - even back at the pet store! He would set them free - all of them. And then he would find the few - or the one - human who by the law of averages simply had to exist in this world of cruelty to helpless mice. He would find that person - and make them understand that he and his family needed help. 
&gt; 
&gt; And in that solemn moment, he felt more right, and more strong, than ever in his short little life. A soft light of dawn came under the garage door and made his tarnished white coat seem like gold. He knew what he had been born to do. 
&gt; 
&gt; And armed with this, he went right to sleep.
