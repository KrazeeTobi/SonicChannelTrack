&gt; &gt; &gt; to tell you the truth I'm only 13 years old and I really don't care. I just wanted to see the Jeepers Creepers 2 website. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject youir opinion 
&gt; &gt; &gt; dear webmaster 
&gt; &gt; &gt; no one gives a shit about your liberal views.do not use a public site 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to view your opinion. 	
&gt; &gt; &gt; signed 	
&gt; &gt; &gt; a loyal Bush supporter 
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is by far one of the most outrageous and disgusting things I have ever seen. George W. Bush and Tony Blair are great patriots and actually care about their country. The war was started so that Americans and British could live freely without the threat of being attacked by weapons of mass destruction. Sadaam Hussien is a mad man and a cruel tyrant who has murdered many of his own people and Kuwaitis. I have no idea how you can say Tony Blair and George W. Bush have lied because that is a lie. When election day comes around I will vote for George W. Bush because he cared and wanted to do something about Sadaam and the Iraqi regime unlike Bill Clinton and Al Gore. To insult George W. Bush and Tony Blair is and outrage and makes me sick. I want to know if you care about America at all because what you are saying makes me sick, because of that so called &quot;pointless&quot; war Americans, British and many other people don't have to worry about the Iraqi regime dropping weapons of mass destruction or chemicals weapons on them and killing them. I feel that the war was not pointless but something that needed to be done. We took a stand and if you believe that President Bush and Prime Minister Blair lied to us then you must not remember September 11, 2001. Thousands of American lives were took when terrorists hijacked American planes and flew them into the World Trade Centers and Pentagon. Terrorism is a huge threat and many innocent lives have been taken. Sadaam Hussien and the Iraqi Regime are a huge terrorist group and they were a threat to Americans, British, and many other innocent lives. That threat is being neutralized so the world will be a safer place.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And on the topic of the French-The French owe America and Great Britain there lives. I am not saying that is the way the entire country of France has the same beliefs as Chirac and the other French leader but I think that France made a horrible move when they did not take any action. I believe that if France had come under attack by terrorists or by another country they would turn to the United States of America and Great Britain for help-just like they did in World War II. Great American and British soldiers lost their lives fighting for France. If you don't believe me look at Normandy-one of the many battlefields where brave American and British soldiers lost their lives.
