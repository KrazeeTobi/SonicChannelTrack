&gt; Questions are marked with a Q,<br>
&gt; If it's True,it's marked with a T,<br>
&gt; If it's False,it's marked with an F.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Q  Is it true that E-102  ( the robotic Robotnik )  is in the game?<br>
&gt; T!  Everybody says he's not in it,but if you beat all of Rouge's missions,<br>
&gt; you can be E-102 in the Kart Races.  ( Rouge's alternate &quot;kart&quot; )<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Q  Is it true that you can see &quot;a little more&quot; of Rouge in this game?<br>
&gt; AMAZINGLY T!!<br>
&gt; Actually,you can see about 70% of her body!<br>
&gt; This is another one that everyone denies because the game is<br>
&gt; &quot;E&quot; rated.  ( for everyone )  I don't think ESRB is gonna unlock<br>
&gt; everything in the game to find out,and even if I'm wrong...<br>
&gt; These days...Nobody really cares!  It would be strange if she was<br>
&gt; &quot;Anatomically Incorrect&quot;!  So shut up and...<br>
&gt; Get all &quot;A&quot; ranks with Rouge. <br>
&gt; She'll have an alternate costume in multiplayer!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Q  Is it true that there's a &quot;LAST&quot; story in the game?<br>
&gt; ?  Why don't you BEAT the Hero and Dark stories,<br>
&gt; and FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!!<br>
&gt; I don't care how much you insist there's a Game Over screen!<br>
&gt; If you haven't found it after the amount of times you've died,<br>
&gt; it OBVIOUSLY isn't there!!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Q  Is it true that Mario makes an appearance in SA2B to<br>
&gt; show that Sega and Sonic Team are no longer enemies of Nintendo?<br>
&gt; F  Uhh...no.  Mario isn't in this.<br>
&gt; I think it's a rule that Company mascots DON'T<br>
&gt; appear on other companies' games or something.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Q  I found a bunch of sites that tell me where to see BIG the cat...<br>
&gt; But I can't find him!  I even triple checked the locations!<br>
&gt; Is he really in the game?<br>
&gt; ?  Umm...<br>
&gt; Some people say he was taken out of SA2 when the B was added.<br>
&gt; Other people say that there are 2 versions of SA2B...I donno.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Q  Is Tails a guy or a girl?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I honestly don't know.<br>
&gt; I'll post pics of tails on the site I'm gonna make.<br>
&gt; Pics that have a girly looking Tails,and pics with Normal Tails.<br>
&gt; I can't just go by the old show,either!<br>
&gt; Some things just change on TV...<br>
&gt; Sometimes even just different series will have a different few people<br>
&gt; and stuff like that!  An example is...<br>
&gt; In the game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;,the character &quot;Roy&quot;<br>
&gt; has RED HAIR...But in the anime called &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;,<br>
&gt; ( which is where Roy and Marth came from )<br>
&gt; Roy has GREEN HAIR!!  So even though Tails is a guy in the show...<br>
&gt; I think...I can't just say he's a guy in the game,too...<br>
&gt; I think he's a guy,though...He doesn't act like a girl,and if he was...<br>
&gt; Amy Rose wouldn't stand a chance!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Well,that's all for now...<br>
&gt; Oh...yah...EGGMAN and ROBOTNIK are NOT the same person!<br>
&gt; ( also,I think that's spelled with a C before the K...maybe...)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; DO NOT give me negative answers on this stuff<br>
&gt; unless you KNOW that something I said is wrong.<br>
&gt; Any other negative responses will be ignored!<br>
