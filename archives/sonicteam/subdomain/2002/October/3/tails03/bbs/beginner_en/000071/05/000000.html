Chao are cute little things that are cute. they hatch from eggs as big as they are. somehow, the chao-s lay this whopping egg easily after mating. chao-s mate by dancing. you'll know when a chao wants to mate by the ring of flowers it's sitting in. They like normal nuts, but each chao has their own favorite food. By the way, normal nuts come from trees. if you give a chao a fruit it does not like, it will make a disgruntled noise and toss it over its shoulder. Each chao has its own personallity, characteristics, and favorite food. sometimes it is born without one of these things. the way you hatch an egg affects its personality. you can smash it against rocks, let it hatch in the water, gently rock it, let it hatch on its own, or shove a unicorn in its face as its coming out of its shell. After taking care of it for aproximatly one hour, it will evolve into a mature chao. chao-s can be different types, depending on their stats at this time. the stat must be level ten or higher for the chao to turn into this type. Chao-s live for about eight hours, then they die. if you treated them good, they will remember you and reincarnate. if you didn't they just die forever. Chao will learn an ability related to their stats. if a stat number is 100, they will be granted the ability.( walking , swimming, flying...) if that stat reaches 700, they will do that ability a little differently. Chaos chao-s are immortal chaos. to make one, let it die and reincarnate twice. before it matures again, give it all 21 animals(one of each to be safe) There! a partial chaography, not exactly the best, but at least I tried.
