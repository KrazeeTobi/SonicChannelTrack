Why<br>
Why, how, what. These words lurk in the mind, silently driving us insane. The human may not be aware of it, but it is there. A need, an obsession. To find the anser, the meaning of reality. This is what makes us strive to improve, to advance, not just survive. This need is what makes a human difernt form the rest of living things, humanity wants to excel and thrive, while the animal merely wants to survive.It is there will that drives them, there will that forces them to seek knowledge so hungrily. It is like a hole. A hole deepens the more that is put in it. And as humanity hopelessly shovels all they can into it, the greater the desire to fill the hole becomes, Until everything that was unknown becomes known, But the will is still thear. Still driven them to find out more. This shatters the mind of humanity. Having infinite knowledge destroys them. The hole becomes so massive it devours the mind, and humanity is completely destroyed. Shattered, their will broken, They no longer wish to survive and disappear. All there effort in vain... Until another humanity rises doomed to the same fate...<br>
