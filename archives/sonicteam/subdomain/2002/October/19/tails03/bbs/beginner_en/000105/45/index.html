KNUCKLES' THEME unknown from m.e.<br>
---------------                  <br>
<br>
OK! (SCRATCH)<br>
<br>
Something's callin' me, I don't know what,<br>
Something's talkin' but I don't know who.<br>
Something's callin' me more and more,<br>
No-one stops Knuckles' feet!<br>
Something's callin' me, I don't know what,<br>
Something's talkin' but I don't know who.<br>
Something's callin' me more and more,<br>
No-one stops Knuckles' feet!<br>
<br>
K.N.U.C.K.L.E.S.,<br>
Was born for a lifetime on Angel Island yeah,<br>
His duty's to protect Master Emerald diamond,<br>
Hold the climate, he's searching for shining.<br>
But every time he look for the sun can't find it,<br>
Is this the way, the path I chose?<br>
Then why am I living with my heart so cold?<br>
All that I see is a storm of stones?<br>
<br>
(in this part, 1 is at the same time as 2.)<br>
<br>
1 - I like to dig holes in search of gold,<br>
    Large pots of treasure make me feel much better.<br>
2 - Born on an island in the heaven.<br>
<br>
1 - If I find Eggman, Rouge, whoever,<br>
    Clench my fists tight, become more ready!<br>
2 - The blood on my ancestors flows inside me.<br>
<br>
1 - I don't wanna hurta, my passion observed,<br>
    I been lonely all my life, doesn't matter.<br>
2 - My duty is to save the flower.<br>
<br>
1 - Here for the mission, whoever want it bring it,<br>
    Cold and stubborn but I still gon' live it.<br>
2 - From evil deterioration, yeah!<br>
<br>
Do anything to get pieces of the Emerald,<br>
Climb the mountain, through the valley around the hill,<br>
Wild and hungry, ain't a damn thing funny,<br>
My philosophy's, my knuckles and feet!<br>
<br>
Streaking lights, loud sounds, and instinct,<br>
Are the elements that keep me going.<br>
I am fighting my own mission,<br>
Nothing's gonna, stand in my way, noooo!<br>
<br>
Something's callin' me, I don't know what,<br>
Something's talkin' but I don't know who.<br>
Something's callin' me more and more,<br>
No-one stops Knuckles' feet!<br>
<br>
(INSTRUMENTAL)<br>
<br>
Won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil,<br>
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others.<br>
I get this power to wipe out the havoc and anarchy,<br>
This is my planet, gonna fight for my destiny.<br>
<br>
Something's callin' me, I don't know what,<br>
Something's talkin' but I don't know who.<br>
Something's callin' me more and more,<br>

<br>
(INSTRUMENTAL)<br>
<br>
I have no such things as weak spots,<br>
Don't approve of him but gotta trust him.<br>
This alliance has a purpose,<br>
This partnership is, only temporary, oh!<br>
<br>
HEY!<br>
<br>
Won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil,<br>
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others.<br>
We will be waiting when serenity is restored,<br>
This is my planet, I shall not surreeeeeeeender!<br>
<br>
I was born like this, to fear no-one,<br>
I'm straight thugged out, only live to my ones,<br>
Diamonds and gems, we 'ka battle to the end,<br>
You best ta be aware of the knuckles that I send.<br>
Once they penetrate, they put you to your death,<br>
They hard as iron, and my feet is like fire,<br>
You never see me run and I won't surrender,<br>
I just fly away like it's no other contender, uh!<br>
<br>
Won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil,<br>
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others.<br>
I get this power to wipe out the havoc and anarchy,<br>
This is my planet, gonna fight, aaaah!<br>
