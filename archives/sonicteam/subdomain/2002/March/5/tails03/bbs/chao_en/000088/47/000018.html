OK here is all the info on the will-be Ultimate Chaoform codenamed SHADOWX:<br>
<br>

<br>
Type: 1st evolution Swimming, 2nd evolution WILL BE running.<br>
<br>
Home: 1st Life: Born in Normal Garden, raised in Dark Garden after evolution into a normal dark chao.<br>
<br>
      2nd Life: Born and raised in Dark Garden.<br>
<br>
Personality: Angry eyes, happy face.  Enjoys swimming and listening to the radio ^_^ Comes when I whistle as Eggman.  Enjoys playing, petting, and snacks.<br>
<br>
Favors: Eggman, Creepy Fruit.<br>
<br>
Toys: Shovel, Watering Can<br>
<br>
Techniques: Singing, belly slides, backstroke, more I don't know yet.<br>
<br>
Raised by: Eggman<br>
<br>
Friends: Ryokie, the imported black chao from SA1.<br>
         Ryokie's son, a special black chao like the black one from SA1 (the dna stays in the chao so Ryokie had a permenant black chao).<br>
         A Dark skunk-like normal dark Chao.<br>
         LilRobo, my friend's Chao, a running and then swimming chao, newly evolved already as the running, also raised by eggamn, only by him actually!  Just a little with Shadow.  This chao is saved in my garden so he can help too!!!<br>
<br>
Animal Features:  All otter and penguin things, will be all rabbits soon.<br>
<br>
Stat overveiw: Lots of Stamina and Intelligence.  Great swimmer and will be a great runner soon.<br>
<br>
Current Stats (subject to change):<br>
<br>
Swim: 114<br>
Fly: 015<br>
Run: 028<br>
Power: 015<br>
Luck: 100<br>
Intelligence: 15<br>
Stamina: 51<br>
<br>
I know the stas aren't much but give it some time it was just reborn!!!  They will go up quicker also because it was reborn.<br>
<br>
Headball color: Light Bluish Green.  Spikey, not flamed.<br>
<br>
History: This was my first chao on SA2, it was born in the normal garden with the dearly departed OR SHOULD I SAY ERASED DAMMIT (sorry, emotional momment there heheh...) Shachao.  It is pure and was born on SA2.  Never touched an editor.  Had a good but rough childhood, I hit it twice because I was still getting used to raising chao in SA2.  After it evolved and opened the Dark Garden, I put it there and left it for a while to try and fail at raising hero chao.  They all died, so I tried Dark.  I went to the Dark Garden and raised ShadowX with much love with all the Dark people, but mostly with Robotnik (it likes Shadow and Rouge too).  It later became the Champion of the Begginer Races, and that badge was trasfored over when it was reborn.  I was my first Chao to be reborn instead of dieing!!!  It always came when I whistled.  Right now I am working on raising its stats (it just evolved).  They go up a lot faster because it was reborn.<br>
<br>
Other Notes:  It looks like my sneakers!!!  Was bio-engineered to be special with Chaos Drive Genetic Combinations (CDGC).  IT STILL HAS GOOD HEART EVEN THOUGH IT IS DARK AND BIO-CREATED!!!  It was still born from an egg.  I created this process myself.  It will do all it can to help.<br>
<br>
It still looks like Shadow even though it isn't 1st evolution running.  It has two or three upward spikes that are light blue.  Looks more like Shadow then running chaos!!!<br>
<br>
Quote:  &quot;I am Shadow's dark power in a waterproof package!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dark but not evil.  It can lead Underwater attacks and soon it will also be able to handle land (when I get its running stats up.<br>
<br>
If you have any more questions post them in the new thread or this one!!!  Thanks!  I will give you updates on its stats.  All chao under &quot;Friends&quot; can fight too.  I hope you enjoy my growing army of good Darkness!!!<br>
