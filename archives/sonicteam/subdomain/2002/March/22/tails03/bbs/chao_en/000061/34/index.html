Hello.<br>
<br>
My screen name is Ultroid Blue. And, well<br>
I have a confession to make. It isn't<br>
pretty, so all you out there in bbs-land<br>
who can't stomach this sort of thing<br>
should use your back button now...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok. Here goes.<br>
<br>
Today I intentionally and willingfully<br>
beat a chao, injuring it severely. I<br>
continued to attack the defenseless<br>
chao as it screamed and ran from me,<br>
and ended my assault by placing it into<br>
a vmu and deleteing it forever.<br>
<br>
Gruesome as it is, even more sickening<br>
is what provoked such a grizzly fate.<br>
It all began in the normal garden. I was<br>
tending to my various chao, petting,<br>
hugging, feeding, and most importantly<br>
raising their stats with chaos drives.<br>
<br>
Everything was going as usual except<br>
for this one chao who kept following me.<br>
I would pet it and think nothing more.<br>
But it's affection towards me drove it<br>
to continually shadow my every movement<br>
in hopes of another snuggle. It seemed<br>
so, so...dirty.<br>
<br>
I let it tag along for what seemed to be<br>
hours. I had duties to complete. But this<br>
chao's demanding nature was treading on<br>
my very thin patience. It kept grinning<br>
this uncomfortable grin in my direction.<br>
I was very uneasy at this point. I had<br>
downloaded that particular chao, and<br>
its' motives were not yet clear to me.<br>
<br>
Then, in an instant, A-life in the garden<br>
changed for the worse.<br>
<br>
I had just harvested a new fruit from<br>
a tree planted earlier, and was about to<br>
feed it to one of my best chao, when<br>
in runs my stalker who assumes the<br>
fruit was for it. The chao snatches the<br>
fruit out from under my nose and sits<br>
down with a smile for it's last meal.<br>
<br>
In a frantic act, I grab the fruit from<br>
the chao. But it grabs it right back<br>
and continues it's feeding. Desperate<br>
to save the fruit, I...<br>
<br>
...I...hit, the chao. I must have hit it<br>
too hard because it went flying into the<br>
pond. I dropped the fruit and went to<br>
aid my struggling friend. But as I<br>
grabbed for it, the chao bucked and<br>
twisted from my grasp.<br>
I was shocked. My once biggest fan<br>
had turned my enemy in one angry swipe.<br>
It scoweled at me and I could tell it was<br>
holding back tears. I tried to cuddle it<br>
and say I was sorry...but...it, it wouldn't<br>
listen.,,IT WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!<br>
<br>
I then noticed something else: in my<br>
initial attempt to secure my fruit,<br>
I had wounded not only the new chao<br>
but also the chao I spent hours<br>
raising from an egg myself; the chao<br>
whom the fruit had been intended for in<br>
the first place.<br>
<br>
Enraged, I flung it with all my might<br>
into the marble stone wall of the<br>
garden. It landed in a heap. What<br>
started as a sniffle led to a full<br>
blown wail as my chao victim burst<br>
into tears. It kept crying and WOULDN'T<br>
SHUT UP! I hit it some more. I kicked it,<br>
stomped it, and rebounded it off of<br>
walls a few times untill it stopped its'<br>
crying. It looked right at me. Right into<br>
my soul. It then turned about face and<br>
ran full tilt away from me, screaming<br>
all the way.<br>
<br>
I chased it down and realized there was<br>
no turning back now. This was going to<br>
be the ultimate punishment. I held the<br>
dying chao fast against me. Despite it's<br>
struggles, I managed to hurl it into the<br>
transporter. I uploaded it into the vmu<br>
and in one instant, I pushed the memory<br>
manager's button and erased the chao<br>
from existance. The other chao saw the<br>
whole incident go down, and I couldn't<br>
have any witnesses to pin me to the<br>
scene of the murder. T-they...met with<br>
a similar fate.<br>
<br>
And that dear friends is my story. I have<br>
come to terms with my actions and am<br>
continuing on with my life. If you have<br>
a similar tale, then by all means share<br>
it with the group. Let us learn and grow<br>
from each others' mistakes. Although...<br>
sometimes, I feel that, that those chao<br>
aren't gone forever and may be<br>
born again.<br>
<br>
I can still hear...the screams...<br>
<br>

Really dramatic dude.<br>
<br>
I've beaten on my chao before, but I'd never save it or anything. I dont like to hit my chao, but the damn glitches in the game and the horrible controls are the problem! Next time you have a problem like that put the freak into the water! So he cant follow you no more, or jump up really high onto the stone ledges and that way it cant see you so it wont follow you.<br>
<br>
I love my chao... maybe a little too much. *tear*<br>

LOL you are one funny guy, Ultroid Blue! I had a similar incident over something more trivial.<br>
<br>
A chao of mine continually slept.<br>
All day.<br>
All night.<br>
I couldnt feed it, i couldnt give it animals or Chaos Drives, and so it was just using space up on my Chao File. And so, donning EggMan's Red and black suit, along with that ridiculous moustache, I entered the Chao Garden, and picked it up. It wasnt suspecting a thing, and was more than pleased to see Dr. Robotnik, as it was a Dark Chao raised by him.<br>
I took the Chao to the unnocupied-at the time- Dark Garden, and placed him on the floor, giving him one last chance to get off his fat lazy be-hind and do something.<br>
But no.<br>
He lies down and starts snoring.<br>
In a complete and total infuriated moment, i ran at the Chao and kicked it in the nose. He went flying in to the blood-red water, and swam back to the edge. Then, to my mixed amusement and anger, he returned to his slumber. Looking around to see we were alone, I snuck up on him, and slapped him round the head. Then, before he even hit the floor, I was on him again. I booted him so hard they heard the dull thump on Mars, and the Chao was sent careening in to a tombstone. I thought &quot;thats enough, he wont sleep any more.&quot; And i went to leave. As i reached the doorway, I heard a famillear noise.<br>
Snoring.<br>
So I proceeded to knock 7 shades out of the little fegger, put him on my oldest and most broken VMU and smashed his face in with a hammer.<br>
<br>
I dont regret my actions, laziness among Chao should NOT be totlerated.

Yes, That's it friend. Letting go of our<br>

&gt; had turned my enemy in one angry swipe.<br>
&gt; It scoweled at me and I could tell it was<br>
&gt; holding back tears. I tried to cuddle it<br>
&gt; and say I was sorry...but...it, it wouldn't<br>
&gt; listen.,,IT WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I then noticed something else: in my<br>
&gt; initial attempt to secure my fruit,<br>
&gt; I had wounded not only the new chao<br>
&gt; but also the chao I spent hours<br>
&gt; raising from an egg myself; the chao<br>
&gt; whom the fruit had been intended for in<br>
&gt; the first place.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Enraged, I flung it with all my might<br>
&gt; into the marble stone wall of the<br>
&gt; garden. It landed in a heap. What<br>
&gt; started as a sniffle led to a full<br>
&gt; blown wail as my chao victim burst<br>
&gt; into tears. It kept crying and WOULDN'T<br>
&gt; SHUT UP! I hit it some more. I kicked it,<br>
&gt; stomped it, and rebounded it off of<br>
&gt; walls a few times untill it stopped its'<br>
&gt; crying. It looked right at me. Right into<br>
&gt; my soul. It then turned about face and<br>
&gt; ran full tilt away from me, screaming<br>
&gt; all the way.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I chased it down and realized there was<br>
&gt; no turning back now. This was going to<br>
&gt; be the ultimate punishment. I held the<br>
&gt; dying chao fast against me. Despite it's<br>
&gt; struggles, I managed to hurl it into the<br>
&gt; transporter. I uploaded it into the vmu<br>
&gt; and in one instant, I pushed the memory<br>
&gt; manager's button and erased the chao<br>
&gt; from existance. The other chao saw the<br>
&gt; whole incident go down, and I couldn't<br>
&gt; have any witnesses to pin me to the<br>
&gt; scene of the murder. T-they...met with<br>
&gt; a similar fate.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And that dear friends is my story. I have<br>
&gt; come to terms with my actions and am<br>
&gt; continuing on with my life. If you have<br>
&gt; a similar tale, then by all means share<br>
&gt; it with the group. Let us learn and grow<br>
&gt; from each others' mistakes. Although...<br>
&gt; sometimes, I feel that, that those chao<br>
&gt; aren't gone forever and may be<br>
&gt; born again.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I can still hear...the screams...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
