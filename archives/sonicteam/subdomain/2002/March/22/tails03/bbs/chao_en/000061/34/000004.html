&gt; Hello.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My screen name is Ultroid Blue. And, well<br>
&gt; I have a confession to make. It isn't<br>
&gt; pretty, so all you out there in bbs-land<br>
&gt; who can't stomach this sort of thing<br>
&gt; should use your back button now...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Ok. Here goes.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Today I intentionally and willingfully<br>
&gt; beat a chao, injuring it severely. I<br>
&gt; continued to attack the defenseless<br>
&gt; chao as it screamed and ran from me,<br>
&gt; and ended my assault by placing it into<br>
&gt; a vmu and deleteing it forever.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Gruesome as it is, even more sickening<br>
&gt; is what provoked such a grizzly fate.<br>
&gt; It all began in the normal garden. I was<br>
&gt; tending to my various chao, petting,<br>
&gt; hugging, feeding, and most importantly<br>
&gt; raising their stats with chaos drives.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Everything was going as usual except<br>
&gt; for this one chao who kept following me.<br>
&gt; I would pet it and think nothing more.<br>
&gt; But it's affection towards me drove it<br>
&gt; to continually shadow my every movement<br>
&gt; in hopes of another snuggle. It seemed<br>
&gt; so, so...dirty.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I let it tag along for what seemed to be<br>
&gt; hours. I had duties to complete. But this<br>
&gt; chao's demanding nature was treading on<br>
&gt; my very thin patience. It kept grinning<br>
&gt; this uncomfortable grin in my direction.<br>
&gt; I was very uneasy at this point. I had<br>
&gt; downloaded that particular chao, and<br>
&gt; its' motives were not yet clear to me.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Then, in an instant, A-life in the garden<br>
&gt; changed for the worse.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I had just harvested a new fruit from<br>
&gt; a tree planted earlier, and was about to<br>
&gt; feed it to one of my best chao, when<br>
&gt; in runs my stalker who assumes the<br>
&gt; fruit was for it. The chao snatches the<br>
&gt; fruit out from under my nose and sits<br>
&gt; down with a smile for it's last meal.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In a frantic act, I grab the fruit from<br>
&gt; the chao. But it grabs it right back<br>
&gt; and continues it's feeding. Desperate<br>
&gt; to save the fruit, I...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; ...I...hit, the chao. I must have hit it<br>
&gt; too hard because it went flying into the<br>
&gt; pond. I dropped the fruit and went to<br>
&gt; aid my struggling friend. But as I<br>
&gt; grabbed for it, the chao bucked and<br>
&gt; twisted from my grasp.<br>
&gt; I was shocked. My once biggest fan<br>
&gt; had turned my enemy in one angry swipe.<br>
&gt; It scoweled at me and I could tell it was<br>
&gt; holding back tears. I tried to cuddle it<br>
&gt; and say I was sorry...but...it, it wouldn't<br>
&gt; listen.,,IT WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I then noticed something else: in my<br>
&gt; initial attempt to secure my fruit,<br>
&gt; I had wounded not only the new chao<br>
&gt; but also the chao I spent hours<br>
&gt; raising from an egg myself; the chao<br>
&gt; whom the fruit had been intended for in<br>
&gt; the first place.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Enraged, I flung it with all my might<br>
&gt; into the marble stone wall of the<br>
&gt; garden. It landed in a heap. What<br>
&gt; started as a sniffle led to a full<br>
&gt; blown wail as my chao victim burst<br>
&gt; into tears. It kept crying and WOULDN'T<br>
&gt; SHUT UP! I hit it some more. I kicked it,<br>
&gt; stomped it, and rebounded it off of<br>
&gt; walls a few times untill it stopped its'<br>
&gt; crying. It looked right at me. Right into<br>
&gt; my soul. It then turned about face and<br>
&gt; ran full tilt away from me, screaming<br>
&gt; all the way.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I chased it down and realized there was<br>
&gt; no turning back now. This was going to<br>
&gt; be the ultimate punishment. I held the<br>
&gt; dying chao fast against me. Despite it's<br>
&gt; struggles, I managed to hurl it into the<br>
&gt; transporter. I uploaded it into the vmu<br>
&gt; and in one instant, I pushed the memory<br>
&gt; manager's button and erased the chao<br>
&gt; from existance. The other chao saw the<br>
&gt; whole incident go down, and I couldn't<br>
&gt; have any witnesses to pin me to the<br>
&gt; scene of the murder. T-they...met with<br>
&gt; a similar fate.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And that dear friends is my story. I have<br>
&gt; come to terms with my actions and am<br>
&gt; continuing on with my life. If you have<br>
&gt; a similar tale, then by all means share<br>
&gt; it with the group. Let us learn and grow<br>
&gt; from each others' mistakes. Although...<br>
&gt; sometimes, I feel that, that those chao<br>
&gt; aren't gone forever and may be<br>
&gt; born again.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I can still hear...the screams...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;                              -Ultroid Blue<br>
<br>
I SWEAR YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK ON ABUSING CHAO!!
