Hello.<br>
<br>
My screen name is Ultroid Blue. And, well<br>
I have a confession to make. It isn't<br>
pretty, so all you out there in bbs-land<br>
who can't stomach this sort of thing<br>
should use your back button now...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok. Here goes.<br>
<br>
Today I intentionally and willingfully<br>
beat a chao, injuring it severely. I<br>
continued to attack the defenseless<br>
chao as it screamed and ran from me,<br>
and ended my assault by placing it into<br>
a vmu and deleteing it forever.<br>
<br>
Gruesome as it is, even more sickening<br>
is what provoked such a grizzly fate.<br>
It all began in the normal garden. I was<br>
tending to my various chao, petting,<br>
hugging, feeding, and most importantly<br>
raising their stats with chaos drives.<br>
<br>
Everything was going as usual except<br>
for this one chao who kept following me.<br>
I would pet it and think nothing more.<br>
But it's affection towards me drove it<br>
to continually shadow my every movement<br>
in hopes of another snuggle. It seemed<br>
so, so...dirty.<br>
<br>
I let it tag along for what seemed to be<br>
hours. I had duties to complete. But this<br>
chao's demanding nature was treading on<br>
my very thin patience. It kept grinning<br>
this uncomfortable grin in my direction.<br>
I was very uneasy at this point. I had<br>
downloaded that particular chao, and<br>
its' motives were not yet clear to me.<br>
<br>
Then, in an instant, A-life in the garden<br>
changed for the worse.<br>
<br>
I had just harvested a new fruit from<br>
a tree planted earlier, and was about to<br>
feed it to one of my best chao, when<br>
in runs my stalker who assumes the<br>
fruit was for it. The chao snatches the<br>
fruit out from under my nose and sits<br>
down with a smile for it's last meal.<br>
<br>
In a frantic act, I grab the fruit from<br>
the chao. But it grabs it right back<br>
and continues it's feeding. Desperate<br>
to save the fruit, I...<br>
<br>
...I...hit, the chao. I must have hit it<br>
too hard because it went flying into the<br>
pond. I dropped the fruit and went to<br>
aid my struggling friend. But as I<br>
grabbed for it, the chao bucked and<br>
twisted from my grasp.<br>
I was shocked. My once biggest fan<br>
had turned my enemy in one angry swipe.<br>
It scoweled at me and I could tell it was<br>
holding back tears. I tried to cuddle it<br>
and say I was sorry...but...it, it wouldn't<br>
listen.,,IT WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME!<br>
<br>
I then noticed something else: in my<br>
initial attempt to secure my fruit,<br>
I had wounded not only the new chao<br>
but also the chao I spent hours<br>
raising from an egg myself; the chao<br>
whom the fruit had been intended for in<br>
the first place.<br>
<br>
Enraged, I flung it with all my might<br>
into the marble stone wall of the<br>
garden. It landed in a heap. What<br>
started as a sniffle led to a full<br>
blown wail as my chao victim burst<br>
into tears. It kept crying and WOULDN'T<br>
SHUT UP! I hit it some more. I kicked it,<br>
stomped it, and rebounded it off of<br>
walls a few times untill it stopped its'<br>
crying. It looked right at me. Right into<br>
my soul. It then turned about face and<br>
ran full tilt away from me, screaming<br>
all the way.<br>
<br>
I chased it down and realized there was<br>
no turning back now. This was going to<br>
be the ultimate punishment. I held the<br>
dying chao fast against me. Despite it's<br>
struggles, I managed to hurl it into the<br>
transporter. I uploaded it into the vmu<br>
and in one instant, I pushed the memory<br>
manager's button and erased the chao<br>
from existance. The other chao saw the<br>
whole incident go down, and I couldn't<br>
have any witnesses to pin me to the<br>
scene of the murder. T-they...met with<br>
a similar fate.<br>
<br>
And that dear friends is my story. I have<br>
come to terms with my actions and am<br>
continuing on with my life. If you have<br>
a similar tale, then by all means share<br>
it with the group. Let us learn and grow<br>
from each others' mistakes. Although...<br>
sometimes, I feel that, that those chao<br>
aren't gone forever and may be<br>
born again.<br>
<br>
I can still hear...the screams...<br>
<br>
