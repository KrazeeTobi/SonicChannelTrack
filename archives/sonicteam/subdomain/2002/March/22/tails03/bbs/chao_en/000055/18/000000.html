OH GOOD LORD THIS IS GIVING ME A HUGE HEADACHE AND I NEED HELP FROM ANY DC USER I CAN FIND!! <br>
<br>
OK OK, I will explain the problem and you might (or might not) have more experience with this than me, since I rarely use the DC to go online. But please help! This all has to do with one simple (or so I thought) concept... e-mailing and downloading VMU save files. I will tell you everything I have done and I am damn sure I did everything right! It makes no sense!!! OK so here goes.<br>
<br>
And just so you know I use Seganet for my DC. So there isnt any ISP problems on that end.<br>
<br>
First of all I wanted to copy my Chao Adventure 2 file, so this is what I have done. First I go online with my Dreamcast (with sonic 2 disk) and load the attachment to the e-mail, and e-mail myself to my yahoo.com account, so I could RE-EMAIL the attachment back to my DC account and download it at any time. OK so I go to download the attachment (once again using the Sonic 2 disk) and all I get is text... Grrrr fine. So I use my NEW 2.6 browser (dreamcall and all) and still I get text. FINE! So then I tried to go to yahoo.com with my DC and download it there, NO WORK! FINE! So then I use my seganet account to e-mail that same account! E-mailing my DC using my DC! So I thought that this was FULL-PROOF! I go on the 2.6 browser and and e-mail myself (to seganet) the chao adventure 2 file, and I check my e-mail right away and its there! And when I click on it, the &quot;attachment button&quot; is at the bottem of the e-mail! I was sooooooo happy......... but then I downloaded it and I went to my chao garden... AND THE FILE STILL DIDNT WORK! I WENT TO MY SYSTEM MEMORY MANAGER AND IT SHOWS A &quot;RED X&quot; OVER THE FILE ICON! THIS IS DRIVING ME NUTS! Is it only this file the reason why it wont work? Maybe its only Chao Adventure 2, but I'm really frustrated and I want to know what are the exact requirements for me to RECIEVE a USEABLE VMU file! Are only certain files able to be downloaded?!<br>
<br>
What do I have to do to make sure that when I go to download it that it will work! If I sent you the file would it work? Since I used SegaNet to send to SegaNet on the newest browser I can't understand whats going on! Which browser for a fact do you know allows me to send/download VMU files?<br>
<br>
Well thats all, thanks if you reply, and go to hell if you dont reply! :P!!!<br>
