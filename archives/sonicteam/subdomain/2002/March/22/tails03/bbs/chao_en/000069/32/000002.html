&gt; In Kart Racing, you should also race in different(other) vehicles, like a hovercraft, airplane(like the tornado 2). All these i deas came from Diddy Kong Racing also for 64. Also race by a skate board and a snowboard, Cars on the road too. Loops, using light speed dash sometimes(in air sometimes). Also kart racing battle mode like both MARIO KART 64 and DIDY KONG RACING 64. Battle in different vehicles in big arenas. The players either choose to Battle each other or Accomplish the mission first. When i It doesn't end when 1 person completes the mission first, it ends when everyone completes there mission(last person can forfeit). Drive as every chacter(Sonic, Amy, Shadow, Big The Cat, Tails, Eegman(Robotnik), Rouge, Knuckles and of course E 102 and E 103(more Characters than any other game). Driving style: MARIO KART 64, Other vehicles like DIDDY KONG RACING(including skate board and snowboard(maybe you can include also a bike or something(just a suggestion, can't inagine those people on bikes, might look rediculus)). The courses take place all over the world(cave, streets, space, temples, ice places, dark places, hero places(look at chao racing for example on hero and dark courses), mountains, grass areas(grassy areas)etc. and every where else) Still put ramp and boosts. cpu opponent dive staight not all over the road, include weapons(homing missiles or something, weapons that have something to do with the game(make alot of weapons or a whole lot of weapons for more enjoyment, you get weapons by hitting boxes(like the mario kart game) and when you hit a box. it starts going through weapons(like roulette), press a button to make it stop moving and that's your weapon. look at mario and diddy for the best weapons to make, and what ever power ups you get in SA2 should be in kart racing. AND RIDING IN AIR SOMETIMES and in air loops, do things like that. Long tracks, Large amount of tracks to choose from. All chacters can transform into there super or hyper self by doing something different in kart racing. But in all the other modes(All characters in kart racing that i mentioned should be usable in all other modes(Amy, big, E 102 and E 103 and the others, and they all transfor super and collecting 50 rings like before and not transform if shielded, each have own special abilities(like in SONIC AND KNUCLES for Sega Genesis)(look at that Sonic game that has all sega genesis sonic games in it, sonic and knuckles and stuff, withsonic in 3D FOR THE FIRST TIME, FOR SEGA SATURN), more couses, another course for shadow, more chao gardens, etc). Do that. All this should be made TO BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET SITE(HOMEPAGE)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; PS: In SONIC AND KNUCLES(SONIC 3 OR 4(FOR SEGA GENESIS)). Each character had his own specialabilities when transformed, it was SONIC: FLASH ATTACK, TAILS: ANIMALS SURROUNDING HIM AND ATTACK EMIMIES NEARBY, AND KNUCKLES: GLIDE FASTER AND SHAKE THE WALLS (OR FLOOR) HE LANDS ON(MAYBE KNOCKING DOWN OR KILLING EMEMIES(OR MAKING THEM GO &quot;POOF&quot;)). So do something like that.<br>
