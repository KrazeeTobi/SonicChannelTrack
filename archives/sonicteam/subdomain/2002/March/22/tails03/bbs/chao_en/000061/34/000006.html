&gt; &gt; LOL you are one funny guy, Ultroid Blue! I had a similar incident over something more trivial.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; A chao of mine continually slept.<br>
&gt; &gt; All day.<br>
&gt; &gt; All night.<br>
&gt; &gt; I couldnt feed it, i couldnt give it animals or Chaos Drives, and so it was just using space up on my Chao File. And so, donning EggMan's Red and black suit, along with that ridiculous moustache, I entered the Chao Garden, and picked it up. It wasnt suspecting a thing, and was more than pleased to see Dr. Robotnik, as it was a Dark Chao raised by him.<br>
&gt; &gt; I took the Chao to the unnocupied-at the time- Dark Garden, and placed him on the floor, giving him one last chance to get off his fat lazy be-hind and do something.<br>
&gt; &gt; But no.<br>
&gt; &gt; He lies down and starts snoring.<br>
&gt; &gt; In a complete and total infuriated moment, i ran at the Chao and kicked it in the nose. He went flying in to the blood-red water, and swam back to the edge. Then, to my mixed amusement and anger, he returned to his slumber. Looking around to see we were alone, I snuck up on him, and slapped him round the head. Then, before he even hit the floor, I was on him again. I booted him so hard they heard the dull thump on Mars, and the Chao was sent careening in to a tombstone. I thought &quot;thats enough, he wont sleep any more.&quot; And i went to leave. As i reached the doorway, I heard a famillear noise.<br>
&gt; &gt; Snoring.<br>
&gt; &gt; So I proceeded to knock 7 shades out of the little fegger, put him on my oldest and most broken VMU and smashed his face in with a hammer.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I dont regret my actions, laziness among Chao should NOT be totlerated.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Yes, That's it friend. Letting go of our<br>
&gt; anger makes us more human in the long<br>
&gt; run. That lazy chao should've been more<br>
&gt; considerate towards you. It sealed it's<br>
&gt; own fate.<br>
<br>
I miss the VMU though... the Chao caused me to bludgeon it, it didn't do anything wrong....<br>
<br>
*bursts into tears* WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?!?
