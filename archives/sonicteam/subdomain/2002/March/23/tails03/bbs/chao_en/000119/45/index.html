Glitch: Stuck in wall:<br>
As Sonic or Shadow, enter the regular Chao Garden. From the entrance walk right against the wall while pushing against it with your side. If done correctly you will walk into a little groove in the wall. You will do the spin attack even though B was not pressed. Note: Be careful because you may hit your Chao. <br>

<br>
Glitch: Fall endlessly in Final Rush:<br>
While as Sonic running away from the burning rocks in the last part of Final Rush, run at full speed and make sure you do not get hit by the rocks. Then, jump to your left or your right, whichever you are closer to. Hold A to make a full jump and then press the direction that you want to jump off of. You will notice that you just jumped over the barrier. You will now fall endlessly to your death. However, if you got hit by one of the rocks on the way out, there will be a strange aura attacking you as you fall. You may die before you reach the atmosphere. <br>

Glitch: Invisible snowboard:<br>
In the Metal Harbor hero level, press Y on controller B. Sonic will be snowboarding, yet will have no snowboard under his feet.<br>

Glitch: Get the Air Board at the start: <br>
To get the board early, press Y on controller B.<br>

<br>
Glitch: Wrong camera angle:<br>
In the City Escape level as Sonic, find the part near the end with an under-pass that you need to somersault under. When you do that, quickly jump. If you are lucky, the camera will be in the other direction, showing you where the ramp's and speed things are located. This may require multiple tries.<br>

<br>
Glitch: Frozen Shadow:<br>
Shadow's Ancient Light is required for this trick. Once you have it, go to the Final Chase level. When you meet your first shielded robot outside a tunnel, stand as far from it as possible and use Light Attack. Shadow will go to the top of the roof and freeze in the Spin Dash position. Unless you press B, he will continue to be that way. <br>

<br>
Glitch: Frozen Sonic:<br>
Sonic's Ancient Light is required for this trick. Once you have it, go to Pyramid Cave level. Use the Light Attack on the fourth gamma robot from the Bounce Bracelet. Sonic should destroy the robot and stay in one of the corners, frozen in the Spin Dash position and flicke. Press B to revert back to normal.<br>

<br>
When you get Sonic's Ancient Light, go to the Crazy Gadget level. Proceed until you get to the last checkpoint near the door to the boxes room. When you get in the boxes room, intentionally die. You will appear to be back at the last checkpoint. The door behind you will be shut. Stand directly next to it and use the Ancient Light. You will be frozen unless you press B.<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; Final Rush<br>
Just before the 2'nd check point you must run a rail with two gaps in it.  Just jump  the first gap, don't crouch or push with stick... while in the air hold down &quot;X&quot; and when you land you'll burn across the second gap and continue onto platform , through dash panal and stop whirling in a blue blur . Push forward hard and let up on &quot;X&quot;. You should take off like a rocket and blur through checkpoint, tunnel and run full power into the wall leading to the 3 boxes  with a Chaos guarding. Sonic dissapears at this point. the joystick works ok and you can walk him out of the middle of that wall like he meant to do that. Pepero<br>
