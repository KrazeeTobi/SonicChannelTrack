i was looking threw some sites and i found 2 ways 2 get sonic chao 1 said give ur chao lots of green chao drives and green animals(u can tell the colour, by the colour of the border around the picture for the animal)<br>
i constantly looked after my little chao and giving it loads of green stuff. at last it sat down and began to evovle i was so x sited i herd there VERY fast .. i herd the music play and asoon as the chao was visible after evolving ... als it was it had bigger feet and a horn on its head :(<br>
<br>
arg for gods sake lol<br>
<br>
oh well im gonna try this outher method.. if u wanna try it here is the formular<br>
<br>
1.Feed it with sonic only and pet it all times when its a baby<br>
<br>
2.feed it just 10Dragons,5 Skeleton dogs and 5 bats IN THAT ORDER<br>
<br>
i bet ur woundering where thease are... dragons are in the room flying in the corner where you find the mystic melody for knuckles <br>
<br>
(goto wild conyon from the stage select from the start go str8 and ride up the air thingy, go right and folow that way till you reach a spot where a chao as sitting on like a statue grap the wall behind its head and climb up and you will see a poster on the wall a big 1 hmmmm dosnt it look very formiliar? dig a bit down from the centre of the picture to go threw it here is knuckles mystic melody turn around grab the wall climp up and left and get the dragon. press start then goto restart go there again and anouther dragon will b there)<br>
<br>
SKELETON DOG: there is 1 woundering around the church on the level for knuckles called pumpkin hill.<br>
<br>
BAT: there is 1 woundering around the church aswell oh yea btw u can get loads of bats from some of robotnicks level where you haveto get into the base and try noto fall in the sand.<br>
<br>
3.keep feeding it the right way and u get a sonic chao (its very fast)<br>
<br>
<br>
ok there you have it, if you try it and it workds, dosnt work can u tell me pls? :) on the chao bbs...<br>
<br>
arg i feel like my arms are gonna drop off now lol

Nice!... You've convinced me. I also have had the same reaction as you after spending 4+ hrs. collecting only to get BLAAAAAHHHH... or even worse it died. My best racer I made with a neutral chao tended by eggman and knuckles. <br>
1.  I maxxed out SWIM to 999(got seals with Shadow @ Radical Highway; jump off first rail just before reaching bridge and veer left to very beginning of bridge)<br>
2.  Next I maxxed out PWR to 999(got bear at SKY RAIL with Shadow; behind post... jump to right from crouch on rail and stop)<br>
3.  Maxxed RUN with Knuckles at Pumkin MT with bonedogs; glide to left from start to cannon, cannon to highest point and glide to bonedog in cemetery.<br>
4.  Maxxed FLY with bats using eggman at Sand Ocean; turn and come back at the beginning, jump down carefully to the small platform at the very beginning... don't fall off 'till you pick up bat.<br>
I hit START button and then EXIT and come back in each level 'till I get 10 of animal.<br>
You will have to add a few more bonedogs when you finish to get your legs back.<br>
Unfortunatly the chao is very old at this point and will probably reegg if you don't isolate it in a garden you reserve for that purpose(that's what I do; then you can race or post in daycare for emblems or modification). I wish I knew what would make them evolve... not had many do that. WHY?      <br>
Thanks for the detail. &lt;pepero@rcn.com&gt;

WOOHOO the chao just evolved! and MAN its fast :)<br>
<br>
make shore though... you keep it not dark or light so when it evolves it will still have a dot on its head. or it wont work properly<br>
<br>
when it evolved it turned green and some bits pink, its fast :) i know that green animals/drives make ur chao run very fast :) so i gave it loads of green aniamls and drives.<br>
now its realy fast i actaly beet the 1st hero and dark race's and i came 5th in the gold and silver chao race :D<br>
<br>
oh btw if u where woundering i know a easy way 2 get green animals/drives <br>
<br>
goto green forest level as sonic(or sumthing forest lol)<br>
go str8 ahead from the start go accros the booster and u find 3 robots kill them all, if there is green drive/s pick them/it up now you will see on your left a mushroom walk upto it retate your view and you see anouther mush room, pick this one up and a green animal pops out now restart the level and do the same again and again and again.<br>
<br>
btw if you find a animal restart the level and it will re-apear making it easyer to get loads. <br>
<br>
oh well, im gonna try the sonic chao once again i was reading some sites and it says use both hero and dark chars so it dosnt go dark or light so the dot stays on its head when it evolves.<br>
<br>
oh yea the shadow chao looks very easy 2 do...<br>
<br>
get a new chao or a baby chao use a dark char make it black/dark give it loads of green chao drives and green animals (cheeters and rabbits) make shore you dont touch it at all with a hero char when it evolves it will look a little like shadow..<br>
to make it look more like shadow now feed it loads of YELLOW chao drives(no yellow animals) and the red stripes will apear and then become more clear to see :)
