I would put my chaos in daycare, but I can't refresh it every day like you have to, I don't have time!!!  O and in that recipe u gave (the 999 stat baby one), the chao doesn't have to be fat.  Swim and then power is the fat recipe, thats why it came out fat.  Change that order around and it won't be fat!  I'm not saying theres anything wrong with it being a sumo chao though, i'm making a dark sumo eggman chao right now :)!

You don't have to refresh like you did with SA1, once it's posted it stays there until YOU replace it with another. You are allowed three chao max. I download the weird chao &quot;Picasso&quot; for raw material on making my oddball chao. It was posted early in daycare and no one has to refresh it, I must have downloaded doz.'s of copies... not all experiments go well! I love that Picasso tho'! <br>
The only way I can seem to max everthing legally is to start with SEALS. I've tried lots of other ways and can't seem to keep him alive after the first 999.<br>
PLEASE post your SUMO when you get it. &lt;pepero@rcn.com&gt;

Cool!!!  Next time I get the chance I'll post the sumo chao named ShadowX when its finished evolving and some other really cool chao!  ShadowX is my main chao and has been reborn once.  He is Dark swimming/Power (incomplete right now) and has all bear parts.  Very sleek looking, like a Shadowq who ate a little too much and put on a wetsuit and died his hair stripes blue.  His body is aquamarine instead of black but his head is black and his spikes go way up.  He has a very cool kinda happy personality.  Whats your main chao like?  <br>
<br>
PS i'm not talking about editor chaos, i don't like using it, it doesn't feel fair and I don't want to take any chance of deleting my gardens.<br>
<br>
PPS ShadowX's stats are like 163 for Swim and 120 for Power and 0 for flying and 60 for running I think.
