Sonic Advance: The latest chao news<br>
   As you know, Sonic Advance, Sega's first game on a Nintendo system, was delayed untill January 23.  It has now unfortunetly been delayed again untill February 5.  As for chaos, it has been confirmed that there WILL be chaos in SA.  Nintendo Magazine says there will be a &quot;Tiny Chao Garden&quot;.  They also showed a picture.  The chaos will have the power of textual speech, and you will be able to hatch a fresh baby chao and raise its stats on your GBA and earn it exotic fruits from mini games.  You will also be  able to transfer your chao from SA2 Battle to and from your GBA (though as you will read, SA2B may not me all its cracked up to be).  Sonic Advance will also have a single and multti pack link for multi player play and four playable characters, including Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy.<br>
<br>
SA2 Battle: The debate of DC/Xbox/GCN/PS2<br>
   I have seen many pictures of the upcoming game &quot;Sonic Adventure 2 Battle&quot;, and I have to say, I'm not impressed.  The pictures I saw looked dull and flat and even having noticible pixles, compared to the DC version of the game.  And those were the story scenes and game play scenes!!!  I know it's not just the photos, because I have seen many photos of other games from the same source and they were all very clear.  It is a PROVEN FACT that Xbox has better garphics due to its built in harddrive, which also eliminates the need for memory cards!!!  That saves you about $60 or more on memory cards right there, thinking that your probably going to need to buy 3 or more eventually.  But enough about MY opinion, lets hear your opinion!  The debate between GCN, PS2, and DC is still raging!  Just please don't forget about your Dreamcast and its SA2!!!  Trust me, you may get tired of playing SA2 Battle when you start having to look at Gamecube's... less-then perfect... controller while your playing :).....<br>
<br>
Sonic Team's developement for other systems<br>
   Aside from Sonic Advance and SA2 Battle, Sega and Sonic Team are releasing several new titles for varios systems.  Sega has already released Chu Chu Rocket for the GBA.  And Sonic Team has definate plans to release Phantasy Star Online for the GCN and Xbox!!!  Thats gonna be great, but to tell you the truth, I've never played it before!  Looking forward to play it on my Xbox, though.<br>
<br>
The Chao E.d.i.t.o.r Fever: Creation or Corruption?<br>
   There seems to have been a surge of interest in the chao e.d.i.t.o.r, or Chao Maker, recently.  let me tell you all AGAIN, THE E.D.I.T.O.R IS BAD!!!  I don't care about opinions here, THE_E.D.I.T.O.R_IS_WRONG!!!  Not only does it sometimes corrupt memory cards and chao files, it takes all the fun away from chao raising!  I have known at least 3 people to say they would never raise chaos again after using it.  Don't let that happen to you!!!  Stay away from the editor and convince others to do so!!!  I don't care if I have to start a full scale chao rebellian, THE E.D.I.T.O.R MUST BE STOPPED NOW!!!  As the American Colonists said, join or die!!!  Or... at least lose all your chaos and memory card data.<br>
<br>
Weekly Chao Recipies<br>
   Every week I will be putting special and original chao recipies here.  If you have any suggestions, tell me and I will post them in next weeks issue!!!<br>
<br>
The most real-looking Super Sonic Chao yet:<br>
   First, get a Gold chao either from the Black Market or by importing a SA1 Gold chao and mating it.  Its baby will remain gold.  Keep it neutral (pet it equally with Hero and Dark), and give it all green animals and chao drives (run e <br>
