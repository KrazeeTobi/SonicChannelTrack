As much as i can try talking to them, i dont quite have the power to ban such users that i know to be vulgar.  I wish that some users can be banned by another piece of personal information, because currently they can just use another email to get back on.  It upsets me that i have to spend whole days straight just trying to control these users.  I also think it is justified to stop the discussion of the chao editor, it is just a very cheap way to make them.  I think it is better if a gamer would take care of a chao as its own, instead of trying to make a business of giving out hacked chao.  Same with the hacking devices many people use on the sonic games and pso, it is very unfair to other users to have their items stolen and files corrupted, not to mention the problems with the rankings on Sonic Adventure.  I think that these bbs are finally getting a grip, we have not experienced a flamer/flooder for quite some time now, maybe for even 100 pages of the expert bbs.  I think that it was a great idea to have an official bbs, it has really helped users.  In fact, users of this bbs have shot up on the Sonic Top 50(a listing of the best fan sites).<br>
<br>
Where other teams leave their games in the dust, you people really support us with updates, even after you have moved on to bigger and better things.<br>
<br>
Users: not to be rude, but i think they would receive your messages if you emailed them<br>
<br>
PS: If its notmuch trouble (i know you've been working on many things and couldn't update every friday), please put up the Shadow theme, many users really, really want it.<br>
<br>
Thanks again!
