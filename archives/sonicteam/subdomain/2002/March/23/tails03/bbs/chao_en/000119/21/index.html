1.	City Escape<br>
<br>
After the first checkpoint, go down the road and grind the rail to build <br>
up speed. At the end of the rail, run up the wall and the gold beetle is <br>
there.<br>
<br>
2.	Wild Canyon<br>
<br>
Go up the wind vent and glide to the left. In the area with the big head <br>
half buried in the sand, go down and walk to the area with the thing that <br>
goes up and then falls. The gold beetle is on the other side.<br>
<br>
3.	Prison Lane<br>
<br>
After the second checkpoint, pass the gauntlet of gates and enemies. <br>
You'll come to two lifts, one directly after the other. Go up them. You'll <br>
come to one more gate. Pass through and as you step onto the next lift the <br>
gold beetle will appear nearby in plain sight.<br>
<br>
4.	Metal Harbor<br>
<br>
After the first checkpoint, hit the springs and you'll come to a platform <br>
with a string of beetles. Home in on the first four, then, instead of <br>
going forward, go to the deft and down, THEN home in on the next beetle. <br>
Following it will be a 1-UP container and the gold beetle.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you take shortcuts, you might miss the first checkpoint. First <br>
find the gold beetle then get used to the shortcuts.<br>
<br>
5.	Green Forest<br>
<br>
After the first loop-the-loop, there are three robots. The gold beetle is <br>
there in plain sight when you home in on at least one of them.<br>
<br>
6.	Pumpkin Hill<br>
<br>
Coming soon! (Near impossible to find)<br>
<br>
7.	Mission Street<br>
<br>
After the first pulley in the level, jump on to one of the hexagonal <br>
platforms that go up and down. Once on the fifth one, the gold beetle will <br>
appear in plain sight.<br>
<br>
8.	Aquatic Mine<br>
<br>
Man, this ones easy. On the floor you start on, just glide to the opposite <br>
end, then to the left corner. It's there.<br>
<br>
9.	Route 101<br>
<br>
Well, to find the NEXT gold beetle, you have to beat this level, go to the <br>
next level, and look for it there, or you can look at the FAQ, under <br>
Hidden Base. =P<br>
<br>
10.  Hidden Base<br>
<br>
Right before the first checkpoint, you'll find a destroyable block. Blow <br>
it up and go down the path. Take the pulley and the gold beetle will be <br>
visible at the end of the pulley ride.<br>
<br>
11.  Pyramid Cave<br>
<br>
After the third checkpoint, run through the two loops and you'll be in a <br>
room with an enemy and a spring. Don't go on the spring. Instead, go to <br>
the right and the gold beetle is there.<br>
<br>
12.	Death Chamber<br>
<br>
In the first room, go to the right and break the metal boxes. Dig through <br>
the picture and, in the new room, destroy the spike enemy. In that same <br>
room, hit the button to launch the missile into the crates. The gold <br>
beetle is near where the crates used to be. <br>
<br>
13.  Eternal Engine<br>
<br>
After the fifth checkpoint, in the zero-g floaty, enemy-infested area, <br>
jump on the platform. It'll fall from under your feet and you'll start <br>
floating. The gold beetle will appear. Try to get it. It's not too easy.<br>
<br>
14.  Meteor Herd<br>
<br>
Coming Soon! (This level is MASSIVE!)<br>
<br>
15.	Crazy Gadget<br>
<br>
After the fourth checkpoint, take the warp tube, cross the string of <br>
electric beetles, continue going until you come a room with a Chaos-type <br>
enemy. Kill it, and hit a spring.<br>
Grind down the upside-down rail and you'll come to a room with another <br>
Chaos enemy. Hit a spring and go on to the ledge. STOP! Don't run. <br>
Instead, Lightspeed Dash across the row of rings to avoid falling into the <br>
pit. In this room, break the metal boxes until you find a spring. Hit it <br>
and you'll fall to the floor. Kill this Chaos enemy to open the locked <br>
door. Now Lightspeed Dash to the next room. Here, there is a Bubble shaped <br>
Chaos enemy. Kill it and continue. Avoid or kill the electric beetle and <br>
grab on to the ceiling rail and at the end the gold beetle will be in this <br>
room.(whew :D|)<br>
<br>
16.	Final Rush<br>
<br>
Coming Soon (once again, this level is MASSIVE!)<br>
<br>
Dark Side<br>
---------<br>
<br>
1.	Iron Gate<br>
<br>
Coming Soon!<br>
<br>
2.	Dry Lagoon<br>
<br>
Coming Soon!<br>
<br>
3.	Sand Ocean<br>
<br>
Coming Soon! (Man, these are hard to find!)<br>
<br>
4.	Radical Highway<br>
<br>
After the second checkpoint, go down the double-loop and jump on the ramp. <br>
On the platform you land on, don't jump at the swinging bar. Instead run <br>
up the edge of the bridge. You can hit the bar to swing on, but make sure <br>
you hit the bar directly to th <br>
