Does anyone know how many times &quot;BIG&quot; shows up. Is he always in the same place? I just went through all the SA2 1'st levels for the third time and it seem like I keep seeing him in spots I missed the other times. He also (BIG that is) sits on my computer desk &quot;cubby&quot; with froggy and some gold rings.

In the Tails level where you are running from the police and you first get your hover ability, Big the Cat can be seen again. There is a part in the level where you need to knock a column over in order to use it as a step to reach a higher level, from which you hover over to a platform with a police barricade and two robots. If you miss the platform and fall in the hole, you will see Big the Cat sitting on the girders underneath the platform. <br>

After you complete Final Hazard, and Shadow and Sonic get ready to use the Chaos Control, Big will sometimes be seen floating around in the background.<br>

Play as Rouge and do the battle against Knuckles. At the end when you and Knuckles are saying &quot;Whew&quot;, Big will walk across the beam behind you.<br>

I was just in Rouge's Security Hall level, and I though I saw Big being floated above some of the fans if you get the camera angle just and can kinda see thoguh the floor.  He is against a misty backround (cause its kinda off screen).  This was all kinda vague though, so it might not be there but I think I've see it several times before.
