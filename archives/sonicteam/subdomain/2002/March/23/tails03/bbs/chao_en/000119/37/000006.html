LOOK WHAT I JUST FOUND!!<br>
:D<br>
<br>
Hint: Big the Cat appearances: <br>
<br>
Aquatic Mines level: You can also find Big the Cat when the water is all the way up and you look through the cage with the caution side. <br>
Information in this section was contributed by Timothy O'Brien. <br>
Cannon's Core level (as Tails): When you take the first elevator down, you will see Big below hanging on to the wall to the right (or left)<br>
Information in this section was contributed by The Insane One. <br>
Cannon's Core level (as Knuckles): Big can been found inside of the wall near where you find a lot of lasers close to the ending (next to the ground that is green on the right side). He is waving to you.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by superiour sonic. <br>
City Escape level: Big the Cat appears after the last corner in the G.U.N. truck vs. Sonic scene. look For him at the right of the screen, running downhill on the sidewalk away from the truck. <br>
Information in this section was contributed by masonbee, Cassis90, and Timothy O'Brien. <br>
Colony's Core (as Sonic): Note: this is the last part. When you are going down the slides, jump on the pillar to your left (the one with the timestop switch). Look across from you on the other pillar to see Big.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by Ben Schroeder. <br>
Crazy Gadget level: Reach the room with all the color boxes. When you first get to the yellow one, jump down to land on another yellow piece. Big will be jumping up and down on it -- you can reach him.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by The Insane One. <br>
Crazy Gadgets (hard difficulty): Big will be hanging on to the blue block instead of on the yellow block.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by The Insane One. <br>
Cosmic Wall level (as Dr. Eggman): When you are on the second train-like rail car immediately after you reach the top of the first hill, spin the camera angle around to see behind Dr. Eggman. Big will be sitting on the corner of the platform behind you. <br>
Information in this section was contributed by The Insane One. <br>
Death Chamber level (as Knuckles): Go in the middle, where the big engine is located. Climb around it in one location and you can see Big the Cat inside of it.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by Timothy O'Brien. <br>
Dry Lagoon level (as Rouge): Go to the turtle and rescue him. Then, go to the other place with the underwater swimming turtle. Grab hold of him and on the way to the under prison, look on the bottom right of the screen to see the lower half of Big sticking out of the sand. Look carefully and make sure you are entering the tunnel, and not the exit.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by Kpetty45fan and Knuckles87654321. <br>
Egg Quarters level: Go to the green room with the eight pillars. In the middle of the room is a Mystic Melody ruin. Stand on top of it and jump up. On the wall to the left (or right), Big is holding on under a flower.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by The Insane One. <br>
Final Chase: At the last continue, Big will be directly in front of you, inside the green gravity cylinder.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by superiour sonic. <br>
Final Rush: Look for a line that you can grind on. It is a straight line that has a spring attached to it. Hit the spring and jump up to see Big on platform, dancing just like in Sonic Adventure when he catches the frog. You can also touch him.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by superiour sonic. <br>
Green Forest level (as Sonic): Big can be seen (barely) on a platform against a tree, immediately after the part when you home attack two enemies that are floating above platforms. Look to the left to see the large platform against a tree. Big is a little difficult to see.<br>
Information in this section was contributed by The Insane One. <br>
Hidden Base level (as Tails): When you reach the entrance to the first pyramid, look to the right. Big will be sitting on a metal girder that is around a large statue against the wall.<br>

Iron Gate level (as Dr. Eggman): Whe <br>
