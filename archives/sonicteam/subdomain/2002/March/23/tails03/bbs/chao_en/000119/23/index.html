[2].     CHAO BASICS<br>
     In this section of the FAQ, I shall go into the basics of raising chao,<br>
     these are things that you should know before you enter into the chao<br>
     garden for the first time.  It is my opinion however, that you should<br>
     completely finish the entire SA2 main game before you ever start working<br>
     with chao.  This gives you the opportunity to have access to all of the<br>
     games levels, which you will need in order to raise effective and fun<br>
     chao.  Not to mention, it is the only way that you can get access to the<br>
     chao kindergarten or to switch between gardens.  I recommend also that you<br>
     use either Knuckles or Rouge to raise your chao with, as they are less<br>
     likely to accidentally strike the chao, which leads to the most important<br>
     aspect of chao raising, never strike your chao.<br>
<br>
[2.1].   HATCHING<br>
     There are three ways that you can hatch a chao, only one, however, is the<br>
     correct way.  When you reach the chao garden for the first time, you will<br>
     notice that there are two chao eggs.  Walk up to one and when the action<br>
     button says &quot;pick&quot; you should pick the chao up, and hold that button down.<br>
     After you rock the egg a few times, sit the egg back down, and a happy<br>
     chao will pop out.  You could also let the egg sit and hatch on its own,<br>
     this takes longer, and the chao is not as happy, or you could throw the<br>
     egg against a wall, I advise you not to do this, if you ever want your<br>
     chao to like you, at all.<br>
<br>
[2.2].   FEEDING<br>
     After your chao have been hatched, the first thing that you should do is<br>
     to give you chao one of the tree fruits that you find on the trees located<br>
     in the garden.  In order to do this, you walk up to a tree and press the<br>
     action button (or &quot;B&quot; button).  Your character will then grab hold of the<br>
     tree and you can shake it by moving the analog control back to forward or<br>
     side-to-side.  If there is a full-grown tree on the fruit, it will shake<br>
     as the tree shakes, and will eventually fall off.  Once this happens,<br>
     simply pick the fruit up and hand it to the chao, and he will chomp down.<br>
     There are also two other aspects to collecting food for your chao; both<br>
     of these require your playing chao adventure 2 on your VMU.  Details on<br>
     how to obtain these items will be dealt with there, but here I shall<br>
     discuss what to do with the items once you have procured them.  If you<br>
     have won a seed or a fruit in Chao adventure 2, first make sure the<br>
     VMU is in a controller, you should walk up to the VMU machine located in<br>
     the chao garden and step on the button.  This will bring up a menu.  You<br>
     should then select the correct VMU, and a list of everything that you<br>
     have attained during you playing of Chao adventure 2 will come up,<br>
     simply highlight the item (or chao) that you want to bring out of the VMU<br>
     and press the &quot;A&quot; button.  This should leave the item/chao highlighted,<br>
     even if you move the cursor.  You can then select any other items that<br>
     you would like.  Once you have selected all of the items that you would<br>
     like, move the cursor down to the &quot;select&quot; button and all of the items<br>
     will come out of the VMU machine.  If the item was a fruit, simply pick<br>
     it up and carry it over to your chao, as you would a normal tree fruit.<br>
     If it is a seed, you should carry it over to a chao that has won the<br>
     watering pale and the shovel in the races (see the racing section for more<br>
     information) and the chao will do the rest.  You will then have a new tree<br>
     in the garden with better fruit.  The fruit from these tree's are better<br>
     for increasing your chao's stamina (see stats section for more details),<br>
     though they do die after time, however, your chao may water the tree after<br>
     it has been planted, this will elongate the life-span of the tree.  You may<br>
     have up to six extra trees in any given garden at a time.<br>
<br>
Fruits:<br>
      Triangle Fruit - A triangle shaped fruit<br>
      Square Fruit   - A square shaped fruit<br>
