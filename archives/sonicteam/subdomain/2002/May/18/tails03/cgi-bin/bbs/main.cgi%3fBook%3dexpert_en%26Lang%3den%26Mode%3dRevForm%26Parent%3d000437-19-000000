Person 1: Hey, come over here and look at this!
Person 2: Wow, what is it?
Person 1: I don't know, you think it's dead?
Person 2: I wonder if we should help im'.
Person 1 &amp; 2: Gah! It moved!
*Groggily props up into sitting position*
Shadow: W-w-w-where am I?
Person 1 &amp; 2: Whoa, It talks!
Shadow: (Standing up) Well of course I can talk! I am the ultimate life form, after all.
Person 1: Who are you?
Shadow: My name is Shadow, and right now, I need to find someone.
*Runs off without any further conversation*
~Back in Station Square~
Jet: Well, Come and get some!
Crimson: Give it up wile you still can, Jet, you know you can't win!
Jet: I should say the same to you, Crimson!
*Begin to fight*
Crimson: (Dodging kick)Hah, you've gone soft, Jet!
Jet: I don't think so! Check this!
*Pulls out small device*
Crimson: Whoa! What's happening?
*Earthquake!*
Jet: Take this!
Sonic: What's going on here?
Tails: Hey Sonic, does that guy over there look familiar to you?
Sonic: Wuh? Jeez! It's Shadow!?
Shadow: Hey, no fair starting the party without me! What the? Two Sonics?
Sonic &amp; Tails: Don't ask.
Jet: So, you aren't dead after all, eh? Well, take this!
*Punches Shadow*
Shadow: Jeez, who the heck do you think you are?
Jet: I am Jet, the REAL ultimate life form, and you, Shadow, are the obsolete prototype!
Shadow: What? This is too weird! And how do you know my name?
Jet: Don't worry about it, you won't live long enough to find out!
Shadow: I have no idea who you are, but that's not gonna happen!
*Gets ready to fight*
Jets's Wrist Communicator: Sir, we have located a De-chaos Emerald nearby.
Jet: I'l be right there, don't let it out of your radar zone! Sorry fellas, I'll have to destroy you all later!
*Runs off causing strong gust to arise.
Sonic: What was that all about? And WHO IS JET!?
Crimson: I can answer that. For your first question, it's a case of mistaken identity. For nuber two, Jet is an evil super hedgehog created by Dr. Ivo robotnik.
Sonic: Oh, not eggman again!
Crimson: So, you know who he is?
Sonic: A little to well.
Crimson: Anyway, as I was saying, Jet is a creation of Ivo Robotnik. I stole the plans to try and find a weakness, but so far all I found out is he was built according to the specs. of some guy named Sonic.
Sonic: He was built according to me!?
Crimson: Ah, so you're Sonic? That would explain why he looks like you.
Sonic: Jeez, he's always coming up with some egghead plan. Come on, we may as well just go stop im' now.
Crimson: Hold it, mister! He's built according to your specs., but that doesn't mean he'll be easy to beat. In case you haven't noticed, he packs a few heavy-artillery items.
Tails: Ah, that guy couldn't beat Sonic if he had a high velocity pulse cannon, let alone that little earthquake thingy.
Crimson: As a matter of fact, he does.
Tails: .....
Crimson: Weren't you wondering what was in that backpack?
Tails: Oh... On second thought...
Sonic: Well, what are we going to do?
Crimson: I've been keeping a secret weapon in my home in the Echinos Jungle, so let's go there.
Sonic: What is it?
Crimson: You'll see when e get there, now everyone follow me!
*All go to the Jungle*
~In Jet's base~
Jet: Kinidos, I'm paying you good money for this job, so don't mess it up!
Kinidos: Yeah, yeah, I heard ya, get the Emerald, blah, blah, blah.
Jet: If you weren't the only guy good enough to do this, I'd...
Kinidos: You'd what?
Jet: Just GO!
*Walks out*
Kinidos: That guy's such an idiot... I'm gonna get those hundred thousand bucks without lifting a finger... heh heh heh...
*Pulls out large glass jewel*
Kinidos: I'll just wait a convincing while, then I'll pop up with this and grab the cash.
~In the Echinos Jungle~
Crimson: In here!
Sonic: What is it?
Crimson: Hit that switch over there.
*Hits switch, door opens*
Crimson: Now, my secret weapon is this!
*holds out large jewel*
Sonic: A Chaos Emerald!?
Crimson: Correction. De-chaos Emerald.
Tails: De-chaos Emerald?
Crimson: There's seven of em' in all, and they're just as powerful as the Chaos Emeralds.
