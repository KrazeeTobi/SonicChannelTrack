~In the Echinos Jungle~<br>
De-chaos 5: Now, you shall feel my power!<br>
Sonic: I don't think so!(Rushes up to De-chaos and throws a punch)<br>
De-chaos: (Easily shrugs off the hit) Hah! You are pathetic! My turn! (Grabs Sonic by the foot and picks him up) Take this! (Tosses Sonic into a tree)<br>
Sonic: Ohh... Man... (Stands up rubbing head) (Comes to senses) Grrr... I'll get you! (Rushes up to attack)<br>
De-chaos: You cannot beat me! (Picks up Sonic again)<br>
Crimson: Wuh? (Pulls out De-chaos Emerald. It is glowing brightly)<br>
De-chaos: Aha! (Extends arm to grab it)<br>
Crimson: Gah! Darn it!<br>
De-chaos: (Engulfs Emerald, now he is De-chaos 6) Now, Super Sonic, you were born from my power, and now I'm gonna take it back! Energy absorb!<br>
*Sonic loses his aquamarine color and reverts to normal*<br>
*Sonic is left limp and powerless because De-chaos absorbed too much energy*<br>
De-chaos: Only one more to go!<br>
*Drops Sonic, and walks off in the direction of the ocean.*<br>
Crimson: Is he...?<br>
Tails: No, he's still alive, but barely. There'a only one thing I can think of that'll save im'.<br>
Crimson: What?<br>
Tails: We gotta get im' to angel island and use the Chaos Emeralds' energy.<br>
Shadow: But that's gotta be at least two hundred miles away from here!<br>
Tails: I know, but luckily,I installed a remote call device on the Tornado. (Pulls out a remote and presses a series of buttons.) Thet oughta do it.<br>
*Suddenly, there is a sound of a jet engine*<br>
Tails: Grab Sonic and hop in!<br>
*Place Sonic into the plane and speed off in the direction of angel island*<br>
~Angel Island~<br>
Tails: Come on, let's move!<br>
*Suddenly, Knuckles walks up*<br>
Knuckles: What's up?<br>
Tails: No time to chat Knux, we got a crisis on our hands!<br>
Knuckles: What? What's wrong?<br>
Tails: It's Sonic, he's hurt real bad. We need the Chaos Emeralds, now!<br>
Knuckles: Follow me!<br>
*Leads them to the Emerald altar.*<br>
Knuckles: Here we are, get im' up there, quick!<br>
Tails: Thanks, Knux! Woah!<br>
Knuckles: What?<br>
Tails: Isn't that c-c-c-c-c...<br>
Knuckles: Chaos? Yeah, but there's nothin' to worry about anymore, he's good, remember?<br>
Taisl: Oh, whoops, I forgot, haven't seen im' in a while, ya know?<br>
*Brings Sonic up to the Master Emerald*<br>
Tails: OOF!<br>
*Suddenly, Tails runs smack into an invisible barrier surrounding the center of the altar.*<br>
Tails: What the? Where'd this barrier come from?<br>
Knuckles: What're you talking about? (Runs up) OOF! Oh, that's what you're talking about.<br>
Tails: What is it?<br>
Knuckles: I have no idea, but it wasn't here before.<br>
Tails: This is NOT good. Without the Master Emerald, we can't help Sonic.<br>
Knuckles: And I have no idea how to get past this.<br>
Tails: Hmmm...<br>
~Meanwhile, in Station Square~<br>
De-chaos 6: So, this is where the last emerald is. Getting it from these humans will be easy like Sunday morning.<br>
*Bursts into building*<br>
People:Ahhh! A monster!<br>
De-chaos 6: Tell me where the emerald is now!<br>
*Point toward a large metal vault*<br>
De-chaos: Now I will finally be perfected! (Breaks open door to safe and spots the emerald)<br>
*Grabs the Emerald.*<br>
De-chaos: (While transforming) Ahahahahaha! Now, I am perfected!<br>
*Grows to immense size and resembles a snake with arms*<br>
Perfect De-chaos: All will bow down to my power or perish! Starting with the friends of Sonic!<br>
*Slithers off toward the ocean, and swims to Angel island*
