Now that we've got that down, let's begin.<br>
~In the Echinos Jungle~(Echinos is greek for hedgehog)<br>
Azura: Come on, it fell over here!<br>
Kiro: Do you even know where you're going?<br>
Azura: I know exactly where I'm going!<br>
Dansm: Yeah, that's what you said last time you led us on a wild goose chase. And the time before that, and the time before that, and the time...<br>
Azura &amp; Kiro: WE GET THE POINT!<br>
Azura: Hey, there it is!<br>
All: What the?<br>
*Screaming*<br>
*Kiro &amp; Dansm get away*<br>
Kiro: What was that?<br>
Dansm: I don't know, but whatever it was, it got Azura!<br>
Kiro: What do you think it wanted?<br>
Dansm: The only thing I can think of is our De-chaos emeralds.<br>
Kiro: Oh, yeah, I forgot we had these.(Pulls out Jewel)<br>
Dansm: We gotta tell Crimson about this!<br>
Kiro: yeah!<br>
*Run in the direction of station square*<br>
~Station square~<br>
Tails: Oh, man, I don't have enough money to get a ticket to Chao in Space.<br>
Sonic: Tails! You've already seen it eighteen times!<br>
Tails: Nineteenth time is the charm!<br>
Sonic: Tails, shouldn't you be using that noggin of yours to build some new invention?<br>
*Kiro begins running towards them*<br>
Kiro: He's supposed to be around here some OOF!<br>
*Accidently runs into Sonic*<br>
Kiro: oh, sorry, wasn't watching where I AHHH! It's Jet! What's he doing here!? RUN!<br>
*Kiro &amp; Dansm run away*<br>
Sonic: Weird. And who's Jet?<br>
Tails: Apparently they thought it was YOU.<br>
Sonic: Weird.<br>
*Run off to try to find them*<br>
~Emerald Coast~<br>
Kiro: There he is!<br>
Dansm: Man, it's been a while scince I last saw him. He looks different.<br>
Kiro: Hey, Crimson!<br>
*Turns around to look at them*<br>
Crimson: Hey guys, What's up?<br>
Kiro: You gotta help us, Crimson! We were looking around back in the Echinos Jungle, and we got attacked by this weird monster! It got Azura, and it looked like it was after the De-chaos emeralds.<br>
Crimson: There's only one person I know who would want em'. Jet the Hedgehog.<br>
Kiro: Speaking of which, I think he's on to you, Crimson.<br>
Crimson: Why's that?<br>
Dansm: Kiro kinda had a run-in earlier.<br>
Crimson: Jet? Here?<br>
Dansm: Believe it.<br>
Crimson: Take me to where you saw im' last.<br>
Kiro: OK, but don't expect us to stick around, the last time you and Jet had a fight, you incinerated East Village in the Echinos Jungle.<br>
Crimson: Fine with me. By the way, how many didthey get? The emeralds I mean.<br>
Kiro: Just one, me and Dansm have two of em' and the other four are hidden in the jungle somewhere.<br>
Crimson: Good. Only one is still bad, but imagine if he had all seven.<br>
Kiro and Dansm: Ugh...(Worried looks on faces)<br>
Kiro: OK, we found im' around here somewhere. Look! there he is!<br>
*Run up to Sonic and Tails*<br>
Sonic: Hey, those are the same people from before!<br>
Crimson: So, found me anyway, Jet? We;;, you should've stayed home!<br>
Sonic: (Dodging punch) WOAH! What was that for?<br>
Crimson: Don't play stupid, Jet!<br>
Sonic: And who in Chaos's name is Jet!?<br>
Tails: hey, look!<br>
*Look up on top of building*<br>
Jet: Quit wasting your time with that wannabe, Crimson!<br>
Tails: He looks exactly like you!<br>
Crimson: Two Jets?<br>
Sonic: WHO IS JET!?!?!?<br>
Jet: I am, look-alike! I am the most powerful being on the planet, Jet the Hedgehog!<br>
Crimson: Yeah right, You couldn't fight your way out of a paper bag!<br>
Jet: Well, if you're so confident in yourself, Crimson, why don't you take me on here and now?<br>
Crimson: Gladly.<br>
