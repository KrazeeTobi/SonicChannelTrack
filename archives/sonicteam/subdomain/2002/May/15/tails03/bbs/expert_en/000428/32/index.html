~Beachfront~<br>
Person 1: Hey, come over here and look at this!<br>
Person 2: Wow, what is it?<br>
Person 1: I don't know, you think it's dead?<br>
Person 2: I wonder if we should help im'.<br>
Person 1 &amp; 2: Gah! It moved!<br>
*Groggily props up into sitting position*<br>
Shadow: W-w-w-where am I?<br>
Person 1 &amp; 2: Whoa, It talks!<br>
Shadow: (Standing up) Well of course I can talk! I am the ultimate life form, after all.<br>
Person 1: Who are you?<br>
Shadow: My name is Shadow, and rightnow, I need to find someone.<br>
*Runs off without any further conversation*<br>
~Back in Station Square~<br>
Jet: Well, Come and get some!<br>
Crimson: Give it up wile you still can, Jet, you know you can't win!<br>
Jet: I should say the same to you, Crimson!<br>
*Begin to fight*<br>
Crimson: (Dodging kick)Hah, you've gone soft, Jet!<br>
Jet: I don't think so! Check this!<br>
*Pulls out small device*<br>
Crimson: Whoa! What's happening?<br>
*Earthquake!*<br>
Jet: Take this!<br>
Sonic: What's going on here?<br>
Tails: Hey Sonic, does that guy over there look familiar to you?<br>
Sonic: Wuh? Jeez! It's Shadow!?<br>
Shadow: Hey, no fair starting the party without me! What the? Two Sonics?<br>
Sonic &amp; Tails: Don't ask.<br>
Jet: So, you aren't dead after all, eh? Well, take this!<br>
*Punches Shadow*<br>
Shadow: Jeez, who the heck do you think you are?<br>
Jet: I am Jet, the REAL ultimate life form, and you, Shadow, are the obsolete prototype!<br>
Shadow: What? This is too weird! And how do you know my name?<br>
Jet: Don't worry about it, you won't live long enough to find out!<br>
Shadow: I have no idea who you are, but that's not gonna happen!<br>
*Gets ready to fight*<br>
Jets's Wrist Communicator: Sir, we have located a De-chaos Emerald nearby.<br>
Jet: I'l be right there, don't let it out of your radar zone! Sorry fellas, I'll have to destroy you all later!<br>
*Runs off causing strong gust to arise.<br>
Sonic: What was that all about? And WHO IS JET!?<br>
Crimson: I can answer that. For your first question, it's a case of mistaken identity. For nuber two, Jet is an evil super hedgehog created by Dr. Ivo robotnik.<br>
Sonic: Oh, not eggman again!<br>
Crimson: So, you know who he is?<br>
Sonic: A little to well.<br>
Crimson: Anyway, as I was saying, Jet is a creation of Ivo Robotnik. I stole the plans to try and find a weakness, but so far all I found out is he was built according to the specs. of some guy named Sonic.<br>
Sonic: He was built according to me!?<br>
Crimson: Ah, so you're Sonic? That would explain why he looks like you.<br>
Sonic: Jeez, he's always coming up with some egghead plan. Come on, we may as well just go stop im' now.<br>
Crimson: Hold it, mister! He's built according to your specs., but that doesn't mean he'll be easy to beat. In case you haven't noticed, he packs a few heavy-artillery items.<br>
Tails: Ah, that guy couldn't beat Sonic if he had a high velocity pulse cannon, let alone that little earthquake thingy.<br>
Crimson: As a matter of fact, he does.<br>
Tails: .....<br>
Crimson: Weren't you wondering what was in that backpack?<br>
Tails: Oh... On second thought...<br>
Sonic: Well, what are we going to do?<br>
Crimson: I've been keeping a secret weapon in my home in the Echinos Jungle, so let's go there.<br>
Sonic: What is it?<br>
Crimson: You'll see when e get there, now everyone follow me!<br>
*All go to the Jungle*<br>
~In Jet's base~<br>
Jet: Kinidos, I'm paying you good money for this job, so don't mess it up!<br>
Kinidos: Yeah, yeah, I heard ya, get the Emerald, blah, blah, blah.<br>
Jet: If you weren't the only guy good enough to do this, I'd...<br>
Kinidos: You'd what?<br>
Jet: Just GO!<br>
*Walks out*<br>
Kinidos: That guy's such an idiot... I'm gonna get those hundred thousand bucks without lifting a finger... heh heh heh...<br>
*Pulls out large glass jewel*<br>
Kinidos: I'll just wait a convincing while, then I'll pop up with this and grab the cash.<br>
~In the Echinos Jungle~<br>
Crimson: In here!<br>
Sonic: What is it?<br>
Crimson: Hit that switch over there.<br>
*Hits switch, door opens*<br>
Crimson: Now, my secret weapon is this!<br>
*holds out large jewel*<br>
Sonic: A Chaos Emerald!?<br>
Crimson: Correction. De-chaos Emerald.<br>
Tails: De-chaos Emerald?<br>
Crimson: There's seven of em' in all, and they're just as powerful as the Chaos Emeralds.<br>
Sonic: That'll definitely help, but can we use it for Ch <br>
