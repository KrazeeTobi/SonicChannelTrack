*after cleaning the room where all the officers sleep and some chatting with the guys the<br>
   general reports them to sleep!! they all go to bed now and [ST]Shadow just got to bed<br>
   thinking*<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: Wonder what its like to be married and sleep with a girl..?<br>
<br>
   *He then dozes off in a loud snoor. He starts having a dream.*<br>
<br>
   Black Robot: So here you are my failure.<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: Huh?! hey who are you? and why does this place look old??<br>
<br>
   *He looks around and the building has stone. He looks out the stone type opening and sees men<br>
   with swords <br>
   and arrows attacking the structure.*<br>
<br>
   Black Robot: My name is Bass and it is... as you see is the medieval times.<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: Bass?! what an odd name....<br>
<br>
   Bass: Im not here to be made fun of... im here to show you what your power can be!<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: My power? My power is speed and my trusty blaster....<br>
<br>
   *goes to tap it only to find it gone.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: You dont need weapons... with your power you can stand alone without the pathetic<br>
   army...<br>
   your trait is better then any other hedgehog, human, chao, any living thing if you put your<br>
   mind to it! <br>
   you can even overpower.. hedgehog's with saiyan power lvls!<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: Saiyan's?<br>
<br>
   Bass: You will find out what they are soon.. theres a shapeshift power! It is not a form its<br>
   a magic only able to be...... used by your extreme hate! And I mean real hate burning hate a<br>
   hate you have  never felt before!<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: but ive never really hated anyone for what I know..<br>
<br>
   Bass: Yes you do... and that is the NOD side! When you unleash your power look what you can<br>
   become!!<br>
<br>
   *Bass then turns into this demon type monster which is MUCH taller then [ST]Shadow. It has<br>
   odd spikes going down its back and a long skinny neck with a medium sized head. Its arms are<br>
   skinny and long with spikes goin down it with long huge dagger looking claws on it. Its tail<br>
   lashing around with more spikes.<br>
   [ST]Shadow's eyes just get wide with fear and looks around on what to do. The monster then<br>
   talks with a hard voice.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: See!! you can be a better life form then Shadow and the NOD soldiers or ANYTHING!!<br>
<br>
   *He then transforms back and three guys appear. A NOD soldier, Shadow, and a saiyan type<br>
   hedgehog. Bass is sitting behind them with a desk. He then turns [ST]Shadow into the demon.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: This terrifying creature is called a Slayer! With it you can destroy anything!<br>
<br>
   *[ST]Shadow starts to loose his senses and wants to go beserk.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: Now it is very simple to win your battles.. but you must remember that you attack<br>
   anything that you see! Even your own team that you dont need! It can be easy like 1...<br>
<br>
   *[ST]Shadow then slashes the NOD soldier across the chest blood coming out and dies.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: 2....<br>
<br>
   *He then attacks Shadow. Shadow jumps back and looks as the Slayer just appears in front of<br>
   him and punctures him all the way through his body killing him instantly.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: 3....<br>
<br>
   *He then turns to the saiyan hedgehog who then shoots a wave of energy at him. it just<br>
   bounces off and the Slayer charges at him. the hedgehog cant move as he tries to fly upward.<br>
   The Slayer then burns him alive with an atomic flamethrower.... leaving bones.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: 4.....<br>
<br>
   *He then turns to Bass which is just smiling at him swipes off his head in one swift. He then<br>
   starts to get dizzy and his head spins.*<br>
<br>
   Bass: and 5! DONT FORGET YOU CANT BE SLAYER ALL THE TIME!!!!<br>
<br>
   *Bass then blasts him with his gun arm. killing [ST]Shadow.*<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
   *He then wakes up screaming wakeing up the other soldiers*<br>
<br>
   [ST]Shadow: WHOA! What a nightmare!<br>
