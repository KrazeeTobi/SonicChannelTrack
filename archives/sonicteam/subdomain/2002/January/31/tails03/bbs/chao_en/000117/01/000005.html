&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, this is my chao's stats:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Swim: 400<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fly: 295<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Run: 920<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Power: 295<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shouldnt it have had a second evolution by now?<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Nope! I don't know why but some chao won't evolve the second time for a long time. I have one in daycare that's only evolved once and has 999SWIM,999FLY,999RUN, 999POWER. <br>
&gt; &gt; I like it like that because he's all maxed out and has no definite look. I know from makin a blue one once before that all I need do now is give him the animal I choose until something happens. This one is black (jet) with patina green head design and floppy &quot;fins&quot; ?? &quot;Puppy dog ears&quot;?? whatever. He was all 000 when I started, he evolved the first and only time about 400+SWIM. I have had trouble with chao dying just as they get high stats no matter how hard I tried to be nice so I tried giving heart fruit ever time I went in the garden. He ended up sitting in the ring of flowers untill I maxxed him out. This meant I had to put him in a garden by himself or he'd be a serial &quot;daddy&quot; and get weak. I call him &quot;SATCHMO&quot;. That was the name of his black grandfather, a sumo in SA1. Here's the story... <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; 1. Egg from SA1, baby hatched out blue bearing name SATCHMO<br>
&gt; &gt; 2. Devoted neutral garden to raise him. I use Knuckles and Eggman to be his buddy. I get less damage from FAULTY software. (commands like punch,kick,drill etc don't even belong around daycare...grrrr..) A lot of head rubbing and fruit feeding makes chao love anybody.<br>
&gt; &gt; 3. Gave nothing but SEALS    till 999<br>
&gt; &gt; 4. Gave     &quot;       Bears    till 999<br>
&gt; &gt; 5. Gave     &quot;       Bonedogs till 999<br>
&gt; &gt; 6. Gave     &quot;       Bats     till 999<br>
&gt; &gt; 7. Gave a few bonedogs until legs came back.<br>
&gt; &gt; 8. Chao never evolved beyond normal neutral. I renamed chao &quot;sleeper&quot; and put in daycare. Won all races and beat every chao that I downloaded. Trouble was he died if I let him out of VMU or went in garden with him. I simply downloaded him from daycare and tried various things. Finally I got a time when he left two eggs. One was called &quot;sleeper&quot; when hatched. I renamed baby &quot;SATCHMO&quot; and tried to make him a grey neutral but he became a DARK. I gave SEALS AND BEARS but when he wanted to mate I was busy with something else and stuck him in school to learn trumpet.<br>
&gt; &gt; 9.I needed to put a chao in school and had to let a chao out first. I forgot about SATCHMOs &quot;condition&quot; and let him out. When I got back to neutral garden he was up on a ledge all alone except for an egg!!...and no ring of flowers.<br>
&gt; &gt; 10. THIS IS THE EGG THAT BECAME &quot;SATCHMO&quot; The chao that hatched was a jet velvety black and looked like his grampa. The old SATCHMO became DIZZY.G and this baby became my &quot;SATCHMO&quot;...back at last... back at last.<br>
&gt; &gt; 11. Repeated steps 1 through 7. Only evolved once at about 480+SWIM.  <br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks for the info....tell me, when a chao dies will it automatically leave and egg and be reborn if it was treated right?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
In my experience when they cocoon and then fade to nothing, if you just stand there.. they are gone. If I have one I really like I keep an update of it in daycare. I have tried other ways also...<br>
1. Shut off Dreamcast... reload.<br>
   a. he may be sleeping and you can pick him up and put in VMU.<br>
   b. he may be in cocoon but visible... you can run in and race him at the track if your in neutral garden... if he's anygood, leave race, RUSH through garden, go to daycare on the net and save for further modification / or not.<br>
   c. you may find an egg (name gone, probably not any relationship)<br>
   d. you may find two eggs, usually one has your chao's name.<br>
   e. you may get a reset garden with two fresh eggs and no chao, trees, toys etc.   <br>
<br>
I usually play it safe and leave the garden as soon as I suspect he's dying then post him on the daycare. YES! HE WILL SHOW AS LIVE CHAO IN DAYCARE. he will be on a &quot;hair trigger&quot; to die and must be treated VERY SPECIAL when dowloaded.
