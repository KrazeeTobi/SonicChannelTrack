&gt; how many thinks that sega is dead? a bunch i bet huh? well what if Sega is doing something smart with their investments? now im not saying that it is happening but what if sega is playing possum, you know lying low for a time being.what if they do come up with something that might open a whole new door in gaming? you got to look at how many doors they opened up for gaming? like the first 16-bit system, &amp; the first 8-bit back-lit hand held system, we cant forget about the first 16-bit hand held system No-mad, then the 32-bit sega saturn,also the very first 128-bit system &quot;Sega Dreamcast.&quot; sure they rush lots of stuff i admitt &amp; could have spent more time on some system *sega saturn cough* but they did lots of quality made games some better then others right? of course. &amp; yes they could still use some work in keeping up with stuff like the sonic adventure web-sites &amp; others they have for other game too. but you see sega made a mark in gaming history. &amp; as for the ever popular gaming system Playstation dont get me wrong but that idea was stolen from nintendo. how you may ask? well you see the thing that we know as PSX was a up-grade for the nintendo 64 sony was supose to  help with it but after working on the up-grade the was too many bugs in the development that it wouldnt work for the 64 witch was going to be named the ultra 64, but change it because it wasn't &quot;too Kiddy friendly&quot; so they changed it to N64. but anyways the up-grade was bought from nintendo &amp; made into a console of its own. that was kinda off subject. but people seem to for get what else makes sega what it is. it is their mascot sonic the hedgehog. sonic made history along with sega. so even if you dont like sega you got to realize that if it wasnt for sega i think it would have taken alittle longer to get where we are now. please put in-put in on this thought other people &amp; myself would like to know what you think.<br>

Since it came out I played and still play SA1. I still have archived chao that old email friends occasionally request and I post in daycare. Since its inception I have posted many msgs. and Chao at this  site in SA2 BBS and daycare. I had email friends around the globe in SA1... I have yet to have an email from an SA2 fan. Just BS on the BBS from talking heads, hackers, self styled gurus, cliques and chao editor cheaters. <br>
Sega is not dead the Dreamcast is dead.<br>
Sega is not playing possum... some of its fans are playing stupid...!!!<br>
