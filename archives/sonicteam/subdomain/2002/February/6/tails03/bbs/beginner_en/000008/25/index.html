People should be able to transform into Super Sonic and Hyper Shadow, as well as Super Tails, Hyper Knuckles, Hyper Rouge and wel...Super Eegman(Super Robotnik) as long as they have 50 coins like before(of course you know the old can't transform if shielded rule). It totally sucks that you can only use Sonic and Shadow only at the end, Tails should at least walk sometimes(Eegman, can't imagine him going through a stage without his Eegwalker)there should also be Super other Characters like Big The Cat and Amy and of course E 102(FROM SA 1). They all should be Super People(Makes Sense or else it's no fun, all that work for so little or not much, it sucks. And plus Kart Racing should be more like Mario Kart 64 not like some Disney Game. People not only streets but also temples, ice plces, beaches, caves, space, every where you can think of and where the game goes(areas all over the place, hills, grass, ice, etc, course all over the place(the earth it self, even space and the space statin, and light speed dashing in loops in kart and regular modes(1P AND MULTIPLAYER). And plus DRIVING should also be like Mario Kart 64. PEOPLE LOVE THAT MARIO GAME SO SHOULD SHOULD MAKE SONIC RACING(I MEAN THE KART RACING IN THE SA2 GAME). Make it Exactly like Mario Kart 64(no difference) something like that. EXACTLY LIKE IT, MAKE IT ATTRACK MORE PEOPLE. There also should be more Racing tracks. Like every track in the game should be available in VS MODE. Do you know fast people get bored in 2P VS MODE)ALSO MAKE IT 4 PLAYERS, FOR EXAMPLE: After you complete all missions for a Character, in VS MODE, you get to pick another verson of that character. so now there are 4 HEDGEHOGS TO CHOOSE FROM, FOR EXAMPLE: 1P AND 3RD ARE HERO AND 2ND AND 4TH ARE DARKSIDE. 1P: EITHER SONIC 2P: EITHER SHADOW 3P: EITHER SONIC 4P: EITHER SHADOW.<br>
Oh and there should be weapons in Kart racing(just like MARIO KART 64(HIT BOXES TO GET ITEMS, AND IT SHOULD BE LIKE ROULETTE(PRESS A BUTTON TO MAKE IT STOP SPINNING)) And weapons in 1P MODE(OR MAYBE I'M GOING OVER BOARD HERE) AND DEFFINETLY IN 2P MODE TO CAUSE MORE ACTION AND FUN AND BE MORE XTREME. XTREME AS XTREME 3(SKATE BAORDNG GAME) JUST AS XTREME AS A SKATE BOARDING GAME, SKI AND SKATE BOARD MODE, ALSO TRANSFORM INTO SUPER WHOM EVER YOU ARE(EACH SUPER CHARACTER SHOULD HAVE HIS OWN SPECIAL ABILITIES LIKE IN SONIC AND KNUCKLES(FOR SEGA GENESIS)(SONIC HAS THE FLASH, TAILS HAS ANIMALS TO KILL ENEMIES AND KNUCKLES HAS THE POWER TO SHAKE WALLS AND GLIDE FASTER, SOMETHING LIKE THAT)) AT ALL TIMES IN ALL MODES, EVEN KART RACING, AS LONG AND YOU HAVE 50 COINS(MY BAD ABOUT THE CAPS, JUST SHOWING YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS OR ELSE PEOPLE WILL GET BORED OF THE GAME FAST) You should do something different to transform to super form in Kart racing. And plus you should be able to play some old sonic(FOR GENESIS AND OTHER SYSTEMS) stages SA2 STYLE(IN 3D). And also some people think Kart racing the way it is now, totally sucks and is for little kids, so change this to some i said earliar, migt work. And the cpu drives reclessly(they would get Arrested for reckless driving) so also change that to the MARIO KART 64 STYLE(drive stight, not all over the road) AND ALSO HOW YOU DRIVE(THE CONTROLLS). PLEASE DO THIS, IT WILL MAKE THE GAME MORE EXCITING, FUN, XTREME AND BETTER AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROLL YOUR CHAO DURING CHAO RACES. 14. So all these changes should be downloadable from the site or something, just do something, the game will be more improved and there should be more courses for characters and more chao gardens(more dark and light(hero) gardens). Shadow is missing a cousres and you said each charater has 5 courses but instead once agin gave sonic more staged than anyone else. Give Shadow another course(or maybe the green hills zone could be for Shadow, just give him his course. Thanx<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: i may have more ideas in the future and multiplayer(4 PLAYERS) in Kart racing(SONIC KART RACING)CHAO ALSO DRIVE IN KARTS FOR WHOLE RACE, AND OTHERS, THEY GET IN AND OUT DURING RACE, make there racing more like the races in other mode, battle mode in kart racing like mario kart with big or gigantic arenas, battle w/ tails and eegman, bigger arenas and all here stages, rouge, knucles, look for more pieces of the master emerald and other stuff, bigger are gigantic arenas. AND WEAPONS IN ALL MODES AND MORE MOVES TOO(EXAMPLE: CHAOS CONTROL, MAKE MORE MOVES TO USE, FOR EVERY CHARACTER. amy should battle with big and E 102 SHOULD BATTLE WITH E 103, SAME AS ABOVE. There maybe more ideas. SO DO ALL OF THIS AND SA2 WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN OR NEVER PLAYED AGAIN AFTER A YEAR OF SO. ALL THIS SHOULD  BE DOWNLOADED FROM SITE or something. AND DO THE SUPER CHACTERS AND THERE OWN SPECIAL ABILITIES AND TAILS AND EEGMAN SHOULD GET OUT OF THERE MACHINES SOMETIMES. AND OF COURSE MUCH BIGGER OR GIGANTIC CHAO GARDENS(MAYBE A CHAO CITY, HE HE)MORE CHAO GARDENS LIKE I SAID BEFORE. THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS: DARK GARDENS SHOULD BE LONGER PATH AND BIG AND SCARIER AND LIGHT(HERO)SHOULD HAVE MORE LIGHT LONGER PATHES(SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT BIGGER AND MOR GIGANTIC)(OK, NOW I AM DEFFINETLY GOING OVER BOARD ON THIS NOW, MY BAD)SAME FOR ALL COURSES(LONGER COUSRES(I CAN'T SEEM TO STOP MYSELF, AND MAKE IT MORE LIKE YOUR DREAMING OR NIGHTMERE FROM HELL)SAME GOES FOR ALL TRACKS IN THE GAME(THESE ARE ALL SUGGESTIONS)(AND PLAYERS(UP TO FOUR) WITH ALL CHARATERS BATTLE EACH OTHER)Thanx<br>
