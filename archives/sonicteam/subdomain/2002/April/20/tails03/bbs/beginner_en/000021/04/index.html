(Smell that?  These are fresh from today!)<br>
<br>
1.  Outside camera angle/Big the Cat<br>
<br>
      Float up with the air current.  Turn around and climb up to the platform with the two wooden boxes.  Climb up as far as you can above the platform, and move a bit to the right.  You should see Big above you hanging on for his dear life.  Go left a bit till you are in the middle of a darker area of rock, then you can go up a bit more.  Rotate the camera to the right using the R Trigger.  The camera will go right through the wall!  You will get a view of the outside.  You can see the other side of Big.  But it doesnt end here!  You can dig and see Knuckles go through the other side of the wall!  You may have though that the items actually appeared on the other side of the walls, but now you know better.  You will notice that pressing right will make you go left and vice versa.  Go all the way to the right by climbing.  If you let go the camera will go back around to your side.  You will notice that some objects go through the wall, including one side of a chao box.  Go back to where Big is.  Go down without hitting or landing on any ledges(this is easy to do, you can see the objects clearly to avoid.  When you are almost to the bottom, you can see the inside of the bottom floor of the level, the roof is removed and you can see the rocks floating.<br>
<br>
2.  Play to a wall<br>
<br>
      Go to the ledge at the top of the bottom level.  Go to the corner with the metal boxes.  Bust through and <br>
climb through to the other side.  Climb on the right side of the ruins door.  Rotate the camera to the right again.  You will see the Mystic Ruins object on the other side.  Jump down.  Stand next to the wall and you will notice you can play through the wall and activate the other mystic ruin without even opening the door!  This could save time in certain situations.<br>
<br>
DC:  Making the rational irrational to your advantage.  Enjoy.<br>

This is really cool... as I went to the right(push left) and up and down exploring the wall on the back side and digging through now and again an explosive shell burst through. It knocked out chunks that fell into....??? I was able to push right(left) until I had passed the end and continued without seeing, but sensing him moving along the other wall. Now when you push left he keeps on left. I finally popped out on a small shelf and the heavy guns (2) were flying close by, I dug a hole and got a bomb that knocked out both Sky Hawks. I was able to find the bomb without going outside. It's above the moving weight and into the wall, about the middle of the left red post you will see a darker patch of rocks, an indent, out of danger.<br>
 <br>
*Whoops! It's not always in the same place, but it is above weight and between top of left &amp; right post. If its to the right post it will not take out the far Sky H. That whole wall spot is rich in rings &amp; stuff.* <br>
<br>
 I theorized there must be another for the enemys down the opposite alley. YUP! found it! Go to and face lonesome statue, climb left wall and come back toward red beam with condor, dig just below beam and before you reach it... voila! And you know of the bomb in the middle quiet zone.<br>
Hey! Thanks! I really like exploring... it reveals the twisted mind of ST.<br>
<br>
Hey! I went all the way around to the shelf on the other side with the two coin containers and a purple trunk. ON THE OUTSIDE! It also gives clues where the jewels are....
