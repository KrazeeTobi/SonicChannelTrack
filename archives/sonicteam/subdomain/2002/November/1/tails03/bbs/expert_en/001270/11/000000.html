It pains me so to have to write these words, to tell my tale. Yet, I must find a way to get the thoughts, the memories of my encounters with my double, out of my head. I can only hope with all my soul that telling someone will stop the horrible dreams and reminiscing. Within these pages I fill with the memories of my encounters with my doppelganger. After my first encounter with this evil demon, I began carrying a handgun with me, just to feel safe. Of course, I knew that this would never help me if I ran into it again, but it did give me a sense of security. My double haunted my dreams, thoughts, and speech. I was denied the privilege of a dreamless sleep many times, so eventually this forced me back to the mansion where I discovered my demon. As I neared the gates, I paused and looked up at the mansion. It was fairly large, with a large tower jutting out from the middle of the building. I often longed to enter the mansion, and on this day I succumbed to this urge. Boldly I thrust open the main doors, staring down the dusty hallway. I paused, thinking about how this reminded me of a dream I had. Disregarding this, I moved further in, the doors slamming behind me. This was definitely not going to turn out well...<br>
<br>
Sighing, I began to walk further down the hall, my eyes passing across the many, many paintings that hung upon the wall. Paintings of people, of landscapes, of houses. I stopped to admire many a painting, until I found that I had walked quite far into the mansion. I shrugged it off, stopping to admire another painting. I felt something pass behind me, and I whirled around, drawing my gun and firing a shot at what I saw. Unfortunatly for me, I had just shot at a mirror. Not a smart thing to do. The sound of shattering glass filled the hall and I barely managed to shield my eyes in time as I was bombarded with broken glass. I winced as some of it pierced the skin on my arms. I spent the next painful half hour digging shards of glass out of my arms, and another half hour trying to figure out why I had been so stupid and what I felt pass behind me. Once I finished this, I continued on my way, knowing that I was beind watched and followed but not really caring.<br>
<br>
What caused my unnecassary braveness, I doubt I'll ever know. With that braveness came great stupidity. Such stupidity that at one point I turned around and actually confronted the doppelganger, who had indeed been following me. Of course, had I know that I would have been knocked unconscious and chained to a wall again, I wouldn't have done that. In fact, I wouldn't have gone in the mansion at all. I sighed as I awoke, hanging on the wall again, I noticed my gun was gone. Wow, not only is it a violent evil demon, it's a SMART evil demon. How lucky am I? Now the only thing for me to do was watch and wait. Hanging in the darkness, I began to hear something. Something that sounded like dripping. The kind of annoying dripping you hear when you've got a leaky faucet. As my eyes began to adjust to the darkness, the room began to get brighter, and also I began hearing a small splashing sound accompanying the dripping. Eventually the room was bright enough for me to see normally, and I scanned the room. I froze when I found what had been causing the dripping noise, and screamed at the top of my lungs soon after. For across from me in the room hung a body, drenched in it's own blood, hideous wounds covering it, blood dripping off it and down into a little puddle on the floor. If I thought about anything at this point, it was if I was going to suffer the same fate as my cellmate.<br>
<br>
I spent the next few hours crying out of fear, sometimes screaming in frustration. My wrists ached from the continuous strain put on them by the chains, and I was getting sick from looking at, or rather, not looking at, the corpse than hung across from me. After what seemed like an eternity more, I watched my double glide into the room and over to me, staring into my eyes. It has got to be the scariest thing to do, to look into your own eyes. I began to feel an eerie cold penetrate my every <br>
