&gt;I began to feel an eerie cold penetrate my every pore, infect my mind, steal my voice away. It was all I could do to fight it, to keep looking into the dark eyes of the doppelganger, to show that I wasn't scared, that I wouldn't give in. Eventually it turned and moved across the room, and I suddenly dropped to the floor, the chains around my wrists gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;W-wha...?&quot;<br>
<br>
It smirked and said, &quot;Go. Get out. That is, if you can. You have exactly one hour to find a way out of here...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And if I don't?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You get to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wonderful, I thought, as I darted out of the room. I had an hour to wait to die. I ran the halls of that mansion floor by floor, until I swear I could have told you which floorboards squeaked and how many nails there were. I finally had but one door left, and barely a few minutes left to live. I threw it open and ran up the flight of stairs, emerging on the roof. I ran to the edge, then it sunk in where I was. I had made it out. I would live!! ...or not. Suddenly I felt that cold feeling again, and I was enveloped in a cylinder of gray color. I don't know how, but I knew this was what spawned my doppelganger. The Shadows. As I stood there, all my worst memories played through my head, all my mistakes. And I thought of how much I had complained about my life...my faults, my mistakes. And I realized, it was because of this, that I was forced to live a life of fear and suffering with a ghostly double. I screamed in frustration and sorrow, shattering the Shadows that had encircled me, leaping from the roof, deaf to the screams of my doppelganger, who was behind me. How I survived that fall I shan't ever know. All I know is that I ran, and ran, and ran. When I finally stopped, I collapsed in the grass, breathing hard. Alas, this is not the end of my story....<br>
