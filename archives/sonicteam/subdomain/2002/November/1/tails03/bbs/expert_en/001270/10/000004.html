&gt; I shiver as I write the words that you are reading, for I am about to tell about an experience I shall never forget. Many stories about the supernatural have been told, but this one is not fiction, it is truth. It began on a warm summer night, and I was out for my daily walk. I was passing an old mansion that I usually stop and look at often, when I suddenly felt drawn towards it. I couldn't control my body as I walked up to the front door and somehow managed to get in. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I must have roamed the halls for at least an hour before I stopped in a dusty hall to rest. I had the strangest inner feeling of being followed, and every time I got this feeling, I was struck with a sense of being cold. I walked slowly on towards the end of the hallway, the cold feeling getting stronger, until I starting shivering. I thought I heard a sound of breathing that mimicked my own, and when I turned a corner, I found out why. I opened my mouth to scream, but I couldn't. I was staring right into the eyes of an exact copy of myself, although it was translucent and ghostly. I tried to speak, but could only squeak. I watched an evil smile curl up on the lips of my doppelganger, and I instinctively turned to run, only to be confronted by it again. I whirled around and ran down the hall, trying to escape from whatever fate may have been waiting for me. Unfortunately for me, I tripped on a loose floorboard, and fell. I am not sure what happened, but I think I may have passed out, for all I could see was black.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I awoke within some room, though it's size was indistinguishable in the total darkness. I tried to move my arms and legs, but found that I could not, for I was chained aganist a wall by my wrists and ankles. Sighing, I began fearing the worst. I looked forward again, this time to see my ghostly double approaching me slowly, a dagger in its hand. At last the doppelganger stood in front of me, and I looked into it's eyes, my eyes. The eyes were fathomless, and I was jerked back to reality when I felt the dagger being pushed into my side. Whimpering, I struggled aganist the chains, only to have the dagger pushed hilt-deep into my side, causing me to let out a frightening scream. It laughed cruelly, starting to twist the dagger around. My mind fixated itself upon a single thought, and that was Why is this happening to me? What did I do? Alas, I did not have time to think about this. I yelped when the dagger was removed from my side, shuddering as blood poured from the wound. I gasped for breath shakily, my soul and mind being permeated by the frigid cold. I looked down at the wound, watching the doppelganger move a hand so that it was next to it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;W-what are you d-doing?&quot; was all I could ask. I looked back into its eyes momentarily, and it only laughed cruelly. I looked back to its hand, and watched a pale blue liquid emit from the tip of one of its fingers. The strange, ghostly liquid coated the wound entirely as I looked back up to my doppelganger. It smirked at me before disappearing. I had only to wait a mere few moments before I found out what the liquid was. I let loose screaming at the top of my lungs in sheer pain. This is pain that is indescribable with words, and one would have to experience it to believe it, though I cannot see why you'd want to. I don't know how long I hung there screaming, and even longer I spent crying. Surely my life was coming to an end. My mind roamed fields of memories, which only caused me to cry harder. I shut my eyes, trying to think of what caused this to happen. In my mind's eye, all my bad memories and experiences flooded back, haunting me. This went on for presumably many hours, until I was on the verge of insanity. Then it came back. My doppelganger entered the room and walked over to me. To my surprise, it began unchaining me. Finally, it spoke to me, saying, &quot;I believe you've suffered enough...for now. Trust me ...we'll meet again.&quot; And with that, I passed out.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I awoke outside the mansion lying in the grass, and I weakly stood up. Clutching my wounded side, I trudged off to find someone to treat my wound. It's words haunted me, and they were truth, for we indeed did meet again. But that, is another story...<br>
