<TEXTAREA NAME="Text" COLS="60" ROWS="6" WRAP="VIRTUAL">Questions are marked with a Q,
If it's True,it's marked with a T,
If it's False,it's marked with an F.

Q  Is it true that E-102  ( the robotic Robotnik )  is in the game?
T!  Everybody says he's not in it,but if you beat all of Rouge's missions,
you can be E-102 in the Kart Races.  ( Rouge's alternate &quot;kart&quot; )

Q  Is it true that you can see &quot;a little more&quot; of Rouge in this game?
AMAZINGLY T!!
Actually,you can see about 70% of her body!
This is another one that everyone denies because the game is
&quot;E&quot; rated.  ( for everyone )  I don't think ESRB is gonna unlock
everything in the game to find out,and even if I'm wrong...
These days...Nobody really cares!  It would be strange if she was
&quot;Anatomically Incorrect&quot;!  So shut up and...
Get all &quot;A&quot; ranks with Rouge. 
She'll have an alternate costume in multiplayer!

Q  Is it true that there's a &quot;LAST&quot; story in the game?
?  Why don't you BEAT the Hero and Dark stories,
and FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!!
I don't care how much you insist there's a Game Over screen!
If you haven't found it after the amount of times you've died,
it OBVIOUSLY isn't there!!

Q  Is it true that Mario makes an appearance in SA2B to
show that Sega and Sonic Team are no longer enemies of Nintendo?
F  Uhh...no.  Mario isn't in this.
I think it's a rule that Company mascots DON'T
appear on other companies' games or something.

Q  I found a bunch of sites that tell me where to see BIG the cat...
But I can't find him!  I even triple checked the locations!
Is he really in the game?
?  Umm...
Some people say he was taken out of SA2 when the B was added.
Other people say that there are 2 versions of SA2B...I donno.

Q  Is Tails a guy or a girl?

I honestly don't know.
I'll post pics of tails on the site I'm gonna make.
Pics that have a girly looking Tails,and pics with Normal Tails.
I can't just go by the old show,either!
Some things just change on TV...
Sometimes even just different series will have a different few people
and stuff like that!  An example is...
In the game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;,the character &quot;Roy&quot;
has RED HAIR...But in the anime called &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;,
( which is where Roy and Marth came from )
Roy has GREEN HAIR!!  So even though Tails is a guy in the show...
I think...I can't just say he's a guy in the game,too...
I think he's a guy,though...He doesn't act like a girl,and if he was...
Amy Rose wouldn't stand a chance!

Well,that's all for now...
Oh...yah...EGGMAN and ROBOTNIK are NOT the same person!
( also,I think that's spelled with a C before the K...maybe...)

DO NOT give me negative answers on this stuff
unless you KNOW that something I said is wrong.
Any other negative responses will be ignored!</TEXTAREA></TD>
