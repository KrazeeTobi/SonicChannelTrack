           &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;<br>
<br>
[Eminem]<br>
May I have your attention please?<br>
May I have your attention please?<br>
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<br>
We're gonna have a problem here..<br>
<br>
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before<br>
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door<br>
and started whoopin her ass worse than before<br>
they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture (Ahh!)<br>
It's the return of the... &quot;Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, <br>
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?&quot;<br>
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots! <br>
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)<br>
Feminist women love Eminem<br>
[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*] <br>
&quot;Slim Shady, I'm sick of him<br>
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what<br>
Flippin the you-know-who,&quot; &quot;Yeah, but he's so cute though!&quot;<br>
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<br>
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms<br>
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't<br>
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<br>
&quot;My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips&quot;<br>
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss<br>
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids<br>
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<br>
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is<br>
By the time they hit fourth grade<br>
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?<br>
&quot;We ain't nothing but mammals..&quot; Well, some of us cannibals<br>
who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*SLURP*]<br>
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<br>
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<br>
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote<br>
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)]<br>
<br>
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady<br>
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating<br>
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,<br>
please stand up, please stand up?<br>
<br>
[Eminem]<br>
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;<br>
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!<br>
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?<br>
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me<br>
&quot;But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?&quot;<br>
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?<br>
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?<br>
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs<br>
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst<br>
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first<br>
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV<br>
&quot;Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!&quot;<br>
I should download her audio on MP3 <br>
and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [*AHHH!*]<br>
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me<br>
so I have been sent here to destroy you [*bzzzt*]<br>
And there's a million of us just like me<br>
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me<br>
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me<br>
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
[Eminem]<br>
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you <br>
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room<br>
The only difference is I got the balls to say it<br>
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all<br>
I just get on the mic and spit it <br>
and whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it<br>
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can<br>
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums<br>
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty<br>
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting<br>
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens<br>
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working<br>
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin<br>
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings<br>
[*HACH*] Or in the parkin lot, circling<br>
Screaming &quot;I don't give a fuck!&quot; <br>
with his windows down and his system up<br>
So, will the real Shady please stand up?<br>
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?<br>
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control<br>
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2X]<br>
<br>
[Eminem]<br>
Ha ha<br>
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us<br>
Fuck it, let's all stand up<br>
<br>
<br>
