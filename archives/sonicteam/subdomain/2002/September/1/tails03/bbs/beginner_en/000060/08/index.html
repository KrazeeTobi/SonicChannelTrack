[Life]<br>
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini<br>
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie<br>
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B.<br>
'cause this one's for your radios or whether you recieve me<br>
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti<br>
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me<br>
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier<br>
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya<br>
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger<br>
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour<br>
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls,<br>
we've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol<br>
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero<br>
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow<br>
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so<br>
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo<br>
<br>
[2-D]<br>
It's a hard dream to contemplate<br>
I could fall into the abyss-ah<br>
And I love this interlude<br>
It's the reason to deliver<br>
And they called onto me<br>
Says they came to talk to me though<br>
The more of us that lies,<br>
I guess the kids don't live or die<br>
<br>
[Si Phili]<br>
'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it<br>
so people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it<br>
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy<br>
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi<br>
We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound<br>
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground<br>
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force<br>
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course<br>
'cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing<br>
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling<br>
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol<br>
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than crystal<br>
The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin',<br>
makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen<br>
to rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor<br>
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for<br>
<br>
[2-D]<br>
It's a hard dream to contemplate<br>
I could fall into the abyss-ah<br>
And I love this interlude<br>
It's the reason to deliver<br>

The more of us that lies,<br>
I guess the kids don't live or die<br>

Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star,<br>
whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car<br>
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far,<br>
you'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire<br>
See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs<br>
'cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars<br>
We rap stars with supernatural spars<br>
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours<br>
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down<br>
'cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round<br>
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground<br>
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound<br>
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps<br>
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat<br>
It's like that when we write raps<br>
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!<br>
