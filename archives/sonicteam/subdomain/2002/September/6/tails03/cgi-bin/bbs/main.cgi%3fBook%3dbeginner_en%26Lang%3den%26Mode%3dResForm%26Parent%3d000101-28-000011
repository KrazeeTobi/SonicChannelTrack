&gt;            &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; [Eminem]
&gt; May I have your attention please?
&gt; May I have your attention please?
&gt; Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
&gt; I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
&gt; We're gonna have a problem here..
&gt; 
&gt; Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
&gt; Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
&gt; and started whoopin her ass worse than before
&gt; they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture (Ahh!)
&gt; It's the return of the... &quot;Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, 
&gt; he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?&quot;
&gt; And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots! 
&gt; Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
&gt; Feminist women love Eminem
&gt; [*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*] 
&gt; &quot;Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
&gt; Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
&gt; Flippin the you-know-who,&quot; &quot;Yeah, but he's so cute though!&quot;
&gt; Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
&gt; But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
&gt; Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
&gt; but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
&gt; &quot;My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips&quot;
&gt; And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
&gt; And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
&gt; And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
&gt; Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
&gt; By the time they hit fourth grade
&gt; They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
&gt; &quot;We ain't nothing but mammals..&quot; Well, some of us cannibals
&gt; who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*SLURP*]
&gt; But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
&gt; then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
&gt; [*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
&gt; Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes
&gt; 
&gt; [Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)]
&gt; 
&gt; I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
&gt; All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
&gt; So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
&gt; please stand up, please stand up?
&gt; 
&gt; [Eminem]
&gt; Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
&gt; well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
&gt; You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
&gt; Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
&gt; &quot;But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?&quot;
&gt; Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
&gt; So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
&gt; Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
&gt; so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
&gt; and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
&gt; You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
&gt; &quot;Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!&quot;
&gt; I should download her audio on MP3 
&gt; and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [*AHHH!*]
&gt; I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
&gt; so I have been sent here to destroy you [*bzzzt*]
&gt; And there's a million of us just like me
&gt; who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
&gt; who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
&gt; and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!
&gt; 
&gt; [Chorus]
&gt; 
&gt; [Eminem]
&gt; I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you 
&gt; things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
&gt; The only difference is I got the balls to say it
&gt; in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
&gt; I just get on the mic and spit it 
&gt; and whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it
&gt; better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
&gt; Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
&gt; It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
&gt; I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
&gt; Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens
&gt; And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
&gt; And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
&gt; He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings
&gt; [*HACH*] Or in the parkin lot, circling
&gt; Screaming &quot;I don't give a fuck!&quot; 
&gt; with his windows down and his system up
&gt; So, will the real Shady please stand up?
&gt; And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
&gt; And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
&gt; and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
&gt; 
&gt; [Chorus 2X]
&gt; 
&gt; [Eminem]
&gt; Ha ha
&gt; Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
&gt; Fuck it, let's all stand up
&gt; 
&gt;
