&gt; Mononoke: Do you think I enjoy being a forest god?  Well, I do sometimes, but this is how I became a forest god in the first place...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; My story begins long ago, I have almost forgotten how fast the years have gone by me. This was a age before humans, where the packs of wolves roamed without restraint or care. I was a wolf with a pelt the color of ebony.  My mother and father had only bared me, so I had no siblings to play with. But I had a pack, a family, a life...it was a simple but I was happy. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Things never changed. We hunted, we howled at the moon, we raced through the forests. My pack and I were one and I loved every one of them. The pain of losing my parents to old age was even deadened by their love for me. That is until I saw him. He was the new leader of the pack, young and beautiful. He was as bright as the sun, his fur as well as his charm. I grew fond of him, all the girls did. I was young, naive, stupid to give my heart away. I found out that I was just another pretty face to him, nothing more...and it broke my heart. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I ran away, crying my pain to the forest. That's when I was caught off guard and captured by cold-hearted creatures, humans I later found out, with dark intentions for me. I tried to tear my way out of the net they held me in but it wouldn’t give so I howled and cried to be spared. As I was bond, fearing the worse, my heart grew lighter as I saw my pack come for me, my beloved leader at the head of them. I would be saved by these wicked things! Or so I thought. I watched as that handsome face turned and with it, the pack vanished back into darkness. I was betrayed instead. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; *shutters inwardly* <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I will not talk about that part of my life, it is better forgotten. I will say that when I managed to escape, I was vengeful. If my pack would forget me so easily, then I would feel no pity toward them or any other wolf. Humans had come more and more into our woods, some of them hunted other creatures. I led these hunters as they called themselves, into the depths of the forest where they could set their traps for my kind. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The howls of the ones I betrayed will always remain with me. Two packs of wolves I betrayed and still I led the hunters on. There was one pack I wanted to see thrown down, only one....my pack. The hunt drove me a little mad but I found them one quiet evening as the sky was turning gray. I watched in bitter delight as the humans caught every single member of my long ago family, even the handsome leader fell before their traps. My pack was the last of three I would ever betray again. Unknowing to me, the forest gods that watched over the wolf packs grew angry with my deeds. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I will remember that day until the earth is nothing but a dried shell and I am the last to survive its doom. I would be condemned for my actions, they told me. Half-heartily, I begged to be forgiven but the forest gods.  But they knew I didn't believe my own words.  And so it was beyond forgiveness for them. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They circled me until I felt light-headed from the swirl of light. For the last time in true flesh, I cried in sorrow for only now did I know what my punishment would be. My coat was changed to start things off. It was striped of its black and blossomed into white, with black only on my chest. I was granted immortality. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I have watched the world pass me by. Seen friends grow old and die before my eyes. The seasons change while I remain untouched, doomed to wander the world alone... <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The end. Were you expecting a happy ending? <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; *smiles bitterly* <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sorry, happiness died a long time ago with my hope of ever being released from this curse. The only thing that grants me peace is to know that my pack paid. That I will never regret doing.... <br>
