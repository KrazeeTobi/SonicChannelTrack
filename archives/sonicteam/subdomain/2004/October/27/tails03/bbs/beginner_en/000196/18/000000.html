I promise I'll finish it!  I love Balto.  I'm a little immature that way. (stupid kid movies... they suck you in and steal your mind...) well, the other day I saw a movie called Balto II: Wolf Quest.  I'm gonna write a story about it.  Here goes...<br>
Wolf Quest: part one<br>
<br>
Balto was running across the ice.  He was aparently chasing a raven.  He got closer to it... closer... closer..... suddenly, a huge wall of ice broke out of the ground.  Balto couldn't run any farther with that wall in the way!  All of a sudden, the ice underneath his feet started to crack, revealing ice cold water underneath.  The raven turned and faced Balto.  It started to fly towared him with blinding speed.  Balto quickly turned and ran away from it, jumping from ice berg to ice berg.  On a large ice berg ahead of him, Balto saw a pack of wolves.  Their yellow eyes sparkled.  Balto thought that they might be dangerous, but the raven chasing him was probably dangerous too.  He heard his name being called.  &quot;Baaaaallltooooo.... Balllltoooooooooo..... BALTO!&quot;  Suddenly, Balto found himself covered with cold water.  His best friend, Boris the goose, had dumped it on him.  Balto lived with Boris on an old ship that had somehow gotten up on shore.  &quot;Huh?!&quot;  He said.  &quot;What happened?!  What's the matter?!&quot;  &quot;The matter is,&quot; replied Boris. &quot;You vere havink dream again.  Dis dream is keeping you from a good night's sleep, and if your eyes get any droopier, you're gonna hafta hold dem open vith toothpicks!&quot;  Balto shook off the water.  &quot;Boris,&quot; he said.  &quot;The only thing keeping me from a good night's sleep is you waking me up.&quot;  &quot;I'm tellin' ya, Balto&quot; replied Boris.  &quot;If ya keep having the same dream over and over again, it MEANS sometink!&quot;  &quot;Dream don't mean anything.&quot; replied Balto, rather annoyed.  &quot;They're just-&quot; he yawned. &quot;dreams.  I'm gonna go check on Jenna.  You comin'?&quot; he asked as he got up.  &quot;Of course I'm comink!&quot; shouted Boris. &quot;I'm not finished nagging you yet!&quot; They walked over to Jenna's house...<br>
