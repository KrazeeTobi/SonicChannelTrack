There were 4 chaos,peaches,storm,blood,and evil.Peaches and storm were heroes,while blood and evil were dark.One day,blood fell in the lake.Peaches saw the accident, then he told the other two what he saw.But evil asked&quot;Why should we help him?&quot; Peaches protested,&quot;But,but...&quot;  &quot;Yeah!&quot; Storm said.Why should we help blood? He hogs all of the food anyway! &quot;Because,because...fine! I will help him by myself!&quot;peaches declared. He ran too the lake and said,&quot;Grab my paw!&quot; Then with all his might, he pulled blood out! &quot;Wow you saved my life!&quot;Blood said. And they all lived happily ever after. The End.

Once there was a little pink dark chao that nobody wanted.  The chao wasn't sure why.  He had good stats.  He was a flying type chao with no feet and a mohawk like a peacock.  He had condor wings.  He hadn't eaten in days.  He barely had enough energy to fly.  So he fainted.  When he woke up, a silver echidna (me) was looking at him.  &quot;Hi!&quot;  I said.  &quot;I'm Spyke.&quot;  The chao didn't have a name, and he told me that.  I told him I would take care of him, and I named him Flip.  The end.
