     &quot;We can't return this piece of souped-up crap to Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff because some wild-eyed maniac ripped the receipt clean out of my hands as we were walkin' out to the lot and ran into the McLardy's across the street. Then, right as I'm about to reclaim what is rightfully mine, some brilliant misbegotten insect goes and eradicates the receipt with a shotgun!!&quot;<br>
   Llama burst out of the remains of a nearby fire hydrant.<br>
   &quot;RECEIPT!?!?!?!?!&quot; he shouted, grabbing a bit of broken streetlight and feverishly beating it against his shoe, &quot;WOOKIE WOOKIE WOOKIE!!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Gracious,&quot; sighed Quack, emerging from a desecrated mailbox with a fish, &quot;Of all the lousy... A dumpster? Look, if you were going to crash, you could've at least hit another car, or a wall or something decent. But no. What do you hit? A dumpster.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I swear,&quot; complained Swazi, pushing the building debris off his carcass and picking the glass out of his teeth, &quot;that dumpster just sort of jumped out in front of me. I didn't see it coming at all!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Treeburt saw it coming,&quot; proclaimed Rocklobster, dislodging himself from a brick wall, still clutching the burnt orange suitcase, &quot;He sees everything.&quot; Swazi gave Rocklobster a look of disgust.<br>
   &quot;Who in blazes is Treeburt?&quot; he asked callously. Rocklobster held up the burnt orange suitcase. Swazi punched himself for asking.<br>
   &quot;Well, I'm frightened now,&quot; quavered Finneas, staring at Swazi as he staggered about after molesting himself, &quot;A, anyway...&quot; He turned to Rufus, utterly refusing to acknowledge Swazi's, Quack's, Rocklobster's, and Llama's sudden existence. &quot;How in the bluest of all bleu cheese do we go about fixing this monstrosity?&quot; he sputtered, pointing at the desecrated tank. But he should not have done this, for the point was too much for the tank to handle in its battered state and it caved in on itself.<br>
   &quot;I know. Let's point at it,&quot; proclaimed Rufus sarcastically, &quot;And while we're at it, let's curse our heads off and see where that gets us.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Then what do you suggest we do at this time, O uneducated Rufus of mine, other than point and curse?&quot; Rufus stood silent as a fence post, which are actually quite the attentive, sagely listeners. &quot;Ah. So that's how it is, is it? You criticize me for my actions, yet you don't even know what to do with this atrocity!&quot;  Finneas inadvertently pointed at the tank again, causing the fallen remains to snap neatly in half. He cursed. And his head fell off.<br>
   &quot;I must admit, I don't know what to do with it, but I do know that your method is ineffective. And leaves you... headless.&quot; stated Rufus calmly, attempting to hold back a snicker.<br>
   &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Postman, but Treeburt knows how to fix your sausage. He knows everything.&quot; Rocklobster chimed, addressing Finneas incorrectly.<br>
   &quot;Oh, don't listen to him,&quot; warned Swazi, &quot;He thinks he's a radio.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Very well then,&quot; grunted Finneas, scooping his head off the ground and twisting it back into place, &quot;(It's not completely straight, but it'll do) How, sir, do we go about fixing our tank?&quot; <br>
   &quot;A SCREWDRIVER!!!!&quot; Rocklobster shouted. Rocklobster toddled over to Quack, who was scraping bits of the mailbox off his flesh, and ripped the fish from his hand. He then swayed over to Finneas, waving the fish in his face. &quot;Here.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Er...?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Don't worry. Screwdrivers are quite friendly. It won't bite.&quot;<br>
   &quot;That's...&quot; began Finneas.<br>
   &quot;...a fish.&quot; finished Rufus.<br>
   &quot;Here. Take this screwdriver before it gets bored and takes a walk.&quot; Rocklobster said impatiently, waving the fish more violently.<br>
   &quot;Er, that's a fish, but...&quot; Finneas almost finished saying.<br>
   &quot;...It'll work, right?&quot; Rufus finished for him.<br>
   &quot;Rufus.&quot; Finneas said.<br>
   &quot;Yes, Finneas?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Shut up.&quot;<br>
   Finneas hesitantly took the fish from Rocklobster, who scrunched his burnt orange suitcase up to his ear afterwards and said, &quot;What's that, Treeburt? You want some pudding?&quot; and happily skipped off to go watch Llama beat his left shoe into a bloody pulp through the use of a stoplight.
