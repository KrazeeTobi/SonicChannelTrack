 1   After a long-winded campaign to end all long-winded campaigns, which we will not go into long-winded explanations of due to the fact that there are no long-winded explanations relative to the subject of this particular long-winded campaign, the nations of the world dissolved their individuality, united, and simply called their new worldwide country &quot;The Earth&quot; (on a short-winded note, the major leaders of the world decided, rather than sorting out their differences with violence and bloodshed, to engage in a pleasant game of checkers). For once in the Earth's miserable history, every last inhabitant, including tax collectors, found peace, joy, and an inscrutable attraction to various types of fruitcake.<br>
   But suddenly, out of nowhere, Mr. Cheese single-handedly enslaved the Earth and made giraffes the dominant species.<br>
   This brings this particular narrative up to date.<br>
<br>
   Swazi was of the rebellious sort. In fact, he rebelled just for the gratification rebelling squelched out of him, even if he didn't necessarily disagree with what he was rebelling against. One day, as he sat on a fallen tree in a park somewhere and watched, not necessarily disgusted with the fact, everyone peacefully coping with Mr. Cheese's dominion over them, not to mention the sudden inferiority to giraffes, the urge to rebel surged forth, encompassing every ounce of his being. He ended up inadvertently punching out an innocent passerby wearing a giraffe-skin colored coat in this sudden urge and, being rebellious, refusing to apologize. He was struck with the ideal, not necessarily one he agreed with, that someone should overthrow Mr. Cheese and return the Earth to its former stature. His mind was set. He would be that someone, he would be the Earth's hero. Feeling good about his new ideal, he burned the tree he had sat on and left it utterly unattended as he did, just to be rebellious.<br>
   After about three minutes of scampering about burning things, he decided he'd need some allies, as he didn't stand a chance alone. Those giraffes were quite incessant in their superiority, and wouldn't be taken down easily, especially because of those long necks. If he talked to people about his ideal, he'd be in a nice soft room with a comfy new jacket within seconds. Nobody was so stupid as to go up against the giraffes, for they had long necks. He stomped the ground and cursed those hideous long necks. He decided he'd just play it cool for now. Lay low and watch, wait for idiots crazy enough to fight against long necks. He ran through the park and hid in a trash can, the perfect watching and waiting point for idiots and insanity and the dislike of long necks.<br>
   He spent three years in that trash can. Three rather long, disheartening years.<br>
   But his luck finally showed up, and apologized for its late arrival, as it had had a bit of trouble finding the aisle with the eggs in it at the supermarket. He assured his luck that there was nothing to apologize for and invited it into his trash can for some foolish sap's half-drunk soda and a bit of old tire.<br>
   Simultaneously and at the same time, the revered but often times forgotten Quarkle Urkin Arklin Carmen Kaiser, or Quack, for an acronymic nickname, just happened to be passing through that same park for no apparent reason. And when he passed through that park, he was utterly determined to pass through that park with the utmost lack of reason in the utmost revered-but-often-forgotten way imaginable. Alas, an insane asylum escapee ruined his goal and rather brazenly, or brainlessly, whichever one you prefer, hindered his progress by grappling onto his ankle and acting as though he was picking up radio signals.<br>
   &quot;I say, you fool! Release my ankle!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Have you ever bought a kitten, but then realized that you actually bought a frying pan? At Persimmod's Kitten-But-Actually-A-Frying-Pan clinic, we take great pride in saying, 'You're a moron. A complete imbecile.'&quot;<br>
   &quot;I say! Let go of my ankle!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Buy now and you get another glove absolutely free, even if you don't particularly need it! We sure don't!&quot;

 &quot;It's mine! Get your own!&quot;<br>
   &quot;The Stinkanater Five Billion Action Figure Super Doll Plastic Thing! It's so cool. Buy one now! It's better than you! Now available in all places better than you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;By the godforsaken long-neckedness of the infernal giraffes, LET GO OF MY SNICKER-FRICKIN ANKLE!!!&quot; Quack grabbed a nearby mailbox and lambasted it upon the ankle-clutching escapee. This sent the escapee into a quirky talk show routine.<br>
   &quot;So, George, what do you think about bioengineering, seeing as how you're a bioengineer?<br>
   &quot;Well, I'm indifferent on the subject. Really.<br>
   &quot;Really?<br>
   &quot;Yes. Really.<br>
   &quot;What about nuclear physics?<br>
   &quot;I prefer paper towels, actually.<br>
   &quot;Actually?<br>
   &quot;Yes. Actually.<br>
   &quot;Why exactly is that?<br>
   &quot;I never particularly wanted to be on this talk show. It's just a favor for my friend, so shut up with all the stupid questions, you nosey good for nothing.<br>
   &quot;Nosey good for nothing?<br>
   &quot;Yes. Nosey good for nothing.&quot;<br>
   As Quack shouted his lungs out, not literally, over the escapee's obscurity, Swazi was struck with a sudden apprehension. Out of his frustration, this particular man had shouted the words &quot;godforsaken long-neckedness of those infernal giraffes&quot; in the same sentence- which was pretty rare in those days- due to the radio signal-broadcasting insane asylum escapee grappling his ankle. And it is a well known fact that when someone shouts something out of frustration due to a radio signal-broadcasting insane asylum escapee grappling their ankle, it can only have come from the deepest confines of their heart and soul. Or gallbladder. How perfect. Why couldn't he have come three years earlier? Because it was just that perfect.<br>
   Swazi emerged from the trash can, frightening an old lady that was passing by into a coma. He didn't do anything to aid her, of course, because he was a rebel. He scampered over to the confined-ankle man, who was now relentlessly beating the tar out of the insane asylum escapee with a fish he had just happened to find amongst the debris of the mailbox.<br>
   &quot;What I don't get,&quot; broadcasted the escapee, &quot;is the significance behind the shave the whales campaign. I mean, they're just so darn huge! Do you know how long it might take to shave just one of those things? Nobody's crazy enough to actually want to spend three months straight shaving a single whale! Can't they just shave themselves?&quot;<br>
   &quot;You infernal beast of Hades! If I must beat you into oblivion to regain the use of this ankle, then by the infernal beasts of Hades, I will!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ahem,&quot; ahemed Swazi, &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Slightly-Familiar-Looking-But-Not-Quite-Identifiable Man, but I couldn't help overhear you yelling abou---&quot;<br>
   &quot;And in other news, an entire truck of molasses up and disappeared yesterday morning. More details at 6:00.&quot; interrupted the escapee.<br>
   &quot;You will release this ankle before I count to ten, or I will personally see to it that every last appendage on your miserable carcass is torn off, crushed, melted, and thrown into the sea! One... Two... Three...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Excuse me, but I--&quot;<br>
   &quot;Studies show that imported wines are actually fossil fuels.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Four... Five... Six...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Pardon my intrusion, but---&quot;<br>
   &quot;And he fades back, back, back... Going long... Still fading... Still backing... Still longing... This is it!!! Ooooh! Ouch! Right through the wall!! Maybe he shouldn't have faded back so much...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Seven... Eight...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Sir, I was sitting in that trash can over there, and---&quot;<br>
   &quot;And now back to All My Children's Toenails.<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany!<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany!<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany!<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Nine...&quot;<br>
   &quot;YOUR MOTHER'S A MISBEGOTTEN GOAT!!!&quot; shouted Swazi in desperation. The man and the escapee ceased their activities and stared reproachfully at Swazi. &quot;Excuse me, sir, but I couldn't help overhearing you shout up into the heavens about some sort of dislike for the giraffes...&quot;<br>
   &quot;I assure you she is not!&quot; the man retorted, his lip trembling a bit.<br>
   &quot;Woo... Pineapples are less pungent than you.&quot; stated the escapee flatly.

  &quot;Listen, I only said that to get your attention. Now then, about your dislike of the giraffes...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; they said simultaneously, resuming their activity.<br>
   &quot;Get off!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Looking for the perfect gift? Try looking in a dumpster.&quot;<br>
   &quot;YOUR COUSIN WATCHES EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION!!!&quot; Swazi shouted in revived desperation. They receased their activities and restared at him rereproachfully.<br>
   &quot;Were you shouting that to get our attention as well?&quot; the escapee retorted flatly.<br>
   &quot;Rebellion! Rebellion! Rebellion! Giraffes! Mr. Cheese! Trash can! Three years!&quot; He shouted insanely, flailing his arms about uselessly. The escapee looked up at Quack, still steadfastly anchoring him down by the ankle.<br>
   &quot;Did you get any of that?&quot; he asked him doubtfully.<br>
   &quot;No.&quot; was his reply.<br>
   &quot;Neither did I. It just sort of went underneath the neck, if you know what I'm saying.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Will you idiots form a rebellion with me? Please? I've been needing one for the past three years, in which I have spent the time gnawing on old tires in a trash can.&quot; The two of them considered this thoughtfully, or at least, one of them did. Indeed, they were idiots, and indeed, they could tell that he had been in a trash can gnawing on tires for three years. What the heck?<br>
   &quot;Certainly, lad. I'd be glad to rebel. What exactly are we rebelling against?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Mr. Cheese and his dominion of giraffes.&quot; More thoughtful/less consideration.<br>
   &quot;Certainly, lad. I'd be glad to rebel. What exactly are we rebelling against?&quot; Quack repeated, not entirely certain he had heard the reply correctly. Swazi shook his head.<br>
   &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Allow me to introduce myself. I am Quarkle Urkin Arklin Carmen Kaiser.&quot; he said suavely, extending his hand. Swazi stared benightedly at the hand.<br>
   &quot;Right, but who are you?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ahem, well. Yes. Just... Just call me Quack, all right?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Most people don't realize something is missing, or rather, being ignored, until it is brought to their attention.&quot; stated the escapee matter-of-factly.<br>
   &quot;I guess you can come, too,&quot; Swazi sighed, staring down at Quack's ankle, &quot;I see you've already made a friend.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I believe he is amorously infatuated with my ankle.&quot; said Quack.<br>
   &quot;And what shall I address you by, O one who cuts off the circulation to ankles?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Thank you kindly, Gifford, but I'm allergic to shellfish.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Er, right. We'll call you Rocklobster.<br>
   &quot;My name's Swazi. Swazi Land.&quot;<br>
   &quot;What shall we call our little force?&quot; Quack inquired, &quot;We need a hearty name. One that can be remembered. One that will state our cause, whatever that may be... One that says 'Hey! We're rebels! Get me a sandwich!'&quot;<br>
   &quot;How about 'Fred'?&quot; suggested Rocklobster.<br>
   &quot;No. Not that sort of name.&quot; replied Quack.<br>
   &quot;Harold?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Uhh... I meant more along the lines of a concept or organization, not a person.&quot; <br>
   &quot;Wal-mart?&quot;<br>
   &quot;That's already been taken. We need to compose one.&quot;<br>
   &quot;McFredward's House of European Tacos?&quot;<br>
   &quot;All right, now you're just being stupid. Think more about concepts and stop, well, being stupid.&quot;<br>
   &quot;How about 'Tax'? Taxes are concepts.&quot;<br>
   &quot;If I may interject... SwaziLand.&quot; interjected Swazi.<br>
   &quot;Do what now?&quot; do-whated Quack.<br>
   &quot;SwaziLand!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Swaziland doesn't exist anymore. It was dissolved with all the other countries.&quot;<br>
   &quot;No. No. I meant that as a name. SwaziLand. It's a combination of my first and last name. How's that? Eh? Eh? I think it fits, seeing as how I organized this rebellion.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Hmmm...&quot; hmmm-ed Quack, &quot;You have a point there, Mr. Land. I was sort of leaning towards Tax, but SwaziLand works, too.&quot;<br>
   &quot;And what about you?&quot; asked Swazi, looking down at Rocklobster, who was now sucking on Quack's ankle, &quot;What do you think of the name SwaziLand?&quot;<br>
   &quot;I don't think, Gifford. I don't think.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Then it's settled. We are now the SwaziLand Anti-Cheese 'n Giraffe Battalion Legion Force Resistance Movement. SwaziLand, for short.&quot;

And so the beginning of the rebellion was formed. In celebration, the three ran to the nearest roadside, hijacked a jeep as it was driving by, tossed the driver into a lake, spray-painted the phrase &quot;Giraffes have long necks&quot; on the exterior wall of a footwear store and later threw large rocks at that same store's windows.<br>
<br>
   Swazi spent hours upon hours during the night erecting a three-second, crudely crafted, yet still legible, incomprehensibly unambiguous and attention drawing sign that read &quot;SWAZILAND HEADQUARTERS&quot; in the park. He had chosen the location of their resistance movement's headquarters and, ironically, it was centered around the trash can he loathed so much.<br>
   &quot;All right. Our first tactical meeting,&quot; stated Swazi, as he headed towards the podium, which was actually the trash can, &quot;All in favor, say 'aye'.&quot; Quack stared benightedly at him.<br>
   &quot;Er...?&quot; began Quack.<br>
   &quot;No, 'aye'.&quot; corrected Swazi.<br>
   &quot;Uhh...&quot;<br>
   &quot;'Aye'&quot;<br>
   &quot;Wha?&quot;<br>
   &quot;'AYE!!'&quot;<br>
   &quot;What about my eye?&quot;<br>
   &quot;It's about to be gouged out, if you don't get it right!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Get what right?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Aye.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yes. I have two of those.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Aye. Not eye.&quot;<br>
   &quot;You're speaking in riddles.&quot;<br>
   &quot;ARGHH!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;You haven't proposed anything yet, Gifford.&quot; honked Rocklobster. Swazi's face reddened.<br>
   &quot;Oh, uh, right. I say, we rebel against the giraffes! All in favor, say 'aye'!&quot;<br>
   &quot;We already decided on that, Gifford. We already decided on that.&quot;<br>
   &quot;All in favor of saying aye, say 'aye'.&quot;<br>
   No response.<br>
   &quot;All in favor of saying aye, say 'aye'!&quot;<br>
   Still no response.<br>
   &quot;Say aye, you miserable misbegotten insects! Say aye!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;We're not in favor, Gifford.&quot; Rocklobster pointed out.<br>
   &quot;Well, I want a joyous chorus of 'ayes' to burst forth and toss me backward, so, all- regardless of whether or not you're in favor- say 'aye'!&quot; Rocklobster yelled 'toothpick' and Quack, still benighted, produced a pathetic excuse of an attempt to say 'aye.'<br>
   &quot;Ah... Oh.. Hrrm...&quot; mumbled Swazi, stunned by what he just realized, &quot;I'm stunned. You know what I just realized? It hit me like a ton of potato shavings.&quot; He sighed and turned his back to his rather confused and dwindling audience. &quot;There's only three members of SwaziLand. Only three members. It couldn't be four, it couldn't be two. Three. I hate the number three! It's so... Three-like!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Not to mention that we're far outnumbered by the giraffes.&quot; stated Quack, as his mind dipped itself in apprehension and snapped his being back to reality. &quot;To rectify this dilemma, I propose we gather more members.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Wonderful! Brilliant! Suave! Why didn't I think of that?&quot; He shot them a dark look. &quot;Don't answer that.<br>
  &quot;All in favor, say 'aye'.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Aye.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ham sandwich.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Close enough. So, we're off to gather more members, are we? This'll prove interesting. And non-three-like.&quot;<br>
   And so they left their base of operations completely obvious and open to attack to gather more members.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Sir, do you see this receipt?&quot; barked Llama furiously, waving a &quot;Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff&quot; receipt wildly in the air.<br>
   &quot;I could if you'd stop wavin' it around like some deranged howler monkey!&quot; retorted the cashier, snatching the Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff receipt from Llama's hand. He read through it once. &quot;So what's the problem?&quot; he inquired.<br>
   &quot;What's the problem? What's the problem!? Sir, I suggest you take a good look at that receipt.&quot; barked Llama. The cashier studied it with such ferocity that his eyes nearly caused the receipt to burst into flames.<br>
   &quot;All right, now, what's the problem?&quot; he asked again. Llama banged his hands down upon the countertop.<br>
   &quot;You can't even see it? And it's your job to do stuff like this? How much do they pay you here?&quot;<br>
   &quot;$5.00 an hour.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, they should pay you minimum wage! (How much is that, anyway?)&quot;<br>
   &quot;$5.00 an hour.&quot; <br>
   &quot;Well, anyway, about the receipt! Do you not see that it is all horribly wrong?&quot;<br>
   &quot;That's very fascinating, but do you want fries or tater tots?&quot;<br>
   &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;This is McLardy's. Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff is across the street.&quot; Llama glanced around the facility, taking special note of all the enormous signs, banners, plaques, torches, laser shows, and stock market ratings that spelled out &quot;Welcome to McLardy's&quot; in ridiculously bold print.<br>
   &quot;Oh. Erm, well, uh...&quot; rationalized Llama.<br>
   &quot;Fries or tater tots?&quot;<br>
   Suddenly, Rocklobster flung himself through a giant pane of glass next to the entrance door, which just happened to be wide open.<br>
   &quot;I didn't know there was a 'Q' in 'McLardy's.'&quot; he proclaimed, holding up one of the letters that had previously been encased in the window. Swazi shattered through the other window next to the wide-open entrance door.<br>
   &quot;A lot of people don't know that,&quot; he replied, &quot;McLardy's is actually spelled M-C-L-Q-R-D-Y-'-S. I don't know. It's French, or something. Anyway, MCLQRDY'S is a bit hard to pronounce, so they renamed it McLardy's.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Gifford... You know things.... Are you a duck?&quot; inquired Rocklobster.<br>
   &quot;Wh-what?&quot;<br>
   &quot;A duck.&quot;<br>
   &quot;N-no... What sort of vile demon possessed you and made you ask that?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ducks work for the government. And the government knows things.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Hello? What's this? Have you not noticed that the world is an anarchy!? WE HAVE NO GOVERNMENT!! JUST A BUNCH OF HONKING GIRAFFES AND SOME SUPREME DAIRY PRODUCT!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Tune in next week to hear a snail slowly devour itself in someone's wet slipper.&quot; broadcasted Rocklobster.<br>
   &quot;Have you people ever heard of a convenient little invention called a 'door?'&quot; inquired Quack as he walked towards the wide-open entrance door, &quot;It's really quite handy.&quot;<br>
   &quot;NOOOOO!!! QUACK!!! GET BACK!!!&quot; shouted Swazi, his eyes nearly leaping from their sockets and his arms moving so fast that the word &quot;washer&quot; became visible in their wake. Quack ceased going towards the door, glanced about nervously and with a bit of ignorance, then slowly backed up. Swazi collapsed with relief, then cursed, because he fell in glass.<br>
   &quot;Why shouldn't I use the door?&quot; Quack asked, his voice slightly trembling. As if to conveniently demonstrate the answer to his question, two random salespersons shoved Quack aside and headed for the entrance. One was carrying a burnt orange briefcase, which is pertinent to the storyline, I assure you. They walked through the door. Upon reaching the interior of McLardy's, they immediately noticed that something had gone terribly wrong.<br>
   &quot;Fred...&quot; whimpered the suitcase-less salesperson, &quot;You're turning into a penguin. Stop it.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I'm afraid I can't honor your request, Nigel,&quot; stated Fred, the salesperson with the burnt orange suitcase, &quot;as your head seems to be receding into your chest.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ack! I can't control my arms anymore!&quot; exclaimed Nigel, &quot;And I'm pretty certain that they aren't supposed to bend and stretch that way, either.&quot; Nigel's arms flailed about like a flimsy tape ruler and turned purple in coloration. Unexpectedly, they shot outward in an extending fashion, broke out an unbroken window near the entrance, deliberately avoiding the broken ones, uprooted a lamppost thirty feet away and lambasted it upon an ice cream truck that just happened to be driving by. By now, his head was fully inside of his chest, and a foot was growing out of his stomach.<br>
   &quot;Howl howl howl grunt howl howl grunt&quot; explained Fred, who was now a full-fledged penguin with a minor throat mutation, &quot;grunt howl gurgle howl howl crack snap whistle howl grunt grunt howl howl grunt.&quot; A frying pan materialized over penguin Fred's head and made good use of the law of gravity.<br>
   &quot;Fred,&quot; shouted Nigel's second head, &quot;Fred. Am I supposed to be this yellow? How many of me do you see?&quot; There were about forty-eight of him prancing about the place, doing a wide variety of assorted fruitless tasks.<br>
   &quot;Make it stop! Make it stop!&quot; pleaded Quack, tearing his clothes, &quot;I can't bear to stomach any more of this traumatizing display of horrific transmogrified salesmen!! Make it stop!&quot;

The clerk pulled out a shotgun and blasted numerous holes through the salesmen, who had to be shot again before they realized they were dead. They all stood there aimlessly and stared at what could've been classified as lifeless corpses.<br>
   &quot;I think I'll take tater tots,&quot; decided Llama casually. The clerk punched the numbers in on the register and handed him a small cardboard box with some fries in it. &quot;Thanks much, sir.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Don't forget your receipt,&quot; reminded the cashier, handing him the receipt. Llama's face went blank. It was odd, but everyone present could have sworn that the cashier made a huge emphasis on the word receipt, so it sounded like &quot;reeeeeeeeeeeeceeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipppppppttttttttttt.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Re........ceipt....?&quot; he asked, clutching the receipt uncertainly. He looked at the receipt. He looked at the receipt again. He looked at the receipt again to make sure he had been looking at a receipt the first two times. A fire kindled in his eyes. &quot;RECEIPT!!!&quot; he shouted. He grabbed the register and inconveniently flung it through another unbroken window, causing it to fly thirty feet and break down an ice cream truck that just happened to be driving by. It wasn't possible for him to do this again, but by gum, he did it again anyway, shattering yet another window and breaking down yet another ice cream truck that just happened to be driving by. He grabbed a plastic spoon and began beating the tar out of the receipt. Swazi saw an opportunity at hand, but failed to realize it, so Quack realized it for him. He trotted over to Llama.<br>
   &quot;Excuse me, Mr....&quot; began Quack.<br>
   &quot;RECEIPT! RECEIPT!! RECEIPT!!!&quot; shouted Llama, blinded by his inscrutable fury.<br>
   &quot;Uhm, sir...&quot;<br>
   &quot;RECEIPT! RECEIPT!! RECEIPT!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
   &quot;RECEIPT! RECEIPT!! RECEIPT!!!&quot; Quack calmly walked over to the cashier.<br>
   &quot;May I borrow your shotgun?&quot; he asked politely. The cashier handed it to him. He walked over to where Llama was battering the receipt. He carelessly aimed the gun at the receipt and fired, eradicating all that was a receipt and the end of the plastic spoon. Llama froze, staring at the black crater where the receipt had been, momentarily glancing at the bit of smoldering plastic that was burning a hole through his hand. Quack leaned on the shotgun.<br>
   &quot;So, you look like you have a lot of energy. And you seem to be quite the combatant when it comes to... receipts,&quot; A slight convulsion from Llama. &quot;We could use your skills, sir. How would you like to join our little resistance movement? We're gonna overthrow the giraffes and Mr. Cheese! Doesn't that sound entertaining?&quot;<br>
   &quot;It sounds like suicide.&quot; retorted Llama flatly. A slight convulsion from Quack.<br>
   &quot;Well, er...&quot;<br>
   &quot;And now that I actually sit down and listen to the word 'SUICIDE,' I find that I think the word sounds pretty cool. Sure, I'll help with your dairy/longneck extermination.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Hey, guys?&quot; bellowed Swazi, &quot;Could ya help me out here? I've fallen in glass and I can't get up, and it's really painful, and I'm sure that the glass thinks so, too.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Oh, that's you over there?&quot; replied Quack, &quot;I thought you were that hideous thing over there, with the burnt orange suitcase and shotgun holes. You do sort of look like it...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ha ha. You're a riot. A real stand up kinda guy. Now, HELP ME UP HELP ME UP HELP ME UP!!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Tsk tsk, Gifford,&quot; reprimanded Rocklobster, &quot;Playing in the glass again. How many times do I have to swing a sack of potatoes in Berlin before you realize that glass is not your friend? No beans for you, young man!&quot; Swazi decided he better come up with a particularly clever retort to counter Rocklobster's mockery.<br>
   &quot;...?&quot; was as far as he got.<br>
   After a while, they did eventually help him up.<br>
   And the glass was very thankful.<br>
   I might also mention that Rocklobster acquired the burnt orange suitcase and took it back with him, mistaking it for a bowl of fruit.<br>

   &quot;So, where are we off to now, Mr. Land?&quot; inquired Quack, as he held on for dear life in the back-seat of the stolen jeep, &quot;Off to gather more would-be members?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Don't talk to me. I'm driving.&quot; Swazi replied, hastily. He was sweating by the bucketful and his eyes were an unnatural shade of lime-green with black and hazel polka dots.<br>
   &quot;A stop sign erected itself at the end of the street,&quot; sang Rocklobster exuberantly, caressing the burnt orange suitcase, &quot;So the end of the street became a predestined stopping point for passersby...&quot; Llama, who was also hanging on for his life in the back seat of the stolen jeep, glanced quizzically at Swazi.<br>
   &quot;Is he always this... musical?&quot; he asked.<br>
   &quot;Don't talk to me. I'm driving.&quot; replied Swazi, hastily. His grip on the steering wheel was so tight that his hands were turning black due to loss of circulation.<br>
   &quot;He seems to possess the uncanny ability to receive and broadcast radio waves,&quot; Quack explained, nearly tumbling out of the near-tumbling vehicle, &quot;He's a sort of... biological radio, if you will.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Because most people interpret a red flattened hexagonal shape on the end of a pole with big white letters that spell out 'STOP' to signify that they better stop...&quot;<br>
   &quot;If I have to endure anymore of this wretched song,&quot; stated Llama, on the verge of insanity, &quot;then I'll gnaw my arms and legs off and find a creative way to strangle myself with them.&quot;<br>
   &quot;So they do, ain't that just grand?...&quot;<br>
   &quot;You get used to it after a while, I guess,&quot; stated Quack suavely, &quot;I mean, at least he hasn't sucked on your ank--- GOOD GRACIOUS, SWAZI!! THE TANK!!!&quot; In his utter bewilderment, Quack leapt forward and inadvertently elbowed Swazi in the side of the head.<br>
   &quot;Oh sh--&quot; began Swazi, brazenly swerving off to the left and out of the path of the ominous tank that sped by. Three of the four passengers relaxed. One picked up radio signals.<br>
   &quot;I guess that's just the way the world works, and I find it rather odd...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, guys. That was frightening. My bladder just emptied itself.&quot; Swazi declared, rather uncalled for.<br>
   &quot;But I wish I were a camel...&quot;<br>
   &quot;At least we weren't crushed to death by that--- GOOD GRACIOUS, SWAZI!! THE DUMPSTER!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;In the middle of the road?&quot; The jeep smashed headlong into a dumpster, launching its passengers a mile or so down the street. Rocklobster continued singing the first two thousand six hundred forty feet, but forgot the lyrics, so he hummed the rest of the way.<br>
   A red-hued tank hummed happily down the road. It didn't feel the need to worry about traffic, as it just crunched and flattened every misfortunate car, motorcycle, ice cream truck, roadblock, streetlight, and French timpani player that just happened to feel like getting in its way. The driver particularly enjoyed rush hour. Whenever it came time to turn a nasty little corner, out of sheer laziness, it plowed a new street through the unlucky structure that inadvertently obscured its path. Mainly dental clinics. Now, as I mentioned 450 characters ago, the tank was humming happily down the road. Unfortunately, its happiness was broken by some abrupt engine problems.<br>
   hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br>
   FOOOM!!<br>
   hummmm-sputter-sputter-ptooie-hum-sputter-sputter<br>
   BANG!!<br>
   sizzle<br>
   A steady stream of smoke sifted its way out of the exhaust pipe and entrance hatch, not to mention the underside of the vessel. The hatch flung open with a puff of smoke and out emerged two figures, coughing and sputtering and flailing their arms about.<br>
   &quot;DAG-BLAST IT!!&quot; shouted Finneas, &quot;WE HIT ANOTHER GODFORSAKEN SNAIL!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Oh, come off it, Finneas,&quot; coughed Rufus. Finneas gave Rufus a rather cold and murderous stare.<br>
   &quot;Come off it?! Come off it!?! We just bought the thing, for goodness sake!! A fine vessel this turned out to be! It has no problem plowing through walls or crawling over cars, but by gum, you put a snail in its path and the thing goes and blows up in your face!&quot;<br>
   &quot;We can always return it,&quot; Rufus reminded sagely, &quot;Just make sure you have the receipt.&quot;

     &quot;We can't return this piece of souped-up crap to Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff because some wild-eyed maniac ripped the receipt clean out of my hands as we were walkin' out to the lot and ran into the McLardy's across the street. Then, right as I'm about to reclaim what is rightfully mine, some brilliant misbegotten insect goes and eradicates the receipt with a shotgun!!&quot;<br>
   Llama burst out of the remains of a nearby fire hydrant.<br>
   &quot;RECEIPT!?!?!?!?!&quot; he shouted, grabbing a bit of broken streetlight and feverishly beating it against his shoe, &quot;WOOKIE WOOKIE WOOKIE!!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Gracious,&quot; sighed Quack, emerging from a desecrated mailbox with a fish, &quot;Of all the lousy... A dumpster? Look, if you were going to crash, you could've at least hit another car, or a wall or something decent. But no. What do you hit? A dumpster.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I swear,&quot; complained Swazi, pushing the building debris off his carcass and picking the glass out of his teeth, &quot;that dumpster just sort of jumped out in front of me. I didn't see it coming at all!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Treeburt saw it coming,&quot; proclaimed Rocklobster, dislodging himself from a brick wall, still clutching the burnt orange suitcase, &quot;He sees everything.&quot; Swazi gave Rocklobster a look of disgust.<br>
   &quot;Who in blazes is Treeburt?&quot; he asked callously. Rocklobster held up the burnt orange suitcase. Swazi punched himself for asking.<br>
   &quot;Well, I'm frightened now,&quot; quavered Finneas, staring at Swazi as he staggered about after molesting himself, &quot;A, anyway...&quot; He turned to Rufus, utterly refusing to acknowledge Swazi's, Quack's, Rocklobster's, and Llama's sudden existence. &quot;How in the bluest of all bleu cheese do we go about fixing this monstrosity?&quot; he sputtered, pointing at the desecrated tank. But he should not have done this, for the point was too much for the tank to handle in its battered state and it caved in on itself.<br>
   &quot;I know. Let's point at it,&quot; proclaimed Rufus sarcastically, &quot;And while we're at it, let's curse our heads off and see where that gets us.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Then what do you suggest we do at this time, O uneducated Rufus of mine, other than point and curse?&quot; Rufus stood silent as a fence post, which are actually quite the attentive, sagely listeners. &quot;Ah. So that's how it is, is it? You criticize me for my actions, yet you don't even know what to do with this atrocity!&quot;  Finneas inadvertently pointed at the tank again, causing the fallen remains to snap neatly in half. He cursed. And his head fell off.<br>
   &quot;I must admit, I don't know what to do with it, but I do know that your method is ineffective. And leaves you... headless.&quot; stated Rufus calmly, attempting to hold back a snicker.<br>
   &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Postman, but Treeburt knows how to fix your sausage. He knows everything.&quot; Rocklobster chimed, addressing Finneas incorrectly.<br>
   &quot;Oh, don't listen to him,&quot; warned Swazi, &quot;He thinks he's a radio.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Very well then,&quot; grunted Finneas, scooping his head off the ground and twisting it back into place, &quot;(It's not completely straight, but it'll do) How, sir, do we go about fixing our tank?&quot; <br>
   &quot;A SCREWDRIVER!!!!&quot; Rocklobster shouted. Rocklobster toddled over to Quack, who was scraping bits of the mailbox off his flesh, and ripped the fish from his hand. He then swayed over to Finneas, waving the fish in his face. &quot;Here.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Er...?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Don't worry. Screwdrivers are quite friendly. It won't bite.&quot;<br>
   &quot;That's...&quot; began Finneas.<br>
   &quot;...a fish.&quot; finished Rufus.<br>
   &quot;Here. Take this screwdriver before it gets bored and takes a walk.&quot; Rocklobster said impatiently, waving the fish more violently.<br>
   &quot;Er, that's a fish, but...&quot; Finneas almost finished saying.<br>
   &quot;...It'll work, right?&quot; Rufus finished for him.<br>
   &quot;Rufus.&quot; Finneas said.<br>
   &quot;Yes, Finneas?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Shut up.&quot;<br>
   Finneas hesitantly took the fish from Rocklobster, who scrunched his burnt orange suitcase up to his ear afterwards and said, &quot;What's that, Treeburt? You want some pudding?&quot; and happily skipped off to go watch Llama beat his left shoe into a bloody pulp through the use of a stoplight.

Finneas stared at the fish. Rufus was smiling slightly. Smiling in a sort of smug, arrogant-yet-modest way.<br>
   &quot;I'm terribly sorry, sir,&quot; Swazi apologized, &quot;We need to get a leash for him, or something. He doesn't know right from green.&quot;<br>
   &quot;What the heck?&quot; Finneas shrugged his shoulders and swung the fish about lightly. &quot;It's better than cursing my head off. And much more entertaining,&quot; He handed the fish to Rufus, mumbling triumphantly about how he'd look so stupid fruitlessly smacking a tank with a fish. Rufus smirked and briskly slapped the fish against the tank debris. Instantaneously, the tank appeared before them fully in tact and humming happily. Swazi, Finneas, and Quack stood in awe. Rufus stood in gum, smirking sagely nonetheless.<br>
   &quot;I... How...?&quot; began Swazi.<br>
   &quot;Huh...? Wha...?&quot; suggested Quack.<br>
   &quot;But... and...&quot; concluded Finneas.<br>
   &quot;It's all in the wrist.&quot; assured Rufus, modestly. The gears in Swazi's brain fell into place.<br>
   &quot;A tank!&quot; he cried, &quot;We could use one of those!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yeah, well, it's not for sale, debris-boy.&quot; grunted Finneas.<br>
   &quot;No no no no no. I didn't mean it like that. I meant... Well, you see, we're sort of contemplating this little rebellion...&quot; And so Swazi explained to them the situation and pleaded for their help.<br>
   &quot;Are you crazy?!&quot; shouted Finneas, when Swazi asked for their assistance, &quot;Oppose Mr. Cheese?! It's absurd! It's suicide! It's absurd suicide, for crying out loud!&quot;<br>
   &quot;But... But... But we can restore order to the world! We can kick those sorry giraffes out of control- maybe even launch them into orbit or something- and humans can dominate the earth once more!&quot; Swazi said.<br>
   &quot;No! We won't help you! C'mon, Rufus! Let's go.&quot; He headed to the left side of the tank. Rufus stood still as a fence post, which are rather diligent at remaining motionless. Finneas backed up and stood next to Rufus, staring at him. &quot;Well? Are you coming?&quot;<br>
   Rufus swung the fish with such ferocity that it took Finneas a minute or two to realize he'd been nailed in the face by a seafaring critter.<br>
   &quot;Is your head fixed now?&quot; Rufus asked quietly. Finneas nodded.<br>
   &quot;Yeah, thanks. It wasn't quite screwed in correctly. Anyway, this is the perfect opportunity to restore balance to the world. To put giraffes in their rightful place. To restore democracy and banish anarchy. Yeah, we'll join your little rebellion.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ah, the reparative properties of fish...&quot; Rufus began airily.<br>
   &quot;Gifford!&quot; Rocklobster shouted, &quot;The pudding likes you!&quot; <br>
   &quot;What about pudd---&quot; Swazi ceased his question right about the time a forlorn shoe slammed into his face. He fell to the floor, then cursed, because he fell in glass.<br>
   &quot;Aw, isn't that sweet, Treeburt?&quot; Rocklobster inquired of his suitcase, &quot;Gifford's playing in glass because the pudding kissed him. They grow up so fast...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Er, sorry about that!&quot; piped Llama, &quot;I didn't mean to throw my pudding- er, I mean, shoe- in that direction. I wasn't aiming for you! I promise! Really!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ahem. Well,&quot; said Quack, deciding that if he didn't say something relevant to the storyline that this narrative would go nowhere fast, much like it already has, &quot;You wouldn't mind giving us a lift back in that tank, would you? Our jeep's about a mile away, partially crushed against a dumpster.&quot;<br>
<br>
   For those of you who can't bother with keeping track, there are now seven members of SwaziLand. One of which is supposedly a suitcase.

   Swazi, Rocklobster, Quack, Llama, Rufus and Finneas emerged from the uncomfortably small entrance hatch of the tank. Simultaneously.<br>
   &quot;Hey, thanks for the lift, Finneas. It would've taken us quite a while to get back here if you hadn't smashed through that dental clinic,&quot; praised Quack, &quot;And I got a free toothbrush.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Anything for my new comrades, comrade.&quot; replied Finneas, a hint of arrogance in his voice.<br>
   &quot;Yeah, but we were packed in there like sardines,&quot; Swazi pointed out, &quot;If you had charged us but ten cents for the ride, we'd still be getting ripped off. I mean, not to say I hate tanks. Tanks are a nice commodity for mad drivers such as myself, seeing as they can plow right through the busiest of rush hours, but they're not so much for luxury, are they? I'm just glad I have a jeep to--- MY JEEP!!!!&quot; Swazi stood aghast in the radiance of his- ...technically it wasn't his, but...- once glorious jeep, which was now about half of its original size and smoldering something terrible. Oddly enough, the dumpster wasn't anywhere to be found.<br>
   &quot;Gah! Look at that! I'm gonna kill the person who did this to my jeep!&quot; sputtered Swazi, shaking his fists in rage. Quack looked off a little to the left and attempted to quell a sliver of a smile.<br>
   &quot;If I do recall correctly, was it not you who crashed into the dumpster, or am I hallucinating?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Y, you're delirious!&quot; Swazi sputtered. &quot;(Hm... I guess suicide's on my to-do list again... Why can't I just buckle down and see a psychiatrist?)&quot; A scene flashed before Swazi's eyes:<br>
   &quot;Now, tell me again. Your problem.&quot; commanded the psychiatrist softly.<br>
   &quot;I have to commit suicide, but I don't want to.&quot; Swazi stated.<br>
   &quot;Ah. Oh. Well, uh, tell me about your childhood.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, let's see... My mother wasn't quite married when she conceived me. In fact, she never got married. Never had sexual intercourse, either.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Intriguing...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yeah. She went to a DNA bank and found someone's toenail. No need to go into detail.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yes. Quite so.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, my mother really didn't want to take care of me, so I was shoved into a sock and put out for the milkman to pick up at the age of three And she had a beard...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
   &quot;And I was raised by a pack of rhinos...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Umm hmm...&quot;<br>
   &quot;And I got a turtle stuck up my nose at age thirteen.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Fascinating.&quot;<br>
   &quot;So. That's it. What's wrong with me?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Huh? Hang on a minute, Harold.&quot; The psychiatrist glanced scornfully at Swazi and put his hand over the receiver of his cell phone. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
   Swazi blinked back to the present, with an answer to his muttered question.<br>
   &quot;That was a rather awkward flashback, wouldn't you say, Swazi?&quot; Quack leered immediately after the cheap and poorly executed scene transition.<br>
   &quot;W-w-what do you mean? Could you see it or something?&quot; Swazi asked hesitantly.<br>
   Quack tried his best to maintain a stern poker face, but he tried a little too much and resembled a man who had been constipated for the last three weeks. &quot;No,&quot; he said in a voice which made him sound like a man who had been constipated for the last three weeks and had a horrendous case of oversized mutant hemorrhoids, producing a sneeze that sounded oddly like mocking laughter afterward. When he asked Llama whether or not he'd seen it, he merely backed away slowly and uttered frantically, &quot;Whoa, you just stay there, pal. Keep your distance.&quot; Finneas didn't even wait for an inquiry. He had something to say, and by gum, he'd say it, regardless of whether or not the rest of them really wanted to hear it.<br>
   &quot;How embarrassing... A turtle? Up your nose? It takes a real idiot to accomplish that feat!! Especially one that's supposedly already a man, by Jewish tradition. So much for that philosophy. I say you're a man when you don't stick large organisms up your nostrils!!&quot; Finneas blasted. Swazi turned to Rufus, reddened by the notion that someone as arrogant as Finneas would be making a jest of his sacred- if not a tad on the bizarre side- memories.

   &quot;Did you see it?&quot;<br>
   &quot;The thing that really gets me is... Well... I thought rhinoceroses were solitary creatures,&quot; Rufus replied sagely, &quot;How, then, could you be raised by a herd of them? That is truly a noteworthy phenomenon, as it is completely illogical. The rhinocerouses would most likely be miles apart from one another! But I guess that illogical principles is what this whole book is founded on, right? Giraffes dominating the world, tanks zipping down busy streets, fish repairing things... Oh, there's so much left not to comprehend.&quot; A gigantic purple spoon drifted its way past the motley group of Anti-Cheese rebels, promptly exploding into a thousand tiny tap-dancing Mexicans further down the street. Swazi looked pleadingly at Rocklobster, completely oblivious of the illogical phenomenon that took place not two seconds earlier.<br>
   &quot;You too?&quot; he squeaked.<br>
   &quot;Frankfuurt the iguana wrote a thank you note on my forehead, Gifford. Isn't that nice of him? I think I should buy him a flying lawyer.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Er... Just for the sake of sanity- which you so determinedly and thoroughly obliterated- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.&quot;<br>
   Suddenly, out of nowhere, an old man with a banjo and a pair of suave sunglasses that didn't at all match his haggard appearance materialized inside Swazi's crumpled stolen jeep. Without so much as glancing at the motley band of would-be revolutionaries, he started the ignition. It was as though it were his entire life's purpose to take Swazi's taken car.<br>
   &quot;HEY!! What're ya doing!?!?&quot; Swazi shouted at the enigmatic old coot, &quot;That's my jeep!! I worked my liver off trying to get that thing, and like any honest, hardworking man, that means I stole it!!&quot; The old man in the car turned his head towards Swazi, winked like a bizarre little hermit who made a point out of materializing inside of broken down cars and then stealing them like it were perfectly natural for him to do so and that the lot of them were quite ignorant and foolish to be standing around wondering why in blazes an old man would just come out of thin air and take possession of their car, and then promptly drove off.<br>
   &quot;Wow,&quot; Llama said breathlessly, struck dumb by the utter irrelevance of the phenomenal previous scene, &quot;Those were some nice sunglasses!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well... It's sardine time again!&quot; Rufus exclaimed cheerily, pointing at the tank, &quot;I get dibs on the top of the pile.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Harold convulsed violently and pulled the towel more closely to his overly-moist body. He swirled his feet around in the large bucket of lukewarm water, realizing that it was supposed to be steaming hot. He sniffled a few times, hoping to catch someone's attention so they could rectify the dilemma. When that didn't work, he forced a fake, yet audible snort, which sent him into a real cacophonous snorting fit that would even put the patients with the worst cases of Whooping Cough to shame. Even after he regained the proper function of his lungs and nostrils, still, nobody noticed him. Finally, he thought he'd get attention the old fashioned way.<br>
   &quot;YOUR COUSIN WATCHES EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION!!!!!&quot;<br>
   Sure enough, he had a buzzing swarm of footwear store employees buzzing about him like a swarm of buzzing swarm buzzers that resembled footwear store employees. He coughed.<br>
   &quot;Yeah. My water's too cold. Make it hot.&quot; He demanded.
