 &quot;It's mine! Get your own!&quot;<br>
   &quot;The Stinkanater Five Billion Action Figure Super Doll Plastic Thing! It's so cool. Buy one now! It's better than you! Now available in all places better than you.&quot;<br>
   &quot;By the godforsaken long-neckedness of the infernal giraffes, LET GO OF MY SNICKER-FRICKIN ANKLE!!!&quot; Quack grabbed a nearby mailbox and lambasted it upon the ankle-clutching escapee. This sent the escapee into a quirky talk show routine.<br>
   &quot;So, George, what do you think about bioengineering, seeing as how you're a bioengineer?<br>
   &quot;Well, I'm indifferent on the subject. Really.<br>
   &quot;Really?<br>
   &quot;Yes. Really.<br>
   &quot;What about nuclear physics?<br>
   &quot;I prefer paper towels, actually.<br>
   &quot;Actually?<br>
   &quot;Yes. Actually.<br>
   &quot;Why exactly is that?<br>
   &quot;I never particularly wanted to be on this talk show. It's just a favor for my friend, so shut up with all the stupid questions, you nosey good for nothing.<br>
   &quot;Nosey good for nothing?<br>
   &quot;Yes. Nosey good for nothing.&quot;<br>
   As Quack shouted his lungs out, not literally, over the escapee's obscurity, Swazi was struck with a sudden apprehension. Out of his frustration, this particular man had shouted the words &quot;godforsaken long-neckedness of those infernal giraffes&quot; in the same sentence- which was pretty rare in those days- due to the radio signal-broadcasting insane asylum escapee grappling his ankle. And it is a well known fact that when someone shouts something out of frustration due to a radio signal-broadcasting insane asylum escapee grappling their ankle, it can only have come from the deepest confines of their heart and soul. Or gallbladder. How perfect. Why couldn't he have come three years earlier? Because it was just that perfect.<br>
   Swazi emerged from the trash can, frightening an old lady that was passing by into a coma. He didn't do anything to aid her, of course, because he was a rebel. He scampered over to the confined-ankle man, who was now relentlessly beating the tar out of the insane asylum escapee with a fish he had just happened to find amongst the debris of the mailbox.<br>
   &quot;What I don't get,&quot; broadcasted the escapee, &quot;is the significance behind the shave the whales campaign. I mean, they're just so darn huge! Do you know how long it might take to shave just one of those things? Nobody's crazy enough to actually want to spend three months straight shaving a single whale! Can't they just shave themselves?&quot;<br>
   &quot;You infernal beast of Hades! If I must beat you into oblivion to regain the use of this ankle, then by the infernal beasts of Hades, I will!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ahem,&quot; ahemed Swazi, &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Slightly-Familiar-Looking-But-Not-Quite-Identifiable Man, but I couldn't help overhear you yelling abou---&quot;<br>
   &quot;And in other news, an entire truck of molasses up and disappeared yesterday morning. More details at 6:00.&quot; interrupted the escapee.<br>
   &quot;You will release this ankle before I count to ten, or I will personally see to it that every last appendage on your miserable carcass is torn off, crushed, melted, and thrown into the sea! One... Two... Three...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Excuse me, but I--&quot;<br>
   &quot;Studies show that imported wines are actually fossil fuels.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Four... Five... Six...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Pardon my intrusion, but---&quot;<br>
   &quot;And he fades back, back, back... Going long... Still fading... Still backing... Still longing... This is it!!! Ooooh! Ouch! Right through the wall!! Maybe he shouldn't have faded back so much...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Seven... Eight...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Sir, I was sitting in that trash can over there, and---&quot;<br>
   &quot;And now back to All My Children's Toenails.<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany!<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany!<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany!<br>
   &quot;Oh Harvey!<br>
   &quot;Oh Melany...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Nine...&quot;<br>
   &quot;YOUR MOTHER'S A MISBEGOTTEN GOAT!!!&quot; shouted Swazi in desperation. The man and the escapee ceased their activities and stared reproachfully at Swazi. &quot;Excuse me, sir, but I couldn't help overhearing you shout up into the heavens about some sort of dislike for the giraffes...&quot;<br>
   &quot;I assure you she is not!&quot; the man retorted, his lip trembling a bit.<br>
   &quot;Woo... Pineapples are less pungent than you.&quot; stated the escapee flatly.
