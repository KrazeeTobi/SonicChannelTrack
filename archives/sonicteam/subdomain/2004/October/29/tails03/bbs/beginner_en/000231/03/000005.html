&quot;This is McLardy's. Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff is across the street.&quot; Llama glanced around the facility, taking special note of all the enormous signs, banners, plaques, torches, laser shows, and stock market ratings that spelled out &quot;Welcome to McLardy's&quot; in ridiculously bold print.<br>
   &quot;Oh. Erm, well, uh...&quot; rationalized Llama.<br>
   &quot;Fries or tater tots?&quot;<br>
   Suddenly, Rocklobster flung himself through a giant pane of glass next to the entrance door, which just happened to be wide open.<br>
   &quot;I didn't know there was a 'Q' in 'McLardy's.'&quot; he proclaimed, holding up one of the letters that had previously been encased in the window. Swazi shattered through the other window next to the wide-open entrance door.<br>
   &quot;A lot of people don't know that,&quot; he replied, &quot;McLardy's is actually spelled M-C-L-Q-R-D-Y-'-S. I don't know. It's French, or something. Anyway, MCLQRDY'S is a bit hard to pronounce, so they renamed it McLardy's.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Gifford... You know things.... Are you a duck?&quot; inquired Rocklobster.<br>
   &quot;Wh-what?&quot;<br>
   &quot;A duck.&quot;<br>
   &quot;N-no... What sort of vile demon possessed you and made you ask that?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ducks work for the government. And the government knows things.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Hello? What's this? Have you not noticed that the world is an anarchy!? WE HAVE NO GOVERNMENT!! JUST A BUNCH OF HONKING GIRAFFES AND SOME SUPREME DAIRY PRODUCT!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Tune in next week to hear a snail slowly devour itself in someone's wet slipper.&quot; broadcasted Rocklobster.<br>
   &quot;Have you people ever heard of a convenient little invention called a 'door?'&quot; inquired Quack as he walked towards the wide-open entrance door, &quot;It's really quite handy.&quot;<br>
   &quot;NOOOOO!!! QUACK!!! GET BACK!!!&quot; shouted Swazi, his eyes nearly leaping from their sockets and his arms moving so fast that the word &quot;washer&quot; became visible in their wake. Quack ceased going towards the door, glanced about nervously and with a bit of ignorance, then slowly backed up. Swazi collapsed with relief, then cursed, because he fell in glass.<br>
   &quot;Why shouldn't I use the door?&quot; Quack asked, his voice slightly trembling. As if to conveniently demonstrate the answer to his question, two random salespersons shoved Quack aside and headed for the entrance. One was carrying a burnt orange briefcase, which is pertinent to the storyline, I assure you. They walked through the door. Upon reaching the interior of McLardy's, they immediately noticed that something had gone terribly wrong.<br>
   &quot;Fred...&quot; whimpered the suitcase-less salesperson, &quot;You're turning into a penguin. Stop it.&quot;<br>
   &quot;I'm afraid I can't honor your request, Nigel,&quot; stated Fred, the salesperson with the burnt orange suitcase, &quot;as your head seems to be receding into your chest.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ack! I can't control my arms anymore!&quot; exclaimed Nigel, &quot;And I'm pretty certain that they aren't supposed to bend and stretch that way, either.&quot; Nigel's arms flailed about like a flimsy tape ruler and turned purple in coloration. Unexpectedly, they shot outward in an extending fashion, broke out an unbroken window near the entrance, deliberately avoiding the broken ones, uprooted a lamppost thirty feet away and lambasted it upon an ice cream truck that just happened to be driving by. By now, his head was fully inside of his chest, and a foot was growing out of his stomach.<br>
   &quot;Howl howl howl grunt howl howl grunt&quot; explained Fred, who was now a full-fledged penguin with a minor throat mutation, &quot;grunt howl gurgle howl howl crack snap whistle howl grunt grunt howl howl grunt.&quot; A frying pan materialized over penguin Fred's head and made good use of the law of gravity.<br>
   &quot;Fred,&quot; shouted Nigel's second head, &quot;Fred. Am I supposed to be this yellow? How many of me do you see?&quot; There were about forty-eight of him prancing about the place, doing a wide variety of assorted fruitless tasks.<br>
   &quot;Make it stop! Make it stop!&quot; pleaded Quack, tearing his clothes, &quot;I can't bear to stomach any more of this traumatizing display of horrific transmogrified salesmen!! Make it stop!&quot;
