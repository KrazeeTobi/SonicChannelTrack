how to get every sp ring... please note that when all 7 are collected in a level then when you finish the level you go to a bonus stage where you must collect 300 rings in 2 mins pretty tight!<br>
<br>
so here is how to get the sp rings<br>
<br>
a. --Leaf Forest / Act 1--<br>
<br>
1st Sp Ring - From the starting position, run forward.  Leap over every gap, <br>
and continue.  You'll reach a loop.  Get on top, and continue up the rail.  <br>
You'll find the ring on top of the second loop.<br>
<br>
2nd Sp Ring - Fall down off the right side of the second loop.  You'll see a <br>
blue spring.  Keep bouncing on it to go higher.  Use your character's UP+R <br>
move to reach the ring.<br>
<br>
3rd Sp Ring - From there, jump into the area on the right adjacent to the blue <br>
spring.  Look for a corkscrew loop.  Once past it, backtrack slowly and fall <br>
underneath it for the next ring.<br>
<br>
4th Sp Ring - Continue forward.  You'll find a very large loop soon after.  A <br>
ring is located inside at the top of the loop.<br>
<br>
5th Sp Ring - Get to the bottom area.  This one is over the 2nd body of water <br>
you come to.  You'll have to skim the surface to get it.<br>
<br>
6th Sp Ring - Get back onto the high road.  Use a ramp to launch yourself atop <br>
another big loop.  Continue along, jumping over gaps and use a second ramp to <br>
launch yourself onto another loop, this one containing the ring.  Go ahead and <br>
let the spring shoot you into the ring.<br>
<br>
7th Sp Ring - This one's located right before the beginning of the very last <br>
grinding rail in the act.  To get there, drop down from the loop and continue <br>
slowly.  When you reach a jump ramp, leap over and fall to the bottom area.  <br>
Backtrack a little past the loop behind you, as you'll need the speed.  Let the <br>
spring there shoot you back up the loop and down the slope, lauching yourself <br>
over from an upslope up to another platform with the ring.<br>
<br>
<br>
b. --Hot Crater / Act 1--<br>
<br>
1st Sp Ring - This one's just above the end of the overhead hand rail.  You can <br>
reach the platform it's on by employing the ramp on top of a nearby loop.  Hit <br>
the hand rail slowly, then leap off and aim your fall between the 2nd and 3rd <br>
ring.  The speed booster and ramp will take you to the platform with the <br>
special ring.<br>
<br>
2nd Sp Ring - After getting ring #1, backtrack and continue along the <br>
bottom-most path.  After awhile, you'll find yourself in a pit room with two <br>
spring turtle baddies.  Use the one on the left to reach a hidden ring inside <br>
the left wall.<br>
<br>
3rd Sp Ring - After getting #2, continue along bottom path.  Eventually, you'll <br>
run into a diagonal spring that will boost you up through a white floor <br>
platform.  Backtrack to find the ring.<br>
<br>
4th Sp Ring - Follow the path after grabbing #3, and you'll grind a rail.  Allow <br>
yourself to automatically leap off the  end and you'll make a grab for an overhang <br>
hook that will propel you up.  You'll see a speed booster.  Jump over and kill the <br>
baddie, then hit the speed booster.  HOLD RIGHT.  You'll go up an upslope and land <br>
on top of a loop, with the ring.<br>
<br>
5th Sp Ring - After #4, drop down and go right.  When you reach the next <br>
overhead hand rail, instead, drop down to the bottom area.  Continue along and <br>
fall into the hole you'll find.  Allow the boost rings to guide you to the Sp <br>
Ring and a safety hook.<br>
<br>
6th Sp Ring - Continue along the bottom.  After a fairly long and downward <br>
slope, you'll hit and upslope with a spike trap next to it.  Use your momentum <br>
to hoist yourself over to a hook that'll throw you upwards.  Use your <br>
character's UP+R move to reach an overhead boost ring that'll get you to the <br>
ring.<br>
<br>
7th Sp Ring - Continue and you'll hit the mid-checkpoint.  Stay up on the <br>
highest areas at all times.  After awhile, you'll hit a speed ramp that'll shoot <br>
you over to a ring and a rail.<br>
<br>
<br>
c. --Music Plant / Act 1--<br>
<br>
1st Sp Ring - After start, travel along the high road, using the musical notes <br>
to keep yourself from falling into the bottom portion.  Soon, you'll come <br>
across a downward slope, and a diagonal cymbal spring.  Jump over the spring to <br>
land on a platform with the ring beneath.<br>
<br>
2nd Sp Ring - Once that's done, fa <br>
