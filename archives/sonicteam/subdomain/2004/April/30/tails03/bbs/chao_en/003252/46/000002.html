&gt; this is called the BAD RAT pledge<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I will not graze on the carpet. <br>
&gt; It is not considered &quot;cool&quot; to beat up rats smaller than myself. <br>
&gt; There is no need to steal treats from others when I am given one of equal size of my own <br>
&gt; I will not leave raisins on the sofa for unsuspecting human butts. <br>
&gt; Pots are for growing plants in, not digging up. <br>
&gt; I will refrain from climbing down the blouses of female visitors. <br>
&gt; There is no nutritional value in used tissues. <br>
&gt; Chewing on electrical cords is not fun, even if it elicits such an enthusiastic response from my human. <br>
&gt; Peeing on the remote control does not give me the right to choose the tv channel, nor does it endear myself to my humans so that they turn the tv off and play with me. <br>
&gt; I will not develop a foam mining enterprise in my human's mattress. <br>
&gt; Unlike their favourite old t-shirt, peeing on their crisp newly ironed white business shirt as they leave for work will not elicit a loving response. <br>
&gt; Licking my goolies in public is considered a faux pas. <br>
&gt; I will not create a fake massacre scene in my cage when I eat red foods. <br>
&gt; Barbering others is nothing more than gratuitous graffiti. <br>
&gt; I will not start a game of hide and seek every time my human calls me back to my cage. <br>
&gt; If I was meant to eat recycled paper pellets, they would be placed in my food bowl rather than my litter tray. <br>
&gt; I will endure a bath like the calm, dignified rodent I am. <br>
&gt; Bath time means a bath, not a chance to jump out and eat the soap. <br>
&gt; I will do my best not to tread in squishy raisins and trample them all over the house and my human. <br>
&gt; I will not find amusement in nipping my cagemate's butt as he exits the hammock. <br>
&gt; Adding urine to my water does not make it taste better. <br>
&gt; When my human lets me out after completing their 100 page assignment, I will refrain from exploring the Delete key. <br>
&gt; Chewing of cage wires does not elicit a favourable response from my human. <br>
&gt; When dinner is being served, I will control myself and share with my cagemates in a sensible fashion. <br>
&gt; I will go about my night-time business in respectful silence. <br>
&gt; When I don't want to go home to the cage yet, I will not wedge myself under immovable furniture. <br>
&gt; I will not give my human a heart attack by sleeping soundly with my eyes open. <br>
&gt; Human saliva is not a tasty treat. <br>
&gt; I am not qualified to give my human a manicure, pedicure, ear cleaning, nose cleaning, or dental exam. <br>
&gt; I will not try to run off to the boy rats' cage at every possible chance. <br>
&gt; The newspaper that lines my shelf does not need to be shredded to bits and thrown out the cage bars. <br>
&gt; I do not need to pee on the magazine my human is reading, even if it is &quot;yellow journalism&quot;. <br>
&gt; My human lovingly handcrafted this cozy hammock for me... so I must not pee in it, poop in it, eat staining foods in it, or chew six holes in it. <br>
&gt; I will refrain from sofa spelunking. <br>
&gt; I will not squeak in bloody terror when my human is trying to give me medicine and I will certainly not spit it out afterwards. <br>
&gt; I will not climb the curtains and play along the curtain rod just out of reach of my human. <br>
&gt; Band-Aids are there for a purpose and are not to be removed without permission. <br>
&gt; I will not sit on top of the boys' cage when I am in heat and flap my ears coyly to drive them insane. <br>
&gt; I will not teach my offspring to be as bad as I am. <br>
&gt; I will not climb into the printer, scanner or paper shredder, especially when it is on. That also goes for the washing machine, clothes dryer, microwave, fridge and dishwasher. <br>
&gt; I will refrain from jumping into my human's coffee mug and then walking coffee prints all over the table. <br>
&gt; My food is placed in my own bowl, not on my human's dinner plate. <br>
&gt; I will not throw bedding out of my cage at the cat. <br>
&gt; When the dog barks at me and sticks his nose into my cage, I will not stoop to his level and bite him... after all, he's just a big stupid beast and doesn't know any better. <br>
&gt; I will not bite my human's earrings, especially when she is wearing them. <br>
&gt; Humping my cagemates is not an acceptable outlet for sexual frustration. <br>
&gt; I will choose a more appropriate place than the litter tray to wre <br>
