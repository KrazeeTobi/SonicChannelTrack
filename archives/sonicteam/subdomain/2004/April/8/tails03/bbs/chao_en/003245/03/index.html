Here's a good fanfic!<br>
<br>
Gem Sonic and the Dark Chao<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: The Dark Lord's Plot<br>
<br>
Once every day, Dark Chao would enter Chao World, then he would ruin everything. Gem Sonic couldn't put up with him, he was just too ANNOYING! So, Sonic blew his bugle, and suddenly, all 67,000,000,000 Chao ran to him. &quot;OK guys!&quot; He called to his team. &quot;I know we have a Dark Chao whose annoying us everyday, and we just can't put up with him any longer! So, Chaos, I need you to buy Defenses and Weapons from the Black Market, and I'm sure we'll be prepared for our attack on Friday! Any questions?&quot; &quot;Sir, no sir!&quot; the Chao replied. At that time, they ran to the Black Market, searching for defenses and weapons while Sonic turned on his computer. &quot;Welcome to Gem Sonic 9.0.&quot; Sonic's computer said. He entered the request, &quot;Send_the_Sobig.F_virus.exe.&quot; Sonic's computer said, &quot;Ok, please wait.&quot; Then, a progress bar appeared saying, &quot;0% completed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: The Defenses and Weapons<br>
<br>
When the progress bar said, &quot;100% completed&quot;, the computer said, &quot;I have finished hacking into the dark computer's mainframe. The e-mail account will shut down in exactly 10 seconds. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... KABOOM!&quot; This had certainly annoyed the Dark Chao until the defenses and weapons were ready. &quot;We had to spend 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 rings for all this stuff.&quot; The Chao said. &quot;Good! Prepare to launch the attack!&quot; Gem Sonic said.<br>
<br>
Next Time: The Chao launch an all-out attack on the Dark Chao Garden, but will they win? Find out in Chapter 3: The Attack!<br>
<br>
Note: I will need some backup writers please.

Oy! I don't know how many backup writers! Anyways, I made this one all by myself! Ready? GO!<br>
<br>
One day, a Knuckles Chao named Chai was strolling around the Chao garden, until suddenly, the grey moron appears out of a bush, with new animal parts. &quot;I challenge you to a race!&quot; said the grey moron. &quot;Nah. I prefer Chao Karate more than Chao races. I won every single level in Chao Karate, including Super.&quot; said Chai. &quot;Oh, but that's not all. To the victor goes several toys. To the loser goes big rocks that will hurt the loser.&quot; said the grey moron. Then Chai perked up. &quot;Works for me!&quot; said Chai joyfully. What the grey moron didn't know was that his stats were lower than Chai's and every single stat of Chai was to 999! And what Chai didn't know was that the race was LONG!<br>
<br>
Other Chao wanted to join the race, too, but they also didn't know that the race was long. Chaclon made the deal with them. Then Chaclon thought, &quot;I'll beat their butts tomorrow morning!&quot; Then, they all went to sleep when night was there. The next morning, it was time for the long race! Omochao was there and Knuckles watched TV and guess what he saw? His favorite Knuckles Chao, Chai, entering the race! Knuckles' eyes bugged out. Then Knuckles said, &quot;He'll never win that Chao Race!&quot; But then, Knuckles realized that he raised all of Chai's stats to 9999! Knuckles cheered for Chai, and he chanted, &quot;Go Chai! Go Chai! Go Chai! Go Chai!&quot; Omochao appeared at the left of the starting line. &quot;Ladies and gentleChao! Boys and girls of all ages! This Chao year's race has Chai the Knuckles Chao and other competitors!&quot; Chai waved to everyone in the audience and the audience and Knuckles cheered! &quot;Chaclon is racing, too!&quot; Omochao said to the audience. Chaclon posed like a cute Chao. The audience cheered, while Knuckles booed at Chaclon. &quot;The baby Hero Chao named Angetix that has been given every animal and Chaos Drive once! And also a Hero Fruit!&quot; The audience cheered, while Knuckles eyes looked like puppy eyes. Then he yelled, &quot;I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THAT BABY HERO CHAO WILL EVOLVE INTO AN ANGEL CHAOS CHAO!&quot; This yel <br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm panicking at the lack of backup writers!<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Oy.  You're nowhere near the length of one chapter.  Also, perhaps you should hone your writing skills.  How old are you, anyway?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Oy! I don't know how many backup writers! Anyways, I made this one all by myself! Ready? GO!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; One day, a Knuckles Chao named Chai was strolling around the Chao garden, until suddenly, the grey moron appears out of a bush, with new animal parts. &quot;I challenge you to a race!&quot; said the grey moron. &quot;Nah. I prefer Chao Karate more than Chao races. I won every single level in Chao Karate, including Super.&quot; said Chai. &quot;Oh, but that's not all. To the victor goes several toys. To the loser goes big rocks that will hurt the loser.&quot; said the grey moron. Then Chai perked up. &quot;Works for me!&quot; said Chai joyfully. What the grey moron didn't know was that his stats were lower than Chai's and every single stat of Chai was to 999! And what Chai didn't know was that the race was LONG!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Other Chao wanted to join the race, too, but they also didn't know that the race was long. Chaclon made the deal with them. Then Chaclon thought, &quot;I'll beat their butts tomorrow morning!&quot; Then, they all went to sleep when night was there. The next morning, it was time for the long race! Omochao was there and Knuckles watched TV and guess what he saw? His favorite Knuckles Chao, Chai, entering the race! Knuckles' eyes bugged out. Then Knuckles said, &quot;He'll never win that Chao Race!&quot; But then, Knuckles realized that he raised all of Chai's stats to 9999! Knuckles cheered for Chai, and he chanted, &quot;Go Chai! Go Chai! Go Chai! Go Chai!&quot; Omochao appeared at the left of the starting line. &quot;Ladies and gentleChao! Boys and girls of all ages! This Chao year's race has Chai the Knuckles Chao and other competitors!&quot; Chai waved to everyone in the audience and the audience and Knuckles cheered! &quot;Chaclon is racing, too!&quot; Omochao said to the audience. Chaclon posed like a cute Chao. The audience cheered, while Knuckles booed at Chaclon. &quot;The baby Hero Chao named Angetix that has been given every animal and Chaos Drive once!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's a good fanfic!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gem Sonic and the Dark Chao<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chapter 1: The Dark Lord's Plot<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once every day, Dark Chao would enter Chao World, then he would ruin everything. Gem Sonic couldn't put up with him, he was just too ANNOYING! So, Sonic blew his bugle, and suddenly, all 67,000,000,000 Chao ran to him. &quot;OK guys!&quot; He called to his team. &quot;I know we have a Dark Chao whose annoying us everyday, and we just can't put up with him any longer! So, Chaos, I need you to buy Defenses and Weapons from the Black Market, and I'm sure we'll be prepared for our attack on Friday! Any questions?&quot; &quot;Sir, no sir!&quot; the Chao replied. At that time, they ran to the Black Market, searching for defenses and weapons while Sonic turned on his computer. &quot;Welcome to Gem Sonic 9.0.&quot; Sonic's computer said. He entered the request, &quot;Send_the_Sobig.F_virus.exe.&quot; Sonic's computer said, &quot;Ok, please wait.&quot; Then, a progress bar appeared saying, &quot;0% completed.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chapter 2: The Defenses and Weapons<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the progress bar said, &quot;100% completed&quot;, the computer said, &quot;I have finished hacking into the dark computer's mainframe. The e-mail account will shut down in exactly 10 seconds. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... KABOOM!&quot; This had certainly annoyed the Dark Chao until the defenses and weapons were ready. &quot;We had to spend 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 rings for all this stuff.&quot; The Chao said. &quot;Good!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm panicking at the lack of backup writers!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oy.  You're nowhere near the length of one chapter.  Also, perhaps you should hone your writing skills.  How old are you, anyway?<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Oy! I don't know how many backup writers! Anyways, I made this one all by myself! Ready? GO!<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; One day, a Knuckles Chao named Chai was strolling around the Chao garden, until suddenly, the grey moron appears out of a bush, with new animal parts. &quot;I challenge you to a race!&quot; said the grey moron. &quot;Nah. I prefer Chao Karate more than Chao races. I won every single level in Chao Karate, including Super.&quot; said Chai. &quot;Oh, but that's not all. To the victor goes several toys. To the loser goes big rocks that will hurt the loser.&quot; said the grey moron. Then Chai perked up. &quot;Works for me!&quot; said Chai joyfully.

Then Knuckles said, &quot;He'll never win that Chao Race!&quot; But then, Knuckles realized that he raised all of Chai's stats to 9999! Knuckles cheered for Chai, and he chanted, &quot;Go Chai! Go Chai! Go Chai! Go Chai!&quot; Omochao appeared at the left of the starting line. &quot;Ladies and gentleChao! Boys and girls of all ages! This Chao year's race has Chai the Knuckles Chao and other competitors!&quot; Chai waved to everyone in the audience and the audience and Knuckles cheered! &quot;Chaclon is racing, too!&quot; Omochao said to the audience. Chaclon posed like a cute Chao. The audience cheered, while Knuckles booed at Chaclon. &quot;The baby Hero Chao named Angetix that has been given every animal and Chaos Drive once! And also a Hero Fruit!&quot; The audience cheered, while Knuckles eyes looked like puppy eyes. Then he yelled, &quot;I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THAT BABY HER <br>
