The old one looked sideways at the youngster. &quot;Probably not,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I'm the only one that ever fought back. Then the evil owner tried to put me in a bowl of moving water to drown, but I bit him. He doesn't know what to do with me, but soon I will die. Everyone else is terrified. I was in the monster's lair one time with another mouse...I told him we could take it if we ganged up, but the other one was just paralyzed with fear. Couldn't move. I watched him get eaten. Horrible.&quot; <br>
<br>
The mind of the little one raced with fear trying to figure a way out of the hell he had landed in, when the cage top opened. A giant hand reached down for the older mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't give up, little one,&quot; he croaked as he was lifted by his tail. &quot;No matter how bad it seems, don't give up - that's all we can do!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then he was gone. <br>
<br>
A long time the mouse sat there and was very sad. He kept listening for the scream but there wasn't one. Then he hoped that the old warrior mouse may have killed the monster - but there was little chance of that. So he sat in fear, which he decided was worse than anything. Anything at all, even death. <br>
<br>
So, after a few days, the hand came back. And the little mouse rushed up and jumped into it. Trembling and afraid, but determined that he could save one of his family, even for a little while, and his fear would at least be over - he hated it so! His life had gone from a happy wonder to a dread hopeless mess. He had made up his mind. This was the best thing he could do. <br>
<br>
So into the lair of the monster he went. By his tail, cast roughly into the cold gravel. He tried hard not to hate humans. Not all of them could be bad. The old mouse had seen a lot, but couldn't have seen everything. <br>
<br>
He was terribly afraid, though he didn't know of what, having no real concept of death. His sight was poor, as with most mice. But he smelled death - he smelled and heard it sliding toward him. <br>
<br>
His first sight of it came as it turned around a large rock. There was no mistaking it. It was missing the wings and the legs, but it was a dragon. Plain as day - a real dragon. Its eyes glittered as it saw him. And there in its side was a wound - a long gash ripped by sharp teeth. The old mouse had gotten one last blow in after all. He had fought with his life to save the little mouse, but had lost in the end. Fear gripped the little mouse and he froze. Froze solid. He couldn't move. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't give up.&quot; said the spirit of the old mouse. <br>
<br>
The little mouse was shaken from his terror and something else took its place. Anger. Why should they suffer and die? Just mice?? That old mouse had more integrity and courage than any human or dragon the little mouse had met yet. He decided then that the dragon would not eat his family. The dragon would never eat another mouse ever again. <br>
<br>
Then he remembered that dragons breathe fire. He moved to the side with all his youthful speed, and just in time. The dragon's head blurred past him and brushed his whiskers, spinning him in circles. It hurt, but he jumped straight up and chirped in alarm. Below him, the dragon turned its great head and coiled for another blow, as the little one landed on his back. <br>
<br>
Not pausing even for a half second, he jumped in panic for the only safe place in the lair - the dragon's head!  <br>
<br>
Teeth bared, claws reaching, he felt his jaws tighten on scales - then sink in, and he wrung and flailed his entire mouse body for all he was worth. Biting and flailing, digging into the side of the dragon's neck where the old warrior had marked his target for him. Time slowed to a standstill. <br>
<br>
The dragon writhed and flung the mouse about the cage trying to dislodge him - he felt the cage walls smash into him - he felt the floor - his little bones ached and fire spread through his body - but he would not let go. He dug deeper every chance he got to widen his grip! <br>
<br>
Then, after a lifetime of battle, it was over. He woke on his side, sure he was dead, but pain proved him wrong. And the dragon was next to him, sprawled out on his back, still breathing with a rasping sound like a rusty  <br>
