The rat stopped for a moment to gaze back. He was still smiling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I've heard that myth. The Caring Human. The Kind One. Don't get your hopes up, kid. It's a fairy tale. Like the Millet Mouse, or the Sugar Rat.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Mouse Knight's heart sank. Was there no hope? He just refused to give up - he remembered his quest - and strength came back to him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Some day, Mike, maybe I will prove you wrong,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Mike chuckled. &quot;I'd love that, my little friend. I really would.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
They walked for the whole night. They talked and talked. Each instinctively liked the other. They became close in a very short time. Michael showed the mouse where to get good treats and clean water - at the back of a restaurant. They paused to talk to other rats, who glared at the mouse and made him feel uncomfortable, and a little scared. But Michael appeared to be well respected in his small corner of town, and no other rats would dare to challenge him for his walking meal. Even bigger ones. <br>
<br>
Before they knew it, they were at the tool shed. Everyone had made it. And they were stunned into awe at seeing the Mouse Knight again, much less that he had a rat with him. <br>
<br>
Being young and quite uninformed, the little mice came right to the rat, oddity that he was to them. They crawled on him and sniffed him. Michael loved it, touching noses with each one of them. <br>
<br>
A few of them questioned The Mouse Knight while Mike played with the others. <br>
<br>
&quot;How did you get away?&quot; and &quot;You are our hero!&quot; and &quot;We are hungry and thirsty!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm no hero,&quot; the little one said. &quot;I got away by luck. And we know of a place for food and water - Mike showed me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Soon, after much scurrying, they were all eating their fill behind a very fine dining establishment, and enjoying every minute of it. While they were eating, Mouseknight told Mike of his plans. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, then, we'd better set out to find this pet store of yours,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be far away. There are many in the city. We're going to need help.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And these mice need to be kept somewhere safe,&quot; Mouseknight told Mike. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, safe is an illusion, my friend, but I know a place that's close.&quot; <br>
<br>
The wee hours before dawn saw the mice and the rat skulking in the park, at the edge of civilization. There were a number of semi-abandoned buildings, and the grass was unkempt and tall. They could hide easily. Mike told them to be careful and stay close - there were loose dogs and cats in the park. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are cats!&quot; &quot;And dogs?&quot; &quot;Can I eat this grass?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Worse than dragons,&quot; Mouseknight told them, looking around nervously. &quot;And no, you better not.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mike said he'd be right back, and that they'd better wait for him there, and wander not at all. If anything bad came, hide and stay hidden until he made two quick chirps. Everyone agreed. <br>
<br>
Half an hour went by and the mice were restless. The little one had trouble containing them. Finally, he began telling them stories from the few books he'd read. He knew it wouldn't help to tone down his already ridiculous reputation, but it might keep them all still for a while. <br>
<br>
In the middle of the third story (what was taking Mike so long?), suddenly there was a noise. A scraping on the pavement near the bush they were in. They all froze, looking up past Mouseknight with horror. Slowly, wincing at what might be there, The Knight looked over his shoulder. <br>
<br>
A human! Squatting down and looking right at them, not three feet away - well within grabbing distance. He had long black hair hanging around his face, and had soft brown eyes. He smiled. <br>
<br>
The mice all chirped and ran for it, randomly. &quot;No, wait!&quot; Mouseknight yelled, but they were afraid. God knows how far they'd go or who might get lost. He felt hopeless. Stupid human! His quest was too important for this. <br>
<br>
He remembered when he was tiny, just a baby, his mother hissing and snarling at the giant hand that would come into the tank to grab mice. He had felt so protected! He knew now that his mom never stood a chance against the dreaded hand, but <br>
