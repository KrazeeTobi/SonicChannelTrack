Remember Claws the Wolverine?  Well, he's back!<br>
<br>
Claws the Wolverine: part 1<br>
<br>
A long time ago, back when many castles were still young, a wolverine lived in a creul family.  He looked a little bit like Knuckles, but he was dark purple, and had long, elf-like ears and HUGE claws on his hands.  His parents were always fighting.  This somehow made him think that fighting was the anser to everything.  Then one day, disaster struck.  The world entered the Dark Ages.  The wolverine's family couldn't care for him anymore, so they had to abandon him.  He was very scared all alone, and he was only three at the time.<br>
<br>
the next morning:<br>
<br>
A wizard was walking through town.  He needed an assistant.  This wizard was Dr. Eggman's ansestor!  He even looked like him!  When the wizard saw the wolverine, he made him his assistant.  He named the wolverine Claws.  Claws had a very hard job, and he always hated the wizard.  But, he obeyed orders anyway, because if he didn't, the wizard would beat him.  Poor Claws didn't even get paid!  The wizard had become very lazy ever since Claws was old enough to do work for him.  It was always &quot;Claws, get me this!&quot; or &quot;Claws, have you finished that potion yet?!?&quot; Then, one day, Claws made a potion like no other. &quot;At last, my greatest potion is complete!&quot; Cried the wizard..<br>
<br>
