Spyke the Silver Echidna: part four<br>
<br>
Last time: Knuckles had arived in Robotropolis.  Sonic and Tails had come to help.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you're saying that some echidna girl saved your life, Eggman captured her, and now you want us to help you save her?&quot; Said Sonic.  &quot;Yeah.  So, are we gonna get going, or are we gonna get going?&quot; Replied Knuckles.  So, they ran through Robotropolis, defeating everyone who got in their way.  Eventuly, they came to a huge tower.  It had metal bars on the windows.  &quot;Come on.  That must be where Eggman is keeping Spyke.&quot; Said Knuckles.  &quot;But what would Eggman want with a bunch of echidnas?&quot; Asked Tails.  &quot;I don't know, Tails, but we'll just have to find out.&quot; ansered Knuckles.  After a lot of looking, they found another loose piece of metal on the gate.  They were in the building.  The three heros were shocked at what they saw.  There was a huge cage holding all the silver echidnas!  All of them were sitting down, with looks on their faces that said, &quot;We're doomed.  We'll never get out of here.&quot;  All of them, that is, exept Spyke.  She was screaming, hitting the concrete walls, biting the metal bars.  &quot;Spyke!  Are you all right?!?&quot; Said Knuckles.  &quot;I'm fine.&quot; She said when she saw them.  &quot;Who are your friends?&quot;  &quot;This is Sonic.&quot; Said Knuckles, pointing to Sonic. &quot;And this is Tails.&quot;  He added, looking at Tails.  &quot;Are you guys here to get me out?&quot; Asked Spyke.  &quot;We sure are.  Do you know what Eggman wants with you?&quot; Replied Knuckles.  &quot;Well, I overheard him talking on the phone.  He said something about rare silver animals.  I think he ment us.  Then he said 'I'll bring you these animals, and you'll have those silver coats for your store.' He wants our fur!  Can you imagine anything sicker than that?!?&quot;  Cried Spyke.  &quot;Quick, hide!  I think I here him coming!&quot; She said.  Sonic rushed into a barral.  Knuckles jumped into a large bucket.  Tails flew up to the celing and held onto a lamp.  Eggman walked in.  He was in the same robot that he was in when he captured the echidnas.  He opened the cage door.  The echidnas tried to rush out.  But before they could, Eggman made the cage comeout of his robot, and he trapped the echidnas.  Then he walked off in his robot.  &quot;HELP!!!&quot;  Cried Spyke.  &quot;It's no use.&quot; laughed Eggman.  &quot;There's no one around to hear you.&quot;  &quot;There he goes.&quot;  Said Knuckles. &quot;Come on, guys!  There's no time to lose!&quot;  So, the three heros chased Eggman's robot...<br>
