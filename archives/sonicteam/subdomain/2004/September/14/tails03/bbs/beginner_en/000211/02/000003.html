Velux and the intruder were standing in Velux's office, silent. Velux decided to break the intimidating silence of the intruder-man.<br>
&quot;So tell me,&quot; Velux said, with a tone of trembling fear in his voice, &quot;W-what was it that you want me to help you with?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh yes, forgive me. I never got to that,&quot; said the unknown man, &quot;I want you and your organization to aid me in every way possible.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aid you in what?&quot; asked Velux, with a little impatience.<br>
&quot;Aid me in destroying the demigods,&quot; cooly replied the man. Velux's pupils decreased in size. He stumbled backward and nearly fell over a chair.<br>
&quot;You want to... kill Kilroy and Hippostink!?&quot; Velux said, quietly and astonished-like, &quot;But... they're the founders of this dimension! They're the whole reason NextWednesday exists!&quot; Velux was nearly shouting now.<br>
&quot;Yes, but by fluke. They've shown their incompetence plenty of times, what with the fruitless wars they waged against one another. Involving the people... saying it was 'a religious war.' They ruined Kildarhon and Hippautia, the very lands that they created. I want to rectify their mistakes.&quot; replied the man, his eyes starting to fill with anger. Velux coldn't find words to express his emotions. He didn't like the way the demigods acted when they waged those wars, either, but.... that was over 14 years ago. The demigods were behaving themselves quite nicely nowadays.<br>
&quot;Kilroy and Hippostink made a pact over a decade ago,&quot; explained Velux, &quot;They would cease attacking one another, unless it was a retaliation against the other's war-like actions. After the war, many Kildarans and Hippautians moved away from Kildarhon and Hippautia, and settled the countries of Hungaria, and Europathia, the one we're in presently. Also, after the war, Kildarhon and Hippautia improved economically and spiritually. People were drawn to the demigods, because they needed help fina----&quot; <br>
&quot;There's been a retalliation.&quot; interrupted the man. Velux's heart nearly stopped. A retalliation? He did not want to see another Kildaran and Hippautian war.<br>
&quot;I.... I understand now,&quot; Velux said, rather off-in-the-distance-like, &quot;If it means preventing another war, I'll help you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Good. We set out towards Hungaria tomorrow. There is another who can help.&quot;<br>
