Then, after a lifetime of battle, it was over. He woke on his side, sure he was dead, but pain proved him wrong. And the dragon was next to him, sprawled out on his back, still breathing with a rasping sound like a rusty wheel. <br>
<br>
The little mouse slowly crawled to his feet and stood there, stunned. His senses came back and he limped over to the head of the dragon. It was dying. He almost felt sorry for it. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are a most unusual mouse,&quot; said the dragon. &quot;So very fast.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Fear. So very afraid and angry,&quot; said the mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Brave,&quot; said the dragon. &quot;So very brave. Never had a meal attack me first.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Life was such a depressing surprise,&quot; said the mouse. &quot;I expected it to be better.&quot; <br>
<br>
The dragon heaved and blood ran past the mouse's feet, staining them red. &quot;With a spirit like yours, it could be better,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
&quot;I just did what the knights would have done,&quot; said the mouse. &quot;I didn't know what else to do besides being afraid, and that never worked.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What is a knight?&quot; The dragon asked. The little mouse was surprised that the dragon didn't know. So he sat down by the monster and told him the story of Saint George. By the time he was done the dragon was almost gone. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are like Saint George,&quot; said the dragon. &quot;You are a knight.&quot; <br>
<br>
The little mouse looked down. &quot;I can't be. It takes a king to make a knight.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The first part of my name is King,&quot; said the dragon. &quot;What is your name?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't have one,&quot; said the mouse. &quot;I've heard legends that the only mice that have names are the ones loved by good people.&quot; The mouse paused, then looked at the giant's eye. &quot;Are there good people, mister dragon?&quot; <br>
<br>
The dragon smiled weakly. &quot;Yes, little mouse. There are. Somewhere. You will have to find them. Only a knight could do that. Would you like to be a knight? Do you have it in you to do good deeds and never be afraid? I think you do.&quot; <br>
<br>
The mouse nodded. He dearly would so love to be a knight! Was the dragon really a king? <br>
<br>
The dragon extended his tongue and touched the little mouse on the head. &quot;To the only mouse who ever beat a snake,&quot; it said. &quot;I dub thee MouseKnight, until you have a proper name. And if anyone asks you who made you a knight, tell them it was KingSnake.&quot; <br>
<br>
The mouse nodded, then remembered his family. <br>
<br>
&quot;What will happen to my family?&quot; he asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;They will be flushed down the toilet,&quot; KingSnake said. &quot;Unless you all escape. The cage roof is loose - the human doesn't think mice can lift it.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We can't!&quot; said the mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not one by one. But in great numbers, you are very strong. Once there were two mice in here... and one was a good fighter. I was afraid. Two might have taken me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You were afraid?&quot; the mouse gasped. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, especially of that angry mouse... he didn't taste very good anyway...and had he not made a hole in my armor, you might not have beaten me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;He was my friend,&quot; the little one whispered. <br>
<br>
&quot;He is avenged, MouseKnight.&quot; <br>
<br>
Then with a last rush of strength, the dragon whipped his tail into the air, and dislodged the roof, creating a way out. &quot;Go now, Honorable Knight. Go and free your family. Good luck. All caged animals wish for freedom.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Or a loving owner,&quot; the mouse said. <br>
<br>
&quot;That would be the only thing better,&quot; said the dragon, and then he died. <br>
<br>
Then, after a drink of water, the mouse found that it could leap straight up - very high - and get out.<br>
