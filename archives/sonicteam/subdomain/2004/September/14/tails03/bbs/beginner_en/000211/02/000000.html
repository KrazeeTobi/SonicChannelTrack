A slightly mutated creature was sitting in a cage in the boardroom of PERSON Inc.<br>
&quot;What is it, sir?&quot; asked Opus, one of the PERSON Inc. officials.<br>
&quot;I found it laying on the ground in another dimension, Opus.&quot; replied Velux, the president of PERSON Inc. and head scientist of PERSON Inc. LABS. Everyone at the meeting chuckled at this remark, because they all remembered what a fiasco the inter-dimensional warping project was.<br>
&quot;No, seriously. This is the latest result of our status enhancer drug. The statistical results: strength increased 62%; agility increased 49%; mental capabilities increased 63%; and defense increased 32%. These are not bad results, if you exclude the hideous mutations and bursts of rage,&quot; Velux said, pointing at the creature in the cage, who was vicously thrusting its arms toward various boardmembers, &quot;I expect the LABS team will soon rectify these iniquities, seeing as how I'm the head scientist. And now, I hand over the spotlight to Gustus...&quot;<br>
<br>
Far away, on a cliff somewhere, Kelthet and his cult were having a meeting of their own... a legion of figures in blue and green (with a bit of yellow) hooded cloaks were staring down at the ground and chanting something a bit off. Kelthet, with his iron casted face with a mouth that looked something like an Octorok (copyright of Nintendo), was slowly strolling toward one of the members. <br>
&quot;Does lord Kelthet wish something of me?&quot; asked the member, as Kelthet loomed over him. Kelthet stood there for a second, silent. Then, a short-medium length blade shot out of his left sleeve (still attached to his arm). He swung the blade to his left, slaughtering the member.<br>
&quot;Let this be a reminder that I have the power in this cult,&quot; said Kelthet, softly and indifferent. He did this on occasion to remind his members of just how much power he had. And, also, of what he could do with that power.<br>
