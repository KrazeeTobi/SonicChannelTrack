Some started right off - others were too afraid. &quot;You're crazy!&quot; &quot;That's right past the human - he'll squash us!&quot; &quot;Eeek!&quot; The little mouse gave them incentive by dashing out into the open himself. Heart racing, he wasn't sure he knew what he was doing, but it was the only thing to do, so he went as fast as his little legs carried him. When he looked back, the others were following. <br>
<br>
As soon as the human noticed small furry things dashing all around him, he let out a shriek that would have made any girl proud. The mice commented as they fled. &quot;Why do they always do that!&quot; &quot;I don't know - but it's funny!&quot; <br>
<br>
Then his attention went to the two cages. One empty, the other sort of. <br>
<br>
The Mouse Knight turned to watch as the others passed him up making for the open door. The first of them were already squeezing through, or under, and flying off the stairs to freedom. <br>
<br>
The human's face twisted and he yelled - a horribly loud, ugly noise to such sensitive ears - and then turned his face right to our hero, who was the only mouse sitting still in the middle of the room while the others blurred by.  <br>
<br>
&quot;oops,&quot; said the Mouse Knight, and turned tail for the door. <br>
<br>
He would have been the last out the door, but a giant foot crashed down before him, blocking his way. He tried to go over it, and he was pinned down by two big, clumsy hands. They knocked the wind from him and bent him all around in unnatural positions (good thing young mice are flexible, he thought). Finally, the human had him by the tail. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, what's up with the tail all the time!&quot; he shrieked, but the human heard nothing. He tried biting the hand. The human yelped, and cursed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn rodent!&quot; he boomed. &quot;Kill my snake will you??!&quot; <br>
<br>
Gripping the little mouse too tightly, the human rushed down the hall. The last the mouse saw of the others, they were all clear of the door except one. A very small mouse, much younger than he, was yelling that he was their hero. That they loved him. <br>
<br>
Hero? He had seen only the first part of his goal done, he thought. There was so much more to do. He had to - <br>
<br>
SPLASH! He was in water! He scrambled for the shore, but it was made of slick white hard stuff, all around. And it smelled bad. He began to panic, but didn't have time. The water was sucked down, down, into a tunnel below him - and he went with it. The human laughed as he flushed the mouse down the toilet. <br>
<br>
At least the others made it, he thought. Then it was very dark and cold as the current took him.<br>
<br>
