Mouse Knight: part five<br>
<br>
It was a giant underground labyrinth. So huge, the Mouseknight could not begin to guess how many miles. Surely a mouse could wander it and never see it all in one lifetime. <br>
<br>
His party and he were escorted deep into the cold, dark mystery for hours before they came to the magnificent central chamber. It was heated, and smelled of food and many mice. Indeed, there were more than a hundred mice present, all engaged in various forms of being mice. There was water in the corner, and guardian mice all around an old figure at the end of the room, sitting on a pillow amongst a bundled up blanket. <br>
<br>
His escort lead them through the horde of mice, which stopped as he went by and stared in silence. A few tails rattled, but mostly they just stared in awe. When they reached the end of the room, Mouseknight saw that the figure on the pillow, he knew that the mouse was ancient indeed - far moreso than the old fighter who had dueled the dragon before. The little mouse just stared back at the old, blind mouse on the pillow. He didn't know what to do. <br>
<br>
The silence in the vast room was broken by a mouse to the right side of the old mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;You stand before his eminence, King Arnold the First, King of Mouse City and ruler of the Nest.&quot; <br>
<br>
All of Mouseknight's family and new friends OOOooed and AAHHhhhed. <br>
<br>
The guard went on, &quot;Your majesty, we have brought you the Mouseknight as requested by the rat.&quot; <br>
<br>
Not that they didn't see him before, but now all mouse eyes went to Mike, who was a bit nervous. Teeth were gnashed and eyes squinted down at him. Tails rattled and mice crept toward him low and hostile. &quot;Get the rat!&quot; &quot;Eat the rat!&quot; &quot;Vengeance!&quot; &quot;Came to the wrong place, rat!&quot; <br>
<br>
They were almost on him and he was prepared to sell his life at a dear price to these little midgets. But the Mouseknight intervened. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stop!&quot; he yelled, running out in front of Mike. The mice recoiled. What was this? A mouse standing up for a rat? But they did stop. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is this your friend, Mouse Knight?&quot; asked the king. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, my liege,&quot; The little mouse said. &quot;And I won't let anyone harm him, even if it means we have to leave this great kingdom, or... my life, if it comes to that.&quot; <br>
<br>
Silence. Then, finally, the king said, &quot;I understand you aren't killable anyway, Sir Mouse Knight. And it appears that you have studied your courtly manners - very rare in mice. So it appears we must bestow your companion with the title of MouseFriend.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mike smiled nervously. All the little family of Mouseknight came and crowded around Mike, nudging him and licking him. <br>
<br>
Some mouse in the crowd, a really big mouse - and fat, too, said, &quot;Who says this guy is a Knight? You didn't make him a knight, my lord! Who did?&quot; <br>
<br>
Everyone looked at Mouseknight as he stood up tall (which wasn't very) and said, &quot;KingSnake made me a Mouse Knight.&quot; <br>
<br>
The crowd broke out in whispers and gasps of breath, as the king's old eyes got wide for a moment as if he were shocked and could still see. <br>
<br>
The fat huge mouse snaffed and wiped his nose at Mouseknight anyway. But he no longer looked interested in a fight. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that's better than me doing it,&quot; the King said. &quot;We had reservations about this mysterious mouse who fought snakes and humans and rescued our kind, but here you are. Most astonishing.&quot; <br>
<br>
At that, the king slowly crept, inch by inch, down from his pillow and sniffed Mouseknight out of the crowd, and finally reaching him, laid his paw on the small mouse. &quot;You have done well,&quot; he said. And smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you really a named mouse?&quot; asked the Mouseknight. It was probably improper, but he had to know. <br>
<br>
The king smiled. &quot;Yes, little one. I was loved and named by my human, who passed away before I did. You may call me Arnie, as he did.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then you know what it is to be loved,&quot; the Mouseknight whispered. And although the old mouse was blind, his hearing was quite good. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is nothing better,&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing better than being held and petted. Fed anything your heart desires and sleeping in warmth. Being kissed and told you are special. It is heaven to us.&quot;
