Kerchak, Zimbarii, and Vixanie stopped walking. Kerchak whispered to Zimbarii. &quot;Zimbarii, there are a lot of first timers here. Make sure they understand.&quot; Zimbarii nodded, ten said, for everyone to hear, &quot;If this is your first crossing, listen up! There is no water until we get to the other side of that hill.&quot; He pointed a to a large hill, many miles from us. &quot;And you'd better keep up, because if a predator catches you, you're on your own. Move out!&quot; We all started walking again. &quot;Oh...&quot; Said Dante. &quot;It looks like a very long walk.&quot; &quot;Hot too!&quot; Said Atri. &quot;If Dante, Gonu, Zephyr, aniyu and Kaya smell something burning, it might be Atri!&quot;<br>
<br>
a few days later...<br>
<br>
We were much closer to the hill. Kerchak and Zimbarii started roaring happily, and advanced toward the hill. &quot;The lake!&quot; Cried Aniyu happily. &quot;We made it?&quot; I asked. &quot;It's just over that hill!&quot; Replied Aniyu. &quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Said Kaya. Since Dante, Gonu, Atri and I were faster, we went over the hill first. But instead of a lake, we saw a dried-up wasteland. There were some dragon bones in there. Kaya walked over the hill too. &quot;Wh-Where's the lake?&quot; she asked. Aniyu walked over the hill, and also saw the wasteland. &quot;B-But...&quot; She stammered. &quot;But we always had water before...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kerchak looked at the dried up lake, then turned and said, &quot;The pastures are only a few days away. Keep moving!&quot; Vixanie ran after him and said, &quot;But Kerchak! We've never gone this far without water! If we keep going like this we'll lose half the herd!&quot; Kerchak turned and said, &quot;Then we save the half that deserves to live.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aniyu hadn't moved a bit. She was still sitting in the middle of the dried lake. &quot;We always had water...&quot; she whimpered. &quot;We always had water here before... We always had water here, always... And now, there isn't even mud...&quot; Kaya walked over to Aniyu, her large feet crushing the hard ground. &quot;There is no water here, Aniyu.&quot; I had ran over next to Aniyu, when I ntoiced how Kaya's foot was crushing the dry ground. &quot;Kaya!&quot; I said. &quot;Don't move!&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; Asked Kaya. &quot;What's wrong?&quot; &quot;Guys!&quot; I shouted. &quot;Dante, Gonu, Atri! Come over here!&quot; They all came flying over. &quot;Guys. listen.&quot; I could hear something gurgling under the ground. &quot;I hear it!&quot; Said Dante. &quot;So do I!&quot; Said Gonu. &quot;Atri hears too!&quot; &quot;Lift your foot, Kaya!&quot; I said. Kaya did so. We all started digging in the ground, which was very soft and moist. &quot;Now press down.&quot; I said. As soon as Kaya pressed her foot into the ground, water appeared! We all roared loudly. &quot;Water! Over here!&quot; I shouted.<br>
<br>
We all took long drinks, until Kerchak showed up. He pushed us all away and took the water hole for himself. We decided to stay a while, and get a few drinks.<br>
