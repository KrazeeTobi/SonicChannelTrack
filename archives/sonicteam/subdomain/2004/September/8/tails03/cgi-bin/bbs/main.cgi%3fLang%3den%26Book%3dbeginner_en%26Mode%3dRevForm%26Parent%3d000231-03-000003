<TEXTAREA NAME="Text" COLS="60" ROWS="6" WRAP="VIRTUAL">  &quot;Listen, I only said that to get your attention. Now then, about your dislike of the giraffes...&quot;
   &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; they said simultaneously, resuming their activity.
   &quot;Get off!&quot;
   &quot;Looking for the perfect gift? Try looking in a dumpster.&quot;
   &quot;YOUR COUSIN WATCHES EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION!!!&quot; Swazi shouted in revived desperation. They receased their activities and restared at him rereproachfully.
   &quot;Were you shouting that to get our attention as well?&quot; the escapee retorted flatly.
   &quot;Rebellion! Rebellion! Rebellion! Giraffes! Mr. Cheese! Trash can! Three years!&quot; He shouted insanely, flailing his arms about uselessly. The escapee looked up at Quack, still steadfastly anchoring him down by the ankle.
   &quot;Did you get any of that?&quot; he asked him doubtfully.
   &quot;No.&quot; was his reply.
   &quot;Neither did I. It just sort of went underneath the neck, if you know what I'm saying.&quot;
   &quot;Will you idiots form a rebellion with me? Please? I've been needing one for the past three years, in which I have spent the time gnawing on old tires in a trash can.&quot; The two of them considered this thoughtfully, or at least, one of them did. Indeed, they were idiots, and indeed, they could tell that he had been in a trash can gnawing on tires for three years. What the heck?
   &quot;Certainly, lad. I'd be glad to rebel. What exactly are we rebelling against?&quot;
   &quot;Mr. Cheese and his dominion of giraffes.&quot; More thoughtful/less consideration.
   &quot;Certainly, lad. I'd be glad to rebel. What exactly are we rebelling against?&quot; Quack repeated, not entirely certain he had heard the reply correctly. Swazi shook his head.
   &quot;Who are you?&quot;
   &quot;Allow me to introduce myself. I am Quarkle Urkin Arklin Carmen Kaiser.&quot; he said suavely, extending his hand. Swazi stared benightedly at the hand.
   &quot;Right, but who are you?&quot;
   &quot;Ahem, well. Yes. Just... Just call me Quack, all right?&quot;
   &quot;Most people don't realize something is missing, or rather, being ignored, until it is brought to their attention.&quot; stated the escapee matter-of-factly.
   &quot;I guess you can come, too,&quot; Swazi sighed, staring down at Quack's ankle, &quot;I see you've already made a friend.&quot;
   &quot;I believe he is amorously infatuated with my ankle.&quot; said Quack.
   &quot;And what shall I address you by, O one who cuts off the circulation to ankles?&quot;
   &quot;Thank you kindly, Gifford, but I'm allergic to shellfish.&quot;
   &quot;Er, right. We'll call you Rocklobster.
   &quot;My name's Swazi. Swazi Land.&quot;
   &quot;What shall we call our little force?&quot; Quack inquired, &quot;We need a hearty name. One that can be remembered. One that will state our cause, whatever that may be... One that says 'Hey! We're rebels! Get me a sandwich!'&quot;
   &quot;How about 'Fred'?&quot; suggested Rocklobster.
   &quot;No. Not that sort of name.&quot; replied Quack.
   &quot;Harold?&quot;
   &quot;Uhh... I meant more along the lines of a concept or organization, not a person.&quot; 
   &quot;Wal-mart?&quot;
   &quot;That's already been taken. We need to compose one.&quot;
   &quot;McFredward's House of European Tacos?&quot;
   &quot;All right, now you're just being stupid. Think more about concepts and stop, well, being stupid.&quot;
   &quot;How about 'Tax'? Taxes are concepts.&quot;
   &quot;If I may interject... SwaziLand.&quot; interjected Swazi.
   &quot;Do what now?&quot; do-whated Quack.
   &quot;SwaziLand!&quot;
   &quot;Swaziland doesn't exist anymore. It was dissolved with all the other countries.&quot;
   &quot;No. No. I meant that as a name. SwaziLand. It's a combination of my first and last name. How's that? Eh? Eh? I think it fits, seeing as how I organized this rebellion.&quot;
   &quot;Hmmm...&quot; hmmm-ed Quack, &quot;You have a point there, Mr. Land. I was sort of leaning towards Tax, but SwaziLand works, too.&quot;
   &quot;And what about you?&quot; asked Swazi, looking down at Rocklobster, who was now sucking on Quack's ankle, &quot;What do you think of the name SwaziLand?&quot;
   &quot;I don't think, Gifford. I don't think.&quot;
   &quot;Then it's settled. We are now the SwaziLand Anti-Cheese 'n Giraffe Battalion Legion Force Resistance Movement. SwaziLand, for short.&quot;</TEXTAREA></TD>
