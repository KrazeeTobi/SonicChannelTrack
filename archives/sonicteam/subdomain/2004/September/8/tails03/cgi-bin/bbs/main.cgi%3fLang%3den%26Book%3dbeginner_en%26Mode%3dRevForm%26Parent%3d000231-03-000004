<TEXTAREA NAME="Text" COLS="60" ROWS="6" WRAP="VIRTUAL">And so the beginning of the rebellion was formed. In celebration, the three ran to the nearest roadside, hijacked a jeep as it was driving by, tossed the driver into a lake, spray-painted the phrase &quot;Giraffes have long necks&quot; on the exterior wall of a footwear store and later threw large rocks at that same store's windows.

   Swazi spent hours upon hours during the night erecting a three-second, crudely crafted, yet still legible, incomprehensibly unambiguous and attention drawing sign that read &quot;SWAZILAND HEADQUARTERS&quot; in the park. He had chosen the location of their resistance movement's headquarters and, ironically, it was centered around the trash can he loathed so much.
   &quot;All right. Our first tactical meeting,&quot; stated Swazi, as he headed towards the podium, which was actually the trash can, &quot;All in favor, say 'aye'.&quot; Quack stared benightedly at him.
   &quot;Er...?&quot; began Quack.
   &quot;No, 'aye'.&quot; corrected Swazi.
   &quot;Uhh...&quot;
   &quot;'Aye'&quot;
   &quot;Wha?&quot;
   &quot;'AYE!!'&quot;
   &quot;What about my eye?&quot;
   &quot;It's about to be gouged out, if you don't get it right!&quot;
   &quot;Get what right?&quot;
   &quot;Aye.&quot;
   &quot;Yes. I have two of those.&quot;
   &quot;Aye. Not eye.&quot;
   &quot;You're speaking in riddles.&quot;
   &quot;ARGHH!!!&quot;
   &quot;You haven't proposed anything yet, Gifford.&quot; honked Rocklobster. Swazi's face reddened.
   &quot;Oh, uh, right. I say, we rebel against the giraffes! All in favor, say 'aye'!&quot;
   &quot;We already decided on that, Gifford. We already decided on that.&quot;
   &quot;All in favor of saying aye, say 'aye'.&quot;
   No response.
   &quot;All in favor of saying aye, say 'aye'!&quot;
   Still no response.
   &quot;Say aye, you miserable misbegotten insects! Say aye!!&quot;
   &quot;We're not in favor, Gifford.&quot; Rocklobster pointed out.
   &quot;Well, I want a joyous chorus of 'ayes' to burst forth and toss me backward, so, all- regardless of whether or not you're in favor- say 'aye'!&quot; Rocklobster yelled 'toothpick' and Quack, still benighted, produced a pathetic excuse of an attempt to say 'aye.'
   &quot;Ah... Oh.. Hrrm...&quot; mumbled Swazi, stunned by what he just realized, &quot;I'm stunned. You know what I just realized? It hit me like a ton of potato shavings.&quot; He sighed and turned his back to his rather confused and dwindling audience. &quot;There's only three members of SwaziLand. Only three members. It couldn't be four, it couldn't be two. Three. I hate the number three! It's so... Three-like!&quot;
   &quot;Not to mention that we're far outnumbered by the giraffes.&quot; stated Quack, as his mind dipped itself in apprehension and snapped his being back to reality. &quot;To rectify this dilemma, I propose we gather more members.&quot;
   &quot;Wonderful! Brilliant! Suave! Why didn't I think of that?&quot; He shot them a dark look. &quot;Don't answer that.
  &quot;All in favor, say 'aye'.&quot;
   &quot;Aye.&quot;
   &quot;Ham sandwich.&quot;
   &quot;Close enough. So, we're off to gather more members, are we? This'll prove interesting. And non-three-like.&quot;
   And so they left their base of operations completely obvious and open to attack to gather more members.

   &quot;Sir, do you see this receipt?&quot; barked Llama furiously, waving a &quot;Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff&quot; receipt wildly in the air.
   &quot;I could if you'd stop wavin' it around like some deranged howler monkey!&quot; retorted the cashier, snatching the Frothy Octopi 'n Stuff receipt from Llama's hand. He read through it once. &quot;So what's the problem?&quot; he inquired.
   &quot;What's the problem? What's the problem!? Sir, I suggest you take a good look at that receipt.&quot; barked Llama. The cashier studied it with such ferocity that his eyes nearly caused the receipt to burst into flames.
   &quot;All right, now, what's the problem?&quot; he asked again. Llama banged his hands down upon the countertop.
   &quot;You can't even see it? And it's your job to do stuff like this? How much do they pay you here?&quot;
   &quot;$5.00 an hour.&quot;
   &quot;Well, they should pay you minimum wage! (How much is that, anyway?)&quot;
   &quot;$5.00 an hour.&quot; 
   &quot;Well, anyway, about the receipt! Do you not see that it is all horribly wrong?&quot;
   &quot;That's very fascinating, but do you want fries or tater tots?&quot;
   &quot;What?&quot;</TEXTAREA></TD>
