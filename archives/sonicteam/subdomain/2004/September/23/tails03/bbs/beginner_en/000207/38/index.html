It's a new song. Here goes... Hrrrrrm! *clears throat*<br>
<br>
Trigger happy! Trigger happy! Got an AK-47 well ya know it makes me feel all right. Got an oozy by my pillow and it helps me sleep better at night. There's no feeling any greater than to, shoot first and ask questions later. Now I'm Trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Better watch out punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away! Well ya can't take my guns away, I got a constitutional right! Yeah, I gotta be ready if the commies attack us tonight! I'll blow their brains out with my Smith &amp; Wesson, that'll teach 'em a darn good lesson. now. I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Oh, I accidently shot daddy last night in the den! I mistook him in the dark for a drug-crazed Nazi again! Now why'd you have to get so mad? It was just a lousy flesh wound, dad! Ya know I'm Trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Better watch out punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away! Well I still haven't figured out the safety of my rifle yet. Little Fluffy took a round, better take him to the vet. I filled that kitty cat so full of led, we'll have to use him for a pencil instead 'cause I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Trigger happy, happy every day! Come on and grab your ammo! What do you have to lose? We'll get all liquored up and shoot at anything that moves! I got a brand new semi-automatic weapon with a lasersight! Shoot to kill now. Shoot to kill. Yeah, I'm praying somebody's gonna break in here tonight! Shoot to kill now. Shoot to kill. I always keep a Magnum in my trunk so ask yourself if you feel lucky, punk 'cause I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day! Trigger happy, trigger happy every day!<br>
<br>
There's another one! You'll love this! It's called: The Night Santa Went Crazy.<br>
<br>
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys, for the good gentile girls, and the good gentile boys, when their boss busted in, and he scared 'em half to death, he had a rifle in his hands, and cheap whiskie on his breath.<br>
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo like a big fat drunk disgruntled yuletide rambo. He smiled back and said, with a twinkle in his eye: &quot;Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die! The night Santa went crazy, the night St. Nick went insane. Realized he'd been gettin' the wrong deal, somethin' must've finally snapped in his brain. Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it. Everywhere, you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet. He tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage and he grounded poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage! He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German lougar and he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Crougar. He picked up a flamethrower and he barbequed Blitzen. He took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken! The night Santa went crazy, the night Kris Kringle went nuts. Now ya can hardly walk around the North Pole without stepping in reindeer guts. There's no national guard in the FBI. There's a bad room behind witness something, and something searching round in the skies. The bullets kept flyin', the body kept risin' and everyone's dyin' to know, why Santa, why? my my my my my my. He used to be such a jolly guy. West Virginia. Now Santa's doin' time in a federal prison for his infamous crime. Hey, little friend now, don't you cry no more tears, he'll be out with good behavior in 700 more years! And now Dixen's in therapy, and Dodger's still nervous! And the elves all got jobs workin' for the postal service. And the same Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night, with a lawyer neggociating the movie rights. Think about the night Santa went crazy, the night St. Nick something something. Broke his back for some melted cookies. But it sounded to me that he was tired of getting gipped.
