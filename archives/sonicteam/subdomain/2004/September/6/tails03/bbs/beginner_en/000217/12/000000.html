Sorry it took so long to write. Writer's block...<br>
<br>
Dante, Gonu, Atri and I lived together happily for a while. There were many others like us where we lived. But one night, something happened.<br>
<br>
We were sitting outside on the grass, looking at the moon and stars. Suddenly, some small comets shot through the sky. We watched them in amazment. It was a huge meteor shower!<br>
<br>
After a while, it stopped. Or so we thought. We watched the stars some more. Suddenly, the sky brightened, as a giagantic asteroid fell down from the sky. It landed a few miles away from us. At first, we felt nothing. Then the shock waves hit us, knocking us to the ground. &quot;Come on!&quot; Cried Dante. &quot;We have to get out of here!&quot; Shouted Gonu. &quot;Atri is scared! Atri wants to go home!&quot; Screamed Atri. We flew away as fast as we could, because more meteors were falling.<br>
<br>
they got closer ad closer to us. We flew away, over the ocean. We flew to a neiboring island to hide until the meteor shower was over.<br>
<br>
When we got to the island, we looked back at our former home. It was no longer green, but black. The meteors had destroyed every living thing. We cried our family call, to see if anyone would hear us. (we use the family call to contact other Draikons) There was no reply. We tried again, louder this time. Still nothing. Tears came to Atri's eyes. Dante hugged her. &quot;Oh, Atri...&quot; He said soothingly. &quot;Easy, now.&quot; &quot;They're... they're all... gone...&quot; Whimpered Atri. &quot;Come on.&quot; Said Gonu. &quot;We can't stay here.&quot; so we set off to find a new home.<br>
<br>
to be continued.
