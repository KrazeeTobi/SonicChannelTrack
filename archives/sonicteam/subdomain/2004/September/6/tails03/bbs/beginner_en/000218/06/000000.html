Mouse Knight: part 1<br>
<br>
Once upon a time there was a small white mouse, born with a litter of Small mice, in a small home where the people did not expect it. The people had taken pity in a pet store upon a single sick, struggling mouse because she could not get to the food through the other mice, who were bullying her. So they bought her, thinking she would die anyway, but at least in peace, and they bought her a friend (whom they had no idea was a boy) so she might not die alone. For they had no clue how to treat sick mice. <br>
<br>
But upon coming home, the mouse got well, and before long, had her first litter there in the little cage on the kitchen table. <br>
<br>
At first the owners were thrilled, but they soon realized this was too many mice - and they didn't know what to do. So, like so many mice, they were given back to the pet store by the unthinking owners. <br>
<br>
Of course, the mice didn't know what was going on - they lived in their tiny world, knowing only their momma and dad. When they were taken back to the pet store, they were put back in with the large, dirty population again, and certainly were unhappy. <br>
<br>
The cage was overcrowded, and always smelled. They didn't get good food, and were never held (the babies had only been held lovingly three times, but each of them remembered it as their fondest memory besides being licked by mom). And many of the mice were mean. Dad was beat up, and many of the little ones were chased, bitten and bullied. Mom got sick again and soon went away, never to return. And each day, there were less mice in the cage. <br>
<br>
Now, before you give up on this story as just another one of those sad traumatic mouse stories, read on, and have faith. Every great hero has it hard at some point. (Otherwise, what would make them great?) <br>
<br>
So the little mice, new to the world, were scared and hungry. Before long dad vanished when they heard the big people say &quot;one large mouse, please,&quot; and he too never returned. They were small, and on their own. <br>
<br>
Most of the mice played with the other mice and ran on the wheel (when there was one). But one little mouse loved to perch on the hiding log and read over the shoulder of the pet store manager when he took his breaks. He read about Medieval times and the Knights of the Round Table. The mouse loved it. Each day he would look forward to the big person sitting down and reading his book. And the mouse would sit and read with him. He read only a few books with the manager before he and many of his cage mates were sold and taken away. <br>
<br>
In a dark box the little mouse and thirteen of the others were bumped along. Several of the thirteen were his immediate family - brothers and sisters. They were scared. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be scared,&quot; he told them. &quot;We're probably going to wherever mom and dad went, and they will be there to play with us again, and lick us and keep us warm.&quot; <br>
<br>
But the others were silent, and afraid. The little mouse had to admit he was a bit scared, too. But he couldn't do anything. He was just a mouse. That's what they all said. All the time. Big people even said it. They were just mice. Not worth anything. Ninety-nine cents, however much that was. <br>
<br>
So they went. Scared and quiet. <br>
<br>
Little did they know they were going to a terrible fate.<br>
<br>
to be continued.
