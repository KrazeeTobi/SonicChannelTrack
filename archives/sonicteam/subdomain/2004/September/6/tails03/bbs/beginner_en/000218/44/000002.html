Mouseknight looked back at Mike, who was frowning and looking at the floor. But he looked up when he saw Mouseknight and his face was expressionless again. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is this very thing I seek,&quot; said the little mouse excitedly. &quot;I seek to find the kind human.&quot; <br>
<br>
Gasps filled the room. The king offered the Mouseknight a piece of corn. Mouseknight took it gratefully and began to gobble it up, which started a chain reaction, and soon everyone was feasting while the meeting had not yet ended. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Mouse Knight has a holy quest!&quot; yelled the King. <br>
<br>
&quot;Huzzah!&quot; All the mice answered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is he a worthy mouse?&quot; the king bellowed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Huzzah!&quot; they answered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Then we will help him.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Huzzah, Huzzah!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Say your holy quest, Knight, and I shall name you a Saint of the Mouse People, and your quest shall be heard by the Mouse God,&quot; stated the king. <br>
<br>
Everyone stopped eating except for a tiny little mouse with huge ears. In the almost silence, Mouseknight stood up (like he remembered they did at the Round Table!) and raised his piece of corn, and said... <br>
<br>
&quot;My Quest... It is to see Mice everywhere freed from oppression and cruelty, to show them that being a mouse is a beautiful gift, and to find the kind human of myth, so that he will care for us all to the end of our days! I swear upon my title, since I have no name, that I will do this thing, or perish trying!&quot; <br>
<br>
The room burst into cheers and hops. The king nodded his head in a deeply satisfied manner, and whispered &quot;Huzzah.&quot; The little mouse had dropped the pea he was chewing on and stood stock-still on his back legs, gaping at the Mouseknight as if he had just seen a legend for the first time. <br>
<br>
Many mice came to lick the Mouseknight clean and to groom him. They even groomed Mike. Everyone agreed that his quest was a righteous one, and that Saint Mouse could achieve it, if anyone could. <br>
<br>
After the meal, everyone settled down again. The king crawled ever so slowly back onto his pillow. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is only one rumor of a kind human,&quot; he said. &quot;But he lives very, very far - out beyond the human city, in the fields of fate. Past the great barrier of moving mountains, and farther than any mouse has traveled. It is a risky and dangerous venture at best. There are monsters day and night, which will seek your hide, and the humans care nothing for us. And there are hawks.&quot; <br>
<br>
Everyone shivered visibly at the mention of the name. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what that is,&quot; said the knight, &quot;but I have to try. I will accept this burden, though I do not know the way.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You are brave, as the stories claim,&quot; said the king. &quot;Will you be going right away?&quot; <br>
<br>
The Mouseknight looked down, thinking - then lifted his head. &quot;No. I need to free my family from the pet store.&quot; <br>
<br>
More gasps filled the room. (Mice are deeply into gossip and anything exciting, and this beat anything to ever happen in Mouseville.) <br>
<br>
The king's old eyes widened for the second time. &quot;Indeed?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mouseknight resolutely. &quot;I cannot leave them. My team and I are going back to attempt a rescue!&quot; <br>
<br>
The Mouseknight's &quot;team&quot; of his rescued family and friends looked at each other like, &quot;Who... US?!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You'll need more help than that,&quot; said the king. &quot;My bravest are at your disposal. Volunteers only.&quot; At that, seven large and strong mice stepped forward, willing to follow the Mouseknight into terrible danger. <br>
<br>
But one of the little mice, a brother of the Mouseknight, inched close to his hero and whispered, &quot;Excuse me, Sir, but... but we're all cowards, remember?&quot; <br>
<br>
The little mouse looked at his bigger brother and laughed. &quot;Not any more,&quot; he squeaked. &quot;Now you're going to be heroes.&quot; <br>
<br>
The brother's head perked up and his ears became stiff. Heroes! They all looked at one another. Yeah... Heroes! They began hopping about and rattling their tails. They were sold.<br>
