Mouse Knight: part 2<br>
<br>
The little one and the others were dropped roughly into a ten gallon tank with some other mice. Many of them looked haggard and thin. They hadn't eaten. Immediately, the other mice began introducing themselves. One mouse, bigger and older, just stood in the corner. That intrigued our hero, so the little mouse went over to the old mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hi.&quot; Said the little mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;Goodbye,&quot; said the older mouse. And for awhile he said nothing more. So the little mouse groomed him, and kept him company, and at night it was cold, so he slept by the older mouse. One day, in the middle of their night, the cage opened and one of them was taken out - it was one of the little one's brothers. Everyone watched him lifted up by his tail and vanish. The little mouse was happy for his brother - he would get to see mom and dad first.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you smiling at?&quot; Said the old mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;He gets to see mommy and daddy first,&quot; said the little mouse. &quot;I wish it was me.&quot; <br>
<br>
The old mouse shifted uncomfortably and snaffed in the little one's direction. &quot;Is that what you think? You're quite naive.&quot; <br>
<br>
The little mouse was taken aback. He put his nose close to the old one to listen more. <br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone is here to feed the monster.&quot; The old one said. &quot;We are all doomed.&quot; <br>
<br>
Scared at last, the little one shook and trembled. &quot;How would you know?&quot; he asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've survived it a few times,&quot; the old one said. &quot;I cant walk anymore, and my sight is going. My back hurts and I'm not quick as I used to be. I'm nearly a year old.&quot; <br>
<br>
A year old! That was ancient! The little one stood in awe. Then he realized the meaning of what the old one had said. As it sunk in, he realized he didn't have a mom and dad anymore. And just then everyone heard his brother scream, from far away. The shriek lasted just a few seconds, but it was full of terror and pain. The entire cage stood still and everyone wore a face of horror. The little one began crying. <br>
<br>
The old mouse felt for the little one, so much like himself in his earlier days. So he groomed the little one's fur, and tried to make him feel better. <br>
<br>
&quot;You thought life was wonderful and happy, and that everything would work out in the end, eh?&quot; he asked as he groomed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Y-yeah... that was how the book stories ended...&quot; the little one sobbed. <br>
<br>
&quot;In real life the big people are cruel and uncaring,&quot; the old mouse told him. &quot;Life is unfair and a struggle. Everything is hard. Even if you get out, there is no food and bad weather. No one treats mice well.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;SOMEone has to!&quot; the little mouse said in despair. &quot;Life can't be that terrible all the time!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ha ha ha!&quot; the big mouse laughed. &quot;Wanna bet?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever gotten out?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Many times,&quot; said the big guy. &quot;Every time, I wanted back in!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How terrible! I wont believe it - there has to be hope!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, believe it or not, one day they'll come for you - probably for me first... and I wont be able to fight back anymore. I'm done for next time. That stupid monster - I should have killed him the first time, when he was smaller.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;He...he can be killed?&quot; the little mouse said, barely understanding what killed meant. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yup. He has a weak spot right under his head - side of his neck. But his mouth tends to get in the way, and he has a big mouth.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We can escape together... &quot; the little one hoped out loud. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can't walk, little one. Where would I go?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll take care of you,&quot; little one said. &quot;We can go to the wild...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh so you've heard that myth. No good. Forget it. The mice out there are twenty times faster than we are. We're normal mice... Just mice. We don't stand a chance.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But you fought back - doesn't everyone? Sooner or later someone will kill the thing...won't they?&quot; <br>
<br>
The old one looked sideways at the youngster. &quot;Probably not,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I'm the only one that ever fought back. Then the evil owner tried to put me in a bowl of moving water to drown, but I bit him. He doesn't know what to do with me, but soon I will die. Everyone else is terrified. I was in the monster's lair one time with another mouse...I told him we could ta <br>
