When he woke, he ate more, drank more, and ventured forth into the scary outside world in search of his companions. It was just before night. <br>
<br>
He spoke in alleys to wild mice, and house mice. They had not seen his friends. And they were amazed that a white mouse was loose, much less alive. They warned him of demons called cats - and monsters called dogs - but by far the worst of the threats was being captured again by humans, who laid traps that snapped a poor mouse in half, and laid out sweet smelling poisons that took days of agony to end a tiny life. And while all these horror stories scared our hero, he had already been scared out of his rational mouse mind - and chose not to return to that old mouse he was. He ignored the warnings and simply told them that he must find his friends. <br>
<br>
And out of the darkness amongst the great towers of several trashcans came a soft, deep voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;And why would you risk so much?&quot; said the voice. <br>
<br>
All the other mice he had been speaking to were suddenly gone with a speed that made his best look very slow indeed. <br>
<br>
Fearing another dragon, or worse, he puffed his chest up nevertheless and answered, &quot;Because it is the right thing to do!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said the voice, &quot;that's good enough for me.&quot; And a shape waddled out of the dark toward him. Smaller than he expected, but still several times his size. The Mouse Knight crouched low, rattled his tail and arched his back. If he could kill a dragon, this wayward rodent would pose no challenge. <br>
<br>
&quot;Easy, man,&quot; said the rat. &quot;Normally mice are lunch for us rats, but myself, I've always liked them for conversation instead of dinner. Besides, you're way to tough if you can survive the sewer.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The mouse perked his head and ears forward, sniffing and looking. It was the same rat he had seen in the dark wet place - white with a gold head. <br>
<br>
They just looked at each other for a short moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;Rats eat mice?&quot; The mouse asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yep. All the time,&quot; replied the rat. <br>
<br>
&quot;But you're not going to eat me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not hungry?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not stupid,&quot; replied the rat, and laughed. &quot;I've heard all about you, Mouse Knight.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now, if we were to draw the little mouse as a cartoon, this is where we'd put the exclamation point right over his head. His tail went straight up and his ears popped out to full sail. He didn't say anything, but his face said it all. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I've got the right mouse,&quot; laughed the rat, smiling broadly. &quot;Your friends are up a few blocks hiding out in an old tool shed. They've told everyone about the mouse that killed the snake and rescued them from certain death - even facing off a human in the process!&quot; <br>
<br>
Automatically, the little mouse liked this rat. The rat exuded friendliness and calm. There was nothing at all to dislike. The mouse felt he could trust him instantly. He was strong and handsome. And he had a sweet smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Michael,&quot; said the rat, strolling closer to sniff at the amazed mouse as though he hadn't said anything shocking. &quot;Named after the archangel. Do you have one?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;An archangel?&quot; asked the mouse. <br>
<br>
&quot;No... a name.&quot; <br>
<br>
The mouse lowered his head in deep emotion. <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; said the mouse. &quot;I've always wanted one. Secretly, it's all I've ever really wanted. But... But you have to be owned... by someone that loves you... to have one.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;HA HA HA HA,&quot; laughed Mike. &quot;Well, you have to be owned, that's true, but loved is another story. My owner tossed me out like yesterday's garbage after I wasn't a cute little baby anymore.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Mouseknight's eyes became sad. &quot;Oh... I'm so sorry, Mike.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I'm over it,&quot; the rat said, but he turned his face away and began walking. The mouse followed him, heading in the direction of his friends in the tool shed. &quot;It's over rated, you know? Humans just don't care about us.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Surely... surely there must be one... somewhere... that might?&quot; the mouse asked tentatively. <br>
<br>
The rat stopped for a moment to gaze back. He was still smiling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I've heard that myth. The Caring Human. The Kind One. Don't get your hopes up, kid. It's a fairy tale. Like the Millet Mouse, or the Sugar <br>
