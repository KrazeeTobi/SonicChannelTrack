<br>
chapter 2: Ashitaka's journey<br>
<br>
Ashitaka, the wise woman, and some others were sitting in a small hut.  Ashitaka had a piece of cloth wrapped around his arm, and the wise woman was flicking some stones around on the floor (I'm still scratching my head over that one!).  After a few minutes, she said &quot;I'm afraid this is very bad.  Prince Ashitaka...&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; Said Ashitaka.  &quot;Show everyone your right arm.&quot; ansered the wise woman.  Ashitaka unwound the piece of cloth wrapped around his arm, and held it up for everyone to see.  Where the demon had touched him, he had a twisted, black scar.  &quot;What's it mean?&quot; asked someone.  &quot;Ashitaka, are you prepared to learn what fate the stones have foretold you?&quot; asked the wise woman.  &quot;Yes.&quot; replied Ashitaka.  &quot;I was prepared the very moment I let my arrow fly.&quot; &quot;The infection will spread through your whole body, bone and flesh alike.&quot; said the wise woman.  &quot;It will cause you great pain, then kill you.&quot;  For a moment, no one spoke.  Then, somebody said &quot;Is there no way we can stop it?&quot; another person said &quot;The prince got that wound by defending the village and saving our lives!&quot;  &quot;Do we just sit here and watch him die?&quot; asked another.  &quot;You cannot alter your fate, my prince.&quot; said the wise woman.  &quot;However, you can rise to meet it if you choose.&quot; She handed him a little ball of iron.  &quot;This iron ball was inside the boar.&quot; she said.  &quot;It shattered his bones and bored its way deep inside of him, causing him to become a demon monster.  There is evil at work in the east.  It's your fate to go there, Ashitaka, and see with eyes unclouded by hate.&quot;  Ashitaka prepared to leave.  &quot;Our laws forbid us from watching you go.&quot; said the wise woman.  &quot;Farewell.&quot; She said as he walked out the door.<br>
<br>
Outside, Ashitaka climbed onto Yakkul.  He was about to leave, when Kaya came out and stopped him.  &quot;Kaya?&quot; Ashitaka said, suprised.  &quot;What are you doing out here?  You know it's forbidden!&quot;  &quot;Do you think I care about that?!&quot; asked Kaya.  &quot;I came to give you this so you won't forget your little sister!&quot; she said, handing him a piece of crystal on a string.  &quot;Your crystal dagger!&quot; said Ashitaka.  &quot;Kaya, I can't take this.&quot;  &quot;Please keep it with you, brother.&quot; said Kaya, tears welling up in her eyes.  &quot;Please!  I want you to have it... so you won't... forget!&quot; &quot;Kaya, you know I could never forget you.&quot; said Ashitaka.  He took the dagger, and rode away.<br>
