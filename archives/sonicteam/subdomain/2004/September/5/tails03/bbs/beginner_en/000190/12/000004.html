&gt; &gt; I am, however, going to write another story.  I have 2 say I'm sorry to all the ppl who liked Claws the wolverine, but if u like Star Wars, then you'll LOVE this!!! (it's the story of my favorite movie, Princess Mononoke) I thought I might as well start it now, so here u go! (I might make some spelling mistakes)<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Princess Mononoke<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; chapter 1: the demon<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; In ancient times, most of the earth was covered by lush forest.  Back then, man and beast lived in harmony.  But as time went on, most of the great forests were destroyed.  Those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts, huge and wise, who owed their alligence to the great Forest Spirit.  For those were the days of gods.... and of demons...<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Something was amiss in the forest.  A strange creature was passing through.  It crawled over some grass.  When it moved away, the grass looked as if it had been burned.  The creature was headed strait for a small village.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, a young man was riding his mount, a red elk-like creature with the horns of an antelope.  The red elkalope (that's what I like to call it) was also running to the village.  The man riding it saw some young girls.  &quot;Girls!&quot; He called.  &quot;Ashitaka!&quot; cried one of the girls.  &quot;Hurry!&quot;  Said the man. &quot;The wise woman wants everyone back to the village at once!&quot; &quot;We were talking to Ji-san!&quot; said one of the girls. &quot;Did he see anything?&quot; asked the man. &quot;Yes.&quot; said the girl. &quot;Something's wrong.&quot; &quot;All the birds are gone!&quot; cried the second girl.  &quot;And the animals, too!&quot; added the third girl.  &quot;Hurry back to the village.&quot; said the man.  &quot;I'll go talk to Ji-san!&quot; &quot;Alright.&quot; said one of the girls.  &quot;Be careful!&quot; cried another as the man raced off on his mount.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Later, the man arrived at a watchtower.  Sitting at the top was an old man.  The young man climbed off his mount and climbed up the ladder to where the old man was sitting.  On the way up, the young man saw the creature I mentioned earlier moving around.  &quot;Something's there.&quot; he said quietly.  He reached the top of the watchtower.  &quot;Ji-san.&quot; he said, looking at the old man.  &quot;Did you see it?&quot; &quot;I did.&quot; said Ji-san. (the old man) &quot;It isn't human....  LOOK!!!&quot; He cried, pointing at the trees.  The young man looked in the direction Ji-san was pointing.  The trees were withering right before his eyes!  A few seconds later, a monsterous creature broke through the rock wall surounding the watchtower.  It was a very strange looking creature.  It looked something like a spider made out of black feelers!  It had blood-red eyes.  &quot;It's some kind of demon!&quot; Shouted Ji-san.  &quot;A demon?!&quot; Cried the young man.  The demon rushed out of the now withered forest.  When its body touched the sunlight, the feelers momentarily flew into the sky, exposing a huge brown boar underneath.  The boar let out a terrible roar, then the black feelers covered it again.  The demon-spider-boar rushed over to the watchtower.  &quot;Run, Yakkul, RUN!!!!&quot; Shouted the young man to his elkalope.  Yakkul was to scared to move.  The young man shot an arrow downwards.  It landed right next to Yakkul.  With that, Yakkul ran away just in time.  The demon attacked the tower, causing it to fall over.  The young man grabbed Ji-san and jumped into a nearby tree.  &quot;I've got to stop the demon!&quot; He cried, leaping off a branch.  &quot;Prince Ashitaka!&quot; Shouted Ji-san.  &quot;Be careful!  That thing is cursed!  Don't let it touch you!&quot;  Ashitaka wistled for Yakkul.  Yakkul ran over to Ashitaka, and Ashitaka climbed onto his back.  &quot;Hurry, Yakkul!&quot; He cried.  &quot;We have to stop the demon!&quot;  He rushed after it.  &quot;Calm your fury, oh mighty lord!&quot; Cried Ashitaka when he caught up with it.  &quot;Whatever you may be... God or demon, please leave our village alone!&quot;  But the creature payed no attention.  &quot;Please, stop!  STOP!!&quot; Cried Ashitaka.  When the demon still wouldn't listen, Ashitaka shot it in one of its eyes with an arrow.  The demon sqealed in pain, but continued to advance twared the village.  Suddenly, its black feelers all went after Ashitaka.  They wrapped themselves around his arm.  Ashitakas arm hurt very badly, but he contin <br>
