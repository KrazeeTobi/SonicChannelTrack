The time to write another story, that is. (I promise I'll finish this one!) Just so you know, I love Balto. (I'm kinda immature that way.  Stupid kid movies.... they draw you in and you just wanna keep watching them...) Anyway, a few weeks ago I saw a movie called Wolf Quest.  It's the sequel to Balto.  I've decided to write a story about it.  Here goes.....<br>
<br>
Wolf Quest: part 1<br>
<br>
It was almost pitch-black.  Balto was running across the ice.  He was following a raven.  He got closer.... closer...... suddenly, a giant iceberg broke out of the cold, hard ground in front of him, blocking him from the flying raven.  The raven quickly turned around and faced him, and suddenly the ice under his feet broke, showing freezing water underneath.  Balto quickly turned and ran in the opposite direction, jumping from iceberg to iceberg.  In front of him, Balto saw some wolves, with yellow, glowing eyes.  Balto heard his name being called.  &quot;Baaallltooooo.......  Baaaaaaallltoooooo....... BALTO!!!!!!!&quot; Suddenly, Balto found himself completly soaked.  &quot;BALTO!!!&quot; Shouted the angry goose who had dumped the bucket of water over him, &quot;You were having dream again!  You're not getting any rest because of dream!&quot; Balto lived with a goose named Boris on an old ship that somehow had gotten up on land. &quot;Boris,&quot; said Balto to the goose, &quot;The only thing keeping me from getting rest is you waking me up.  And dreams don't MEAN anything.  They're just...&quot; He yawned. &quot;Dreams.&quot;  &quot;Don't be rediculus!&quot; Shouted Boris. &quot;If you are having same dream over and over again, it means something!&quot; &quot;Whatever.&quot; Said Balto, rather annoyed. &quot;I'm gonna go check on Jenna.  You coming?&quot; &quot;Of course I'm coming!  I'm not finished nagging you yet!&quot; yelled Boris.<br>
<br>
later, just outside of town....<br>
<br>
&quot;So, if dreams mean nothing, vhy is it alvays Raven and pack of vulves?  Vhy not pickled herring?!&quot; asked Boris as he and Balto got closer to Jenna's house.  &quot;Because that would be in one of YOUR dreams, Boris.&quot; replied Balto.  &quot;EXACTLY!&quot; shouted Boris.  &quot;Raven and vulf are only important to you!&quot; Suddenly, Boris pointed upward at a totem pole.  &quot;Look, Balto!  On totem pole!  There is raven, and there is vulf!&quot; &quot;Yeah, so?&quot; asked Balto. &quot;Anyway, what could my dream mean anyway?&quot; &quot;It could mean someting you forgot,&quot; said Boris. &quot;Of maybe something you are supposed to know.&quot; &quot;Well, all I know about this totem pole is that it marks the shortcut to Jenna's, and that's good enough for me.&quot; said Balto.<br>
<br>
in town.....<br>
<br>
An excited scottish terrier rushed over to Balto and Boris.  &quot;I'm so glad I found ya!&quot; he said, with an occasional 'yip yip!' &quot;The stork has landed!  I repeat, THE STORK HAS LANDED!!!!!!&quot; He shouted, an ran off.  &quot;Jenna!&quot; shouted Balto, and he ran off too.  Boris just stood there.  &quot;Vhat stork?  I tought ve vere talking about raven!.... Oh boy, THAT stork!&quot;  He ran after Balto.  &quot;I'm coming, Balto!&quot;<br>
<br>
at Jenna's house....<br>
<br>
Balto walked slowly over to Jenna.  Jenna was a husky with a reddish-brown back and a white belly.  &quot;Well, come on!&quot; she said.  &quot;They don't bite!... At least not yet.&quot;  Balto walked over to her.  In a little basket was a soft blanket, and in the blanket were six puppies.  &quot;Oh, Jenna... They're so beautiful... just like you.&quot; All the puppies looked like miniture Jennas, except for one, who looked like a tiny Balto.  &quot;...And you.&quot; added Jenna.  Boris walked in.  They all stood and looked at the puppies for the longest time....<br>
