A slightly mutated creature was sitting in a cage in the boardroom of PERSON Inc.<br>
&quot;What is it, sir?&quot; asked Opus, one of the PERSON Inc. officials.<br>
&quot;I found it laying on the ground in another dimension, Opus.&quot; replied Velux, the president of PERSON Inc. and head scientist of PERSON Inc. LABS. Everyone at the meeting chuckled at this remark, because they all remembered what a fiasco the inter-dimensional warping project was.<br>
&quot;No, seriously. This is the latest result of our status enhancer drug. The statistical results: strength increased 62%; agility increased 49%; mental capabilities increased 63%; and defense increased 32%. These are not bad results, if you exclude the hideous mutations and bursts of rage,&quot; Velux said, pointing at the creature in the cage, who was vicously thrusting its arms toward various boardmembers, &quot;I expect the LABS team will soon rectify these iniquities, seeing as how I'm the head scientist. And now, I hand over the spotlight to Gustus...&quot;<br>
<br>
Far away, on a cliff somewhere, Kelthet and his cult were having a meeting of their own... a legion of figures in blue and green (with a bit of yellow) hooded cloaks were staring down at the ground and chanting something a bit off. Kelthet, with his iron casted face with a mouth that looked something like an Octorok (copyright of Nintendo), was slowly strolling toward one of the members. <br>
&quot;Does lord Kelthet wish something of me?&quot; asked the member, as Kelthet loomed over him. Kelthet stood there for a second, silent. Then, a short-medium length blade shot out of his left sleeve (still attached to his arm). He swung the blade to his left, slaughtering the member.<br>
&quot;Let this be a reminder that I have the power in this cult,&quot; said Kelthet, softly and indifferent. He did this on occasion to remind his members of just how much power he had. And, also, of what he could do with that power.<br>
The next day, Velux, while working in the lab, received a call. Slamming his fist down on the data he had just collected, Velux walked over to answer the phone.<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; He said with a tone of arrogance in his voice.<br>
&quot;Sir! An intruder has entered the building! They're armed and have already killed all personnel on floors 1-3. They are making their way to---&quot;<br>
Velux stood there, horrified, tuning out the panicked rambling. Who would possibly be commiting such a crime against PERSON Inc.? Nearly everyone depended on PERSON Inc. to provide them with quality goods and such. Who would want to destroy the producer of the people? Who would do such a terror-inducing act?<br>
&quot;Kelthet...&quot; Velux mumbled.<br>
&quot;What, sir?&quot; asked the person on the other end of the line.<br>
&quot;Order an immediate evacuation of floors 7-60. Evacuate them to the rooftop. Request a few helicopters from the Snowflake Empire to aid in our escape. Send all armed personnel to floor 5.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, and Vincent,&quot; said Velux, &quot;Stay alive out there, okay?&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you for your concern, sir&quot; replied Vincent, hanging up the phone.<br>
&quot;What in Kilroy's name is Kelthet doing here...&quot; Velux muttered to himself, &quot;Oh well. I've taken care of him before.&quot; Velux grabbed a hand pistol and made off for the fifth floor.<br>
<br>
The intercom came on, &quot;All personnel on floors 7-60. An evacuation to the rooftop has been ordered. Security personnel are to report to floor 5 to intercept and engage intruder. I repeat: All personnel on floors 7-60. An evacuation to the rooftop has been ordered. Security personnel are to report to floor 5 to intercept and engage intruder.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm,&quot; said the intruder, &quot;That ought to rid the building of useless bystanders. I suppose I'll have to deal with a bit of security, though. All this hassle just to speak with the CEO... tch tch... How unpleasant.&quot; He looked at his sword and smiled meekly.<br>
The intruder had made it to the staircase to the fifth floor. A couple of oblivious personnel were at the top waiting for him. They were a male and a female. Obviously, they had not heard the evacuation notice over the intercom and were just chatting away as though it were a normal day.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, but you are you are in my way. Please mo <br>
