&quot;Page 300-850's: This marked the &quot;Rise of the H@ckers&quot;. About a dozen people, with names such as Hacker1, Hacker2, etc invaded the boards. They stayed for hundreds of pages. The board was rarely posted on, because the hackers threated to delete your account if you rubbed them the wrong way. They took several people and supposedly deleted their accounts. Well, I didn't believe them, so me and big mouth made a long speech on page 371 about how they were fake terrorists. 1 day later, I couldn't log on. It told me my account had been marked closed. Odd, huh? On pahe 416, I signed up wiith an account in the 4000's called: Enzo (Reboot). I stayed quiet for a while, until all the hackers were banned.&quot;<br>
<br>
ROTFL, that's some funny shit. It's also a crock of shit aswell. In order to do such said stuff as deleting accounts, they would have to have Administrative controls, and to achieve that they would have to have &quot;hacked&quot; into the whole of sonicteam, which I doubt. Even if, the security logs would immediately show such intrusions, and repair what was exploited. Bullshit. <br>
<br>
And lastly, if they were indeed &quot;hackers&quot;, they would not call themselves such. Not even &quot;blackhats&quot; would stoop as low, they'd just act superior and delete accounts. Warning them all the time, of course. I suggest whoever has said such bullshit die, because they themselves probably just made it up, on the spot. I see no report of &quot;The rise of Eclipse&quot;.  Now although that may sound egotistical, It was a very momentous occassion for this little BBS.
