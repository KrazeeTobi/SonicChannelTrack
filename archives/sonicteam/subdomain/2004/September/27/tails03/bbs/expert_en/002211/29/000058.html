&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It happens.. ..Woah. I just sneezed.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt; I hope you arent coming down with something... Like half our schools been sick in the last week or two... some stomach flu...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I doubt it.. I hardly ever get sick.. I think the worst that's happened to me was that 103.8 fever I had one time.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Err... Isnt like 104.5 the level when you go to a hospital..?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Possibly.. I dunno. But.. I know it never got that high. Hm.. I remember one day. I asked everybody what they would do if I ever went into a coma. They all said they'd come visit me.. Except Xero who said he'd be by my bed side day and night. I thought that was madd sweet.. Heh.. But. Yeah.. Yano.. I almost forgot how we got into this topic..<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; X.x I have forgotten, so don't look at me... Yeah... I've sometimes wondered who would care if i was in a coma. I dont know which of my 'friends' would, although I think I can count on alot of them. And of course all my online friends would have no idea what happened &gt;&lt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well.. If I ever found out.. I'd be sure to hunt ya down and be there for ya. Possibly spend every day trying to wake ya up. I mean.. You're my friend.. And a really great one at that. I don't want anything even near to bad happen.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P I'd find some way to let you know. Or something. <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In other, less depressing news<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaerin waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht frist and lsat ltteer is at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do not raed ervey lteter by it slef but the wrod as a wlohe. <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isnt that weird?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Scariest part.. I could actually read that.. I mean.. It's true though. You see the first and last letter and pretty much know exactly what the word is.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I know, but the idea is just weird... I mean, it almost justifys newbspeak!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Heh. Yeah. That's true! ..Wow. We're having two seperate conversations. We're so silly.<br>
<br>
Yeah... That is slightly weird... <br>
<br>
But yeah, just try at http://www.mediaminer.org, thats where they are. &quot;Present time&quot; is a good one, I think.
