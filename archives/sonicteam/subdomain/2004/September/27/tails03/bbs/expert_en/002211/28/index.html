Actually not bad. I felt less fat because a 9th grader who looked at least half my weight was able to pick me up and carry me piggy back close to half around the park.. I jumped off his back only because I didn't wanna hurt him. But I'm sure he coulda gone further. ..That same kid dry humped me because he first asked my friend if she wanted to fuck. She was like, &quot;uhh.. no..&quot; Then he asked me.. I was like, &quot;Uh.. Sure! Why not!?&quot; so yeah.

&gt; &gt; <br>

&gt; I call my friend's little sister, who's also my friend, my bitch. And she accepts it. Then I called all my other friends my bitches.. Then I was married to one of them.. And dating another lol We're weird like that.<br>
<br>
:P One of my friends has minons. Its scary. The freshmen do what she tells them... &gt;&lt; Including read yaoi. Which is scaryer since most of them are strait boys.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I was doing that to people yesterday with quotes from you. I had to explain what BDSM was to someone...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Heh. I'm so special. I love to scare off people... That's why.. At the mall.. I went around asking people to be my friend. And.. Believe it or not.. 12 out of the 13 I asked said yes. Haha<br>
<br>
Heh. I dont do that. I occasionally walk around and tell random people &quot;Omae wa Korosu&quot; though. The people that do understand it laugh, and everyone else moves away. Very quickly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's exactly it! I'm the party man! I AM the party! ...Dont' ask. Just.. Don't.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P I wasnt planning on it... But yeah. other than earlyer, hows your day been..?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually not bad. I felt less fat because a 9th grader who looked at least half my weight was able to pick me up and carry me piggy back close to half around the park.. I jumped off his back only because I didn't wanna hurt him. But I'm sure he coulda gone further. ..That same kid dry humped me because he first asked my friend if she wanted to fuck. She was like, &quot;uhh.. no..&quot; Then he asked me.. I was like, &quot;Uh.. Sure! Why not!?&quot; so yeah.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; X.x And I thought my friends were weird...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I call my friend's little sister, who's also my friend, my bitch. And she accepts it. Then I called all my other friends my bitches.. Then I was married to one of them.. And dating another lol We're weird like that.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P One of my friends has minons. Its scary. The freshmen do what she tells them... &gt;&lt; Including read yaoi. Which is scaryer since most of them are strait boys.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>

I scream randomly.. People stare at me.. Then walk away. Usually I wear my baggy pants.. And the people walks FAR away from me. I wanna laugh so hard when they do.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; X.x And I thought my friends were weird...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I call my friend's little sister, who's also my friend, my bitch. And she accepts it. Then I called all my other friends my bitches.. Then I was married to one of them.. And dating another lol We're weird like that.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P One of my friends has minons. Its scary. The freshmen do what she tells them... &gt;&lt; Including read yaoi. Which is scaryer since most of them are strait boys.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think you scared kagome away...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than likely. Oh well. I have a tendency of doing that. ^^'''<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I was doing that to people yesterday with quotes from you. I had to explain what BDSM was to someone...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I'm so special. I love to scare off people... That's why.. At the mall.. I went around asking people to be my friend. And.. Believe it or not.. 12 out of the 13 I asked said yes. Haha<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I dont do that. I occasionally walk around and tell random people &quot;Omae wa Korosu&quot; though. The people that do understand it laugh, and everyone else moves away. Very quickly.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I scream randomly.. People stare at me.. Then walk away. Usually I wear my baggy pants.. And the people walks FAR away from me. I wanna laugh so hard when they do.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; :P I should try that. It might be nice to get some of the freshmen to go away...<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; It's weird.. I'm friends with freshmen, sophmores (duh), juniors, and seniors, PLUS the littler kids!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I'm friends with a few juniors, but I dont really know the freshemen and seniors...<br>
<br>
Well.. I met many freshmen through my sophmore friends.. And juniors because I'm in two 11th grade classes. And seniors because my sis is a senior.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I was doing that to people yesterday with quotes from you. I had to explain what BDSM was to someone...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I'm so special. I love to scare off people... That's why.. At the mall.. I went around asking people to be my friend. And.. Believe it or not.. 12 out of the 13 I asked said yes. Haha<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I dont do that. I occasionally walk around and tell random people &quot;Omae wa Korosu&quot; though. The people that do understand it laugh, and everyone else moves away. Very quickly.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I scream randomly.. People stare at me.. Then walk away. Usually I wear my baggy pants.. And the people walks FAR away from me. I wanna laugh so hard when they do.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P I should try that. It might be nice to get some of the freshmen to go away...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's weird.. I'm friends with freshmen, sophmores (duh), juniors, and seniors, PLUS the littler kids!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm friends with a few juniors, but I dont really know the freshemen and seniors...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well.. I met many freshmen through my sophmore friends.. And juniors because I'm in two 11th grade classes. And seniors because my sis is a senior.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Aah... Yeah... I'm in the stupid class, just taking geometry this year, instead of last like alot of people, so I've got freshmen in that class. My art class has a few juniors in it too, but that's about it...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I'm actually very bright. But I never really admit it. I always say I'm dumb.<br>
<br>
Having read some of the poems you put up as away msg's, i definitly belive it. You write really really well...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P One of my friends has minons. Its scary. The freshmen do what she tells them... &gt;&lt; Including read yaoi. Which is scaryer since most of them are strait boys.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think you scared kagome away...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than likely. Oh well. I have a tendency of doing that. ^^'''<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I was doing that to people yesterday with quotes from you. I had to explain what BDSM was to someone...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I'm so special. I love to scare off people... That's why.. At the mall.. I went around asking people to be my friend. And.. Believe it or not.. 12 out of the 13 I asked said yes. Haha<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh. I dont do that. I occasionally walk around and tell random people &quot;Omae wa Korosu&quot; though. The people that do understand it laugh, and everyone else moves away. Very quickly.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I scream randomly.. People stare at me.. Then walk away. Usually I wear my baggy pants.. And the people walks FAR away from me. I wanna laugh so hard when they do.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :P I should try that. It might be nice to get some of the freshmen to go away...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's weird.. I'm friends with freshmen, sophmores (duh), juniors, and seniors, PLUS the littler kids!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm friends with a few juniors, but I dont really know the freshemen and seniors...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well.. I met many freshmen through my sophmore friends.. And juniors because I'm in two 11th grade classes. And seniors because my sis is a senior.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aah... Yeah... I'm in the stupid class, just taking geometry this year, instead of last like alot of people, so I've got freshmen in that class. My art class has a few juniors in it too, but that's about it...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm actually very bright. But I never really admit it. I always say I'm dumb.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Having read some of the poems you put up as away msg's, i definitly belive it. You write really really well...<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; *laughs nervously, blushes slightly* Well.. I'm not that great a writer. I .. I just draw from what I go through really.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Still... Your articulate. something I need to work on. I'd be dead if not for dictation programs...<br>
<br>
You're really nice. A very sweet guy.. Not many of those around.. Heh..

I felt less fat because a 9th grader who looked at least half my weight was able to pick me up and carry me piggy back close to half around the park.. I jumped off his back only because I didn't wanna hurt him. But I'm sure he coulda gone further. ..That same kid dry humped me because he first asked my friend if she wanted to fuck. She was like, &quot;uhh.. no..&quot; Then he asked me.. I was like, &quot;Uh.. Sure! Why not!?&quot; so yeah.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I call my friend's little sister, who's also my friend, my bitch. And she accepts it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ^^&quot; Thanks... I dont try to attack newbs... I just wind up doing it accidently. They end up acting stupid, and I point it out, and then they respond with &quot;OMGF!!!111oneoneononeonethree YU HAOR! I LEIK HTAE U SO MUCH CASUE UR STUPOD ND STFF!&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *giggles* That's funny! Oh! That reminds me.. One time.. MK did shit like that.. He was making fun of me for being obsessed with Inuyasha.. And I was like, &quot;Holy fucking hell! PREP ALERT!! EVERYBODY! TO THE PREP SHELTER!! *danananananana!*&quot; And then. I put that in my profile. And we all kept laughing.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lol! Yeah... Inu-yasha is great, although I havent seen that much of it. There's some really great fanfiction out there about it though... (www.iridecesntdreams.net or something close to that. I think I misspelled it. It has great ones.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm always heading to fanfiction.net for some good fics.. Heh. I write my own as well. But they get a bit.. Er.. Lemony.. So.. I don't normally let people read them.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whats a good fic without a bit of lemon? But yeah. I think thats the url, although you've probably read them at ff.net... <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Heh. My lemons are very lemony. But.. It's all from my head.. And sometimes I believe I might have more testosterone than estrogen (lol a little biology humor)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Heh. Theres nothing wrong with lemons though. Just dont post them at ff.net, or they delete you.. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; erk brb.<br>
<br>
Alright. I'll only be answering on the other posting though now. Because I'm going soon anyways.
