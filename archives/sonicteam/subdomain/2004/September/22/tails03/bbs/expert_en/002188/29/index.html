My story begins in the land of Things Forgotten.  At the same time my story began, another ended.  In the same place to.  Draik eggs are very valuble, so a thief stole one.  That one happened to be mine.  My parents, a dark purple draik and a black draik with fire markings, tried to recue me, of course.  They battled the thief, making him drop the egg.  But my parents were so busy fighting the thief that they didn't notice the egg laying on the ground.  One draik accidently kicked the egg, making it roll down a hill.<br>
<br>
A while later, I broke my way out.  I looked around, expecting to see my parents looking down at me.  Instead, I saw them lying on the ground, dead.  However, I was too young to understand death.  I watched them with wide eyes, believing they would get up any minute.  But after waiting for over an hour, I gave up.<br>
<br>
I wandered aimlessly, not knowing where to turn.  Suddenly, three draiks appeared in the sky.  One was purple, like me, but he had orange freckles on his face.  The webbing on his wings and ears was white.  He also has three long white hairs on his forehead. (like Tails, only they're white instead of orange)  The second one looked like the first, except he was grey where the first was white, and white where the first was purple.  Instead of the freckles, he had navy blue stripes.  One on each leg, one on each ankle, two on each arm, one on his muzzle, and four on his tail.  The third and final one was dark grey, but she had many black stripes all over her body.  They swooped down and picked me up, before carrying me away.<br>
