Spyke the Silver Echidna: part two<br>
<br>
By Spyke<br>
<br>
Last time: Knuckles had fallen off a cliff.  He woke up in a hut.  He found out that a silver echidna named Spyke had saved him.  an alarm like sound came from outside.<br>
<br>
Knuckles heard screams from outside.  Then there was an evil laughing sound.  Suddenly, Knuckles knew what was happening.  Dr. Eggman was attacking the village!  Knuckles knew he needed to stay in bed, but he jumped out to see what was going on.  Eggman was in a HUGE robot!  It was using master emerald's power to destroy everything!  &quot;So, that's why Eggman wanted the emerald!&quot; thought Knuckles.  Suddenly, a bunch of Eggman's other robots surrounded all the echidnas in the village!  They were all silver, like Spyke.  Then, a cage came out of Eggman's big robot, trapping the terrified echidnas.  He had captured them!  The cage lifted up, taking the echidnas with it.  Then, all of Eggman's robots destroyed the village!  After that, Eggman and his robots left for Robotropolis.  &quot;NOOOOOO!!!!  SPYKE!!!!!&quot;  Cried Knuckles.  But it was no use.  She and the others were gone.  Suddenly, Knuckles got an idea.  He ran after Eggman's robots as fast as he could...<br>
