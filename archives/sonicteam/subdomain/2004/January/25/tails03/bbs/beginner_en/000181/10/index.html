Appearance: <br>
A human body with white, delicate, short fur, with long ears that come down to his knees. Has a long tail that reaches to the top of my head. Legs (Cal doesn't have legs. That's why I added them), three huge fingers on his hands, green eyes, 4 toes with short claws, a skinny, medium muscular (in between very and not very muscular) figure. Wears tattered rags (cannot afford new clothes). Has ears extend whenever he is happy, they shorten when he is sad. Has his left ear pierced. Red triangles on his hands. Short whiskers, maybe one inch long. Has short white hair on his head. Wears a tattered cloak.<br>
<br>
Story:<br>
From what I know, I was an experiment on another planet. My memory is blurry. I remember seeing sparks and flashy lights. It felt like an interrogation. &quot;Finished!&quot; I heard one of the scientists say and he smirked in my face. I heard a female scientist address him as &quot;Dr. Osto&quot;. I felt a surge of power and I immediately was petrified. I couldn't move. I looked to the right of me and saw some kind of paper with the heading, &quot;The 'H' Project&quot;. My eyes widened at what this could mean. I wasn't real? I don't exist? Who am I? What am I? I look over my past memories for clues. During the night, they had locked me in a photonic cage, at least that's what a tag read. I don't know much human language. I thought or dreamed I moved my hands in a certain fashion and I bent the bars! I opened my eyes and was amazed at what I did. What I imagined, came to life. My long ears helped guide me through the lab without making a sound. It was as if I had supernatural powers. I darted through the sky and away from the lab. I didn't know anything other than when I was on that platform in the lab. Those scoundrels had kept me there like an animal! The scientists were of different species. Foxes, lions, etc., not the common house pet but they stood upright unusually and they wore glasses. Anyway, what to do now was unclear. Whether to hide out on this unknown planet, fight against the scientists, releasing all the subjects, find out more about that test facility and Dr. Osto or to search for a way to get off this planet!? I lived off the planet's resources, living in caves, eating strange fruits that I saw a giant ape, at least that's what it seemed to be, eat and it cooked it by shooting fire out of its mouth, killing native beasts for meat to eat with a pair of dagger-like weapons I like to call &quot;The Sun and the Moon&quot;. Then I stumbled upon a shuttle that was going to be launched to return to Earth. I believe I saw a banner with &quot;Pioneer 1&quot; on it. Apparently, they must not have liked the planet. I became a stowaway on the ship and rode it to Earth and disembarked. I felt as if I was home, but I didn't remember an Earth feeling. I darted around in the sky above a forest and then I saw a clearing. I landed in the clearing. A hidden cavern was to the left of me while a pile of fruit was right in front of me. It was tropical paradise compared to what was on the other planet. I feel lighter here, though. It feels odd. I soon heard a rumble, it sounded like thunder. I looked around frantically for the source. I then saw a black figure in the trees. I ran into the cave, fearing for my safety. The black figure was a strange shape and I couldn't put my finger on what it might be. Anyway, I saw yellow eyes looking at me so I didn't look. The figure took the fruit elsewhere. I wandered out of the cave, hungry and depressed. I heard city-like noises a couple miles away (my ears help that out alot.). I traveled towards those noises. The city was strange. Strange metal things with wheels (cars) were moving fast, near me, who knows what they were. I knew nothing about this world. All I knew was fighting. I saw people hand green paper (money) over to other people. The people traded this money for items. I was confused. I think you get things by giving people green papers. I went into a bar and the man behind the counter became scared and offered me a drink. I drank this strangely-colored liquid and decided to drink more of it. Not too much, for  <br>

 the bartender started to charge money. I saw a poster on the east wall that asked for a mercenary, and that a reward will be given. I found out that an &quot;S&quot; with lines through it means green paper. I took the job and completed it flawlessly. I got $100 for that job. I stuck to that routine until today. I go to the same bar everyday, hoping to find the answers to my existence. I know it might not be the best idea but maybe I'll learn something on one of my mercenary jobs. I have to become acquainted with this city enviroment as well. My destiny I am unclear of. I must find the answer!<br>
After one of my mercenary jobs, I became weak and stumbled into the city, looking for a medic of some sort. I thought to myself, if people saw me and saw what I was like, think of what they'd do! I could end up in a laboratory again! So I hid in the alleys, hoping the pain would blow over. I felt as if my head would split. I fell asleep and woke up in a bed. I looked at myself in a mirror as a different person. I was a human. I went back into my room and saw a Calumon. I remember. Calumon and I were one to create the Demi-Human Cyanalu. What happened to bring me to the one planet where? I must have been first fused there. The world returned to normal for me until school hit. I entered class knowing few of my classmates. I felt weird. The information from the lessons from the past couple of weeks were blurry to me. Maybe fusion depletes a part of my unecessary memory. I didn't care, as long I had my Digimon and my girlfriend. Thank god I remembered my girlfriend's name or she'd probably dump me, my best friend's name and some others. But I had to re-learn the others. It felt embarrassing but at the same time, cool. I had a second chance to redeem myself and keep out all the other embarrassing experiences with those people. And Cal's memory is as bleak as mine, which might or might not be good. I watched the school news, only remembring one person, who I thought of as a rival. With what I went through, that's a miracle. I went into class with a blank mind. I remembered who I sat next to, Abby and Julie. I sat down and looked at Mrs. Catania, my social studies teacher, blankly, wide-eyed and scared that I'd be called on for a question. &quot;Hey, Ryan!&quot; said the perky Mrs. Catania, &quot;Where ya been these two weeks?&quot; I held back my gasp at the statement. &quot;I was gone for two weeks?&quot; I responded. &quot;Yeah...&quot; said Mrs. Catania, becoming suspicious. &quot;Oh yeah! I was on a much needed vacation!&quot; I said, nervously. &quot;Well, I believe that's the longest alotted amount of time to take off for a vacation. Besides, don'tcha know that we miss you?&quot; she responded. &quot;I won't miss anymore days, Mrs. Catania.&quot; I sat down afterwards for class. Luckily, all that class, we took notes, and just a tiny bit of questions, like 2 or 3. I instantly became happy because of not being embarrassed, but not for long. I had science next and Mr. Balest asks a lot of questions. I gulped and walked in the room. I vaguely remembered where I sat. Lauren, the person I sat next to, helped me out, but she didn't get suspcious of my loss of memory. Mr. Balest had little cards shuffled with numbers on them and whenever he asks a question, he picks the top one off and calls on the person with that designated number, according to his class list. I almost got called on, the numbers adjacent to mine had to answer, but then again I didn't know what number I was. I got through the class, without having to answer any questions, not listening because I knew Cal and I would fuse again soon so why bother trying to learn any more!?<br>
