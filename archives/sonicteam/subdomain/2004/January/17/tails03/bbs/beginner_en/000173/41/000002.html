&gt; How do u get get a chao with different colors. &gt;Lke a shadow chao with red stripes <br>
<br>
Make it dark and give it running animals and green Chaos drives.<br>
<br>
So to answer your question, you need to give it a certain type of animals/chaos drives and make it neutral, hero or dark to find the one you want.<br>
Here is a part of guide from  NMcNair:<br>
<br>
NEUTRAL:<br>
<br>
     Note:  It would seem that Sonic Team has left the neutral evolution<br>
     patterns the same as the first game.<br>
<br>
     Normal/Running   :  Top of Chao's head grow longer and pointy.<br>
<br>
          Normal/Swimming  :  The top of the chao's head becomes thinner<br>
     and curves forward more, it resembles a thorn almost.<br>
<br>
     Normal/Power     :  Chao Spike splits slightly, typical of horns,<br>
     only smaller.<br>
<br>
     Normal/Flying    :  The tip of the chao's head curls up.<br>
<br>
     Running/Running  :  Sonic Chao.  This chao is the sonic chao,<br>
     and is a fun chao to show to your friends.<br>
<br>
     Running/Swimming :  The chao will turn aqua and will become elongated<br>
     and have a very aerodynamic look.<br>
<br>
     Running/Power    :  The Chao's spikes will turn upward<br>
     and he will get huge fists.<br>
<br>
     Running/Flying   :  The Spikes on the head and end of the toes curl up.<br>
<br>
     Swimming/Swimming:  The head and body become streamlined and the<br>
     ears become huge and hang down, all the way to the ground.<br>
<br>
     Swimming/Running :  The head will shorten and the chao will<br>
     turn greener than it had been.<br>
<br>
     Swimming/Power   :  This Chao is fat.  It is a huge chao and<br>
     looks like it would fit into the infamous Weird AL video.<br>
<br>
     Swimming/Flying  :  The head curl upward, like a regular chao, but<br>
     is a much darker color.<br>
<br>
     Power/Power      :  Retains the shape of the normal power chao,<br>
     but turns a very dark red.<br>
<br>
     Power/Running    :  Spike curls down, similar to sonic chao.<br>
<br>
     Power/Swimming   :  The head becomes very long, and resembles<br>
     the rocketeer (if anyone remembers the rocketeer).<br>
<br>
     Power/Flying     :  This is the coolest chao in the game, it<br>
     gets Knuckles like fists, and the head curls up and down, trust me,<br>
     it is worth it.<br>
<br>
     Flying/Flying    :  This is the NiGHTS chao.  It looks just like<br>
     NiGHTS from Sonic Team's great game.<br>
<br>
     Flying/Running   :  The spikes curl around much like a rams<br>
     horns, it also turns a deeper pink.<br>
<br>
     Flying/Power     :  Turns red and the spikes turn upward at a<br>
     steep angle.<br>
<br>
     Flying/Swimming  :  This is my second favorite chao in the game,<br>
     it becomes very elongated and arms become very wing like,<br>
     this is a great chao.<br>
<br>
<br>
HERO:<br>
<br>
     Hero/Normal/Running   :  antenna elongate.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Normal/Swimming  :  Not sure just yet, if you have one<br>
     and can send a picture, please do so, or a description and I<br>
     will post it and give you credit.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Normal/Power     :  Not sure just yet, if you have one<br>
     and can send a picture, please do so, or a description and I<br>
     will post it and give you credit.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Normal/Flying    :  Not sure just yet, if you have one<br>
     and can send a picture, please do so, or a description and I<br>
     will post it and give you credit.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Running/Running  :  The Antenna splits into three at the end,<br>
     Retains the coloration, and the antenna keeps the spiked look<br>
     It initially had.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Running/Swimming :  he still has the spike, but 2 spikes pop<br>
     Out and bends down at a 45 degree angle. the spikes' colors are<br>
     blue, yellow, blue, yellow ect. the belly's blue part turns<br>
     smaller and it has a yellow border.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Running/Power    :  The single antenna spike becomes much<br>
     Larger and the chao takes on a purple coloration.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Running/Flying   :   Tail and Head Spike split into two towards<br>
     the end of both, and become more rounded and less spike like<br>
     , the blue/white alternating colors change to a blue/purple<br>
     pattern, pretty cool chao.<br>
<br>
     Hero/Swimming/Swimming:  The antenna become longer.<br>
<br>
And there's more.
