Spyke the Silver Echidna: part nine<br>
<br>
&quot;Knuckles, you stay here.  I'm gonna go see what's going on.&quot; said Spyke, quietly leaving the hut.  &quot;Be careful.&quot; said Knuckles.  A few seconds later, there was the sound of pieces of metal hitting each other.  Sonic and Tails woke up.  &quot;What's going on?&quot; asked Tails.  &quot;There were some noises outside.  Spyke went to check it out.&quot; replied Knuckles.  &quot;Well, I'm going out there to.&quot; said Sonic.  &quot;Me to!&quot; said Tails.  &quot;Well, your not leaving me behind.&quot; said Knuckles.  So, they snuck out of the hut.  Outside, they saw Spyke beating up a bunch of Eggman's robots!  He was back!  &quot;Guys, help!&quot; shouted Spyke.  So, the three heros joined in the fight.  At first, it was easy.  But, when they had defeated the last robot, they were all egsausted(&lt;spelling mistake)  Well, at least, they THOUGHT it was the last robot.  Suddenly, dozens more robots appeared.  &quot;We can't beat them.&quot; said Spyke.  &quot;We have to surrender.&quot;  Suddenly, someone, or someTHING, ran past the four friends.  &quot;What was that?&quot; asked Sonic.  A purple wolverine rushed out of the forest.  He looked something like knuckles, but with long, elf-like ears, and twice as many spikes on his hands.  He went and destroyed all the robots!  &quot;Okay, okay, I'll let you go!&quot;  Eggman came out of the forest in his robot.  &quot;I'll stop trying to catch you.&quot; he said.  The wolverine didn't seem to hear him.  He jumped onto Eggman's robot and knocked him out of it!  Eggman fell to the ground, then ran away, screaming.  &quot;Don't listen to that guy.&quot; said the wolverine in a deep voice.  &quot;He's trouble.&quot; then he rushed back into the forest.  The friends didn't know who that wolverine was, or why he saved them, but they did know one thing: Eggman wasn't going to be bugging them for a while.<br>
<br>
THE END<br>
<br>
After:<br>
<br>
Spyke rebuilt her village, with the help of Sonic, Knuckles and Tails, and it is open to anyone who needs a home.  Knuckles told Spyke how he feels about her, and they sometimes go on dates.  Oh, and that wolverine?  I'm thinking about writing a story about him, too.  Anyone who thinks I should, tell me.
