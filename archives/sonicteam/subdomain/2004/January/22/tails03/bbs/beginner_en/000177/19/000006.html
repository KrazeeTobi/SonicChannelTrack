&gt; Claws the Wolverine: part two<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;Master,&quot; said Claws.  &quot;Can I use some of that potion?&quot;  &quot;NO!&quot;  said the wizard.  Claws had always hated this wizard, but now he had had enough.  His eyes turned red with fury.  Fortunatly, the wizard didn't notice.  Claws knew that if he disobeyed him, the wizard would get very angry.  Suddenly, Claws got an idea.  He had never gotten such an idea, and he knew he would probably get into trouble, but he didn't care.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; that night, when the wizard was asleep:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Claws quietly snuck downstairs to the potion room.  On the table was the time travel potion.  &quot;Yes!  It's still right where I left it!&quot; thought Claws.  He quietly walked over to where the potion was, picked it up, and drank it down as fast as he could.  It tasted horrible.  Claws had never tasted anything so awful.  It was like rotten eggs mixed with mud and puke.  Then, Claws noticed something.  He wasn't in the potion room anymore.  &quot;Am I inside a rainbow?&quot; thought Claws.  There were colors all around him, and he seemed to be floating!  &quot;I think I'm gonna be sick.&quot;  He said.  The colors swirled all around, and then, seemed to turn into different shapes.  For example, green became grass.  Grey became rocks.  Brown became tree trunks.  &quot;Where am I?&quot; thought Claws....<br>
