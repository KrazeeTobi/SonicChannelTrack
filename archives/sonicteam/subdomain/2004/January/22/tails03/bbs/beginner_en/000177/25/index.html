Claws the Wolverine: part four<br>
<br>
Claws woke up in a hospital.  But of coarse, he didn't know anything about the modern world, so he didn't know what to do.  Suddenly, Claws noticed that there was somebody watching him.  He didn't know it yet, but Sonic had saved him and was now waiting to see if he was okay!  &quot;Who are you?&quot; asked Claws.  Sonic hadn't noticed that he was awake, because he was looking out the window.  When he heard Claws' voice, he looked at him and said, &quot;I'm Sonic.  Who are you?&quot;  &quot;My name's Claws.&quot; replied Claws.  &quot;What happend?  The last thing I remember was being attacked by metal creatures...&quot;  Well, Sonic told Claws what happend.  &quot;I was taking a walk, and I found this clearing and there were a bunch of robots in a circle.  I beat them up, and then I saw you.  You were in pretty bad shape, so I took you here as fast as I could.&quot;  &quot;Robots?....  Is that what those metal things are called?&quot; asked Claws.  &quot;Yeah.&quot; ansered Sonic. &quot;So, where are you from?&quot;  &quot;Well...&quot; said Claws....<br>
