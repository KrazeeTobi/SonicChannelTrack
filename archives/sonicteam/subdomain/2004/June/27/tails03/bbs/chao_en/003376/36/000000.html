one day there was a chaos chao and sonic got mad at him and left him. The chao sat lonely in the garden knowing he couldnt die  but could starve. he ran out of the chao garden and cried and wished he could go back in time. &quot;I'm a transparent blue chaos chao&quot; he said to himself.&quot;im masters favorite color.&quot; Later he went to the real world and went through the streets and was kicked around by people. Later, he knew he could fly so he flew up on the top of the sky scraper in an old town and ran into sonic or atleast he thought it was sonic but yet it was shadow. He heard &quot;i promise you revenge sonic for nearly killing me.&quot;The little chao thought sonic was good and got confused because he thought sonic could never kill anyone. So he ran up to shadow and hugged him. &quot;aha gotcha i knew you were there. Now i will use you as a hostage&quot; said shadow. Then shadow heard the sound of water and said &quot;no it cant be chaos 0!&quot; Then in the speed of light knocked him out and grabbed the chao and standed on shadow and said in his own voice &quot;all hail perfect chaos and your owner sonic misses u now so im gonna take you back to sonic.&quot; Then when they got to sonic in the chao garden. &quot;Oh thanks but no thanks chaos hes been a bad chao you take him&quot; then the chao smiled and jumped into the air filled with joy. &quot;now chao your coming with me you heard sonic were gonna be happy together after all im your hero.&quot;<br>
