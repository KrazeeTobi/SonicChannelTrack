Finneas stared at the fish. Rufus was smiling slightly. Smiling in a sort of smug, arrogant-yet-modest way.<br>
   &quot;I'm terribly sorry, sir,&quot; Swazi apologized, &quot;We need to get a leash for him, or something. He doesn't know right from green.&quot;<br>
   &quot;What the heck?&quot; Finneas shrugged his shoulders and swung the fish about lightly. &quot;It's better than cursing my head off. And much more entertaining,&quot; He handed the fish to Rufus, mumbling triumphantly about how he'd look so stupid fruitlessly smacking a tank with a fish. Rufus smirked and briskly slapped the fish against the tank debris. Instantaneously, the tank appeared before them fully in tact and humming happily. Swazi, Finneas, and Quack stood in awe. Rufus stood in gum, smirking sagely nonetheless.<br>
   &quot;I... How...?&quot; began Swazi.<br>
   &quot;Huh...? Wha...?&quot; suggested Quack.<br>
   &quot;But... and...&quot; concluded Finneas.<br>
   &quot;It's all in the wrist.&quot; assured Rufus, modestly. The gears in Swazi's brain fell into place.<br>
   &quot;A tank!&quot; he cried, &quot;We could use one of those!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yeah, well, it's not for sale, debris-boy.&quot; grunted Finneas.<br>
   &quot;No no no no no. I didn't mean it like that. I meant... Well, you see, we're sort of contemplating this little rebellion...&quot; And so Swazi explained to them the situation and pleaded for their help.<br>
   &quot;Are you crazy?!&quot; shouted Finneas, when Swazi asked for their assistance, &quot;Oppose Mr. Cheese?! It's absurd! It's suicide! It's absurd suicide, for crying out loud!&quot;<br>
   &quot;But... But... But we can restore order to the world! We can kick those sorry giraffes out of control- maybe even launch them into orbit or something- and humans can dominate the earth once more!&quot; Swazi said.<br>
   &quot;No! We won't help you! C'mon, Rufus! Let's go.&quot; He headed to the left side of the tank. Rufus stood still as a fence post, which are rather diligent at remaining motionless. Finneas backed up and stood next to Rufus, staring at him. &quot;Well? Are you coming?&quot;<br>
   Rufus swung the fish with such ferocity that it took Finneas a minute or two to realize he'd been nailed in the face by a seafaring critter.<br>
   &quot;Is your head fixed now?&quot; Rufus asked quietly. Finneas nodded.<br>
   &quot;Yeah, thanks. It wasn't quite screwed in correctly. Anyway, this is the perfect opportunity to restore balance to the world. To put giraffes in their rightful place. To restore democracy and banish anarchy. Yeah, we'll join your little rebellion.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ah, the reparative properties of fish...&quot; Rufus began airily.<br>
   &quot;Gifford!&quot; Rocklobster shouted, &quot;The pudding likes you!&quot; <br>
   &quot;What about pudd---&quot; Swazi ceased his question right about the time a forlorn shoe slammed into his face. He fell to the floor, then cursed, because he fell in glass.<br>
   &quot;Aw, isn't that sweet, Treeburt?&quot; Rocklobster inquired of his suitcase, &quot;Gifford's playing in glass because the pudding kissed him. They grow up so fast...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Er, sorry about that!&quot; piped Llama, &quot;I didn't mean to throw my pudding- er, I mean, shoe- in that direction. I wasn't aiming for you! I promise! Really!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Ahem. Well,&quot; said Quack, deciding that if he didn't say something relevant to the storyline that this narrative would go nowhere fast, much like it already has, &quot;You wouldn't mind giving us a lift back in that tank, would you? Our jeep's about a mile away, partially crushed against a dumpster.&quot;<br>
<br>
   For those of you who can't bother with keeping track, there are now seven members of SwaziLand. One of which is supposedly a suitcase.
