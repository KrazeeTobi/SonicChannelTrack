 There was a professor of philosophy there who was a deeply <br>
committed atheist. His primary goal for one required class was to <br>
spend the entire semester attempting to prove that God couldn't exist. <br>
His students were always afraid to argue with him because of his <br>
impeccable logic. <br>
<br>
    For twenty years, he had taught this class and no one had ever had <br>
the courage to go against him. Sure, some had argued in class at <br>
times, but no one had ever 'really gone against him' (you'll see what <br>
I mean later). Nobody would go against him because he had a <br>
reputation. At the end of every semester, on the last day, he would <br>
say to his class of 300 students, &quot;If there's anyone here who still <br>
believes in Jesus, stand up!&quot; In twenty years, no one had ever stood <br>
up. They knew what he was going to do next. <br>
<br>
<br>
  He would say, &quot;because anyone who does believe in God is a fool. If <br>
God existed, he would stop this piece of chalk from hitting the ground <br>
and breaking.  Such a simple task to prove that he is God, and yet he <br>
can't do it.&quot; And every year, he would drop the chalk onto the tile <br>
floor of the classroom and it would shatter into a hundred pieces. All <br>
of the students could do nothing but stop and stare. Most of the <br>
students were convinced that God couldn't exist. Certainly, a number <br>
of Christians had slipped through, but for 20 years, they had been too <br>
afraid to stand up. <br>
<br>
    Well, a few years ago, there was a freshman who happened to get <br>
enrolled in the class. He was a Christian, and had heard the stories <br>
about this professor. He had to take the class because it was one of <br>
the required classes for his major. and he was afraid.  But for 3 <br>
months that semester, he prayed every morning that he would have the <br>
courage to stand up no matter what the professor said or what the <br>
class thought. Nothing they said or did could ever shatter his faith, <br>
he hoped. <br>
 <br>
    Finally the day came. The professor said, &quot;If there is anyone here <br>
who still believes in God, stand up!&quot; The professor and the class of <br>
300 people looked at him, shocked, as he stood up at the back of the <br>
classroom. The professor shouted, &quot;You FOOL!! If God existed, he could <br>
keep this piece of chalk from breaking when it hit the ground!&quot; He <br>
proceeded to drop the chalk, but as he did, it slipped out of his <br>
fingers, off his shirt cuff, onto the pleats of his pants, down his <br>
leg, and off his shoe. As it hit the ground, it simply rolled away, <br>
unbroken. The professor's jaw dropped as he stared at the chalk. <br>
He looked up at the young man and then ran out of the lecture hall. <br>
    The young man who had stood up proceeded to walk to the front of <br>
the room and share his faith in Jesus for the next half hour. 300 <br>
students stayed and listened as he told of God's love for them and of <br>
his power through Jesus. <br>
