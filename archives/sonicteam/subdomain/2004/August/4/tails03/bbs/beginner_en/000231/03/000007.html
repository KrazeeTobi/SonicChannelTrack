   &quot;So, where are we off to now, Mr. Land?&quot; inquired Quack, as he held on for dear life in the back-seat of the stolen jeep, &quot;Off to gather more would-be members?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Don't talk to me. I'm driving.&quot; Swazi replied, hastily. He was sweating by the bucketful and his eyes were an unnatural shade of lime-green with black and hazel polka dots.<br>
   &quot;A stop sign erected itself at the end of the street,&quot; sang Rocklobster exuberantly, caressing the burnt orange suitcase, &quot;So the end of the street became a predestined stopping point for passersby...&quot; Llama, who was also hanging on for his life in the back seat of the stolen jeep, glanced quizzically at Swazi.<br>
   &quot;Is he always this... musical?&quot; he asked.<br>
   &quot;Don't talk to me. I'm driving.&quot; replied Swazi, hastily. His grip on the steering wheel was so tight that his hands were turning black due to loss of circulation.<br>
   &quot;He seems to possess the uncanny ability to receive and broadcast radio waves,&quot; Quack explained, nearly tumbling out of the near-tumbling vehicle, &quot;He's a sort of... biological radio, if you will.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Because most people interpret a red flattened hexagonal shape on the end of a pole with big white letters that spell out 'STOP' to signify that they better stop...&quot;<br>
   &quot;If I have to endure anymore of this wretched song,&quot; stated Llama, on the verge of insanity, &quot;then I'll gnaw my arms and legs off and find a creative way to strangle myself with them.&quot;<br>
   &quot;So they do, ain't that just grand?...&quot;<br>
   &quot;You get used to it after a while, I guess,&quot; stated Quack suavely, &quot;I mean, at least he hasn't sucked on your ank--- GOOD GRACIOUS, SWAZI!! THE TANK!!!&quot; In his utter bewilderment, Quack leapt forward and inadvertently elbowed Swazi in the side of the head.<br>
   &quot;Oh sh--&quot; began Swazi, brazenly swerving off to the left and out of the path of the ominous tank that sped by. Three of the four passengers relaxed. One picked up radio signals.<br>
   &quot;I guess that's just the way the world works, and I find it rather odd...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, guys. That was frightening. My bladder just emptied itself.&quot; Swazi declared, rather uncalled for.<br>
   &quot;But I wish I were a camel...&quot;<br>
   &quot;At least we weren't crushed to death by that--- GOOD GRACIOUS, SWAZI!! THE DUMPSTER!!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;In the middle of the road?&quot; The jeep smashed headlong into a dumpster, launching its passengers a mile or so down the street. Rocklobster continued singing the first two thousand six hundred forty feet, but forgot the lyrics, so he hummed the rest of the way.<br>
   A red-hued tank hummed happily down the road. It didn't feel the need to worry about traffic, as it just crunched and flattened every misfortunate car, motorcycle, ice cream truck, roadblock, streetlight, and French timpani player that just happened to feel like getting in its way. The driver particularly enjoyed rush hour. Whenever it came time to turn a nasty little corner, out of sheer laziness, it plowed a new street through the unlucky structure that inadvertently obscured its path. Mainly dental clinics. Now, as I mentioned 450 characters ago, the tank was humming happily down the road. Unfortunately, its happiness was broken by some abrupt engine problems.<br>
   hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br>
   FOOOM!!<br>
   hummmm-sputter-sputter-ptooie-hum-sputter-sputter<br>
   BANG!!<br>
   sizzle<br>
   A steady stream of smoke sifted its way out of the exhaust pipe and entrance hatch, not to mention the underside of the vessel. The hatch flung open with a puff of smoke and out emerged two figures, coughing and sputtering and flailing their arms about.<br>
   &quot;DAG-BLAST IT!!&quot; shouted Finneas, &quot;WE HIT ANOTHER GODFORSAKEN SNAIL!!&quot;<br>
   &quot;Oh, come off it, Finneas,&quot; coughed Rufus. Finneas gave Rufus a rather cold and murderous stare.<br>
   &quot;Come off it?! Come off it!?! We just bought the thing, for goodness sake!! A fine vessel this turned out to be! It has no problem plowing through walls or crawling over cars, but by gum, you put a snail in its path and the thing goes and blows up in your face!&quot;<br>
   &quot;We can always return it,&quot; Rufus reminded sagely, &quot;Just make sure you have the receipt.&quot;
