   Swazi, Rocklobster, Quack, Llama, Rufus and Finneas emerged from the uncomfortably small entrance hatch of the tank. Simultaneously.<br>
   &quot;Hey, thanks for the lift, Finneas. It would've taken us quite a while to get back here if you hadn't smashed through that dental clinic,&quot; praised Quack, &quot;And I got a free toothbrush.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Anything for my new comrades, comrade.&quot; replied Finneas, a hint of arrogance in his voice.<br>
   &quot;Yeah, but we were packed in there like sardines,&quot; Swazi pointed out, &quot;If you had charged us but ten cents for the ride, we'd still be getting ripped off. I mean, not to say I hate tanks. Tanks are a nice commodity for mad drivers such as myself, seeing as they can plow right through the busiest of rush hours, but they're not so much for luxury, are they? I'm just glad I have a jeep to--- MY JEEP!!!!&quot; Swazi stood aghast in the radiance of his- ...technically it wasn't his, but...- once glorious jeep, which was now about half of its original size and smoldering something terrible. Oddly enough, the dumpster wasn't anywhere to be found.<br>
   &quot;Gah! Look at that! I'm gonna kill the person who did this to my jeep!&quot; sputtered Swazi, shaking his fists in rage. Quack looked off a little to the left and attempted to quell a sliver of a smile.<br>
   &quot;If I do recall correctly, was it not you who crashed into the dumpster, or am I hallucinating?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Y, you're delirious!&quot; Swazi sputtered. &quot;(Hm... I guess suicide's on my to-do list again... Why can't I just buckle down and see a psychiatrist?)&quot; A scene flashed before Swazi's eyes:<br>
   &quot;Now, tell me again. Your problem.&quot; commanded the psychiatrist softly.<br>
   &quot;I have to commit suicide, but I don't want to.&quot; Swazi stated.<br>
   &quot;Ah. Oh. Well, uh, tell me about your childhood.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, let's see... My mother wasn't quite married when she conceived me. In fact, she never got married. Never had sexual intercourse, either.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Intriguing...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yeah. She went to a DNA bank and found someone's toenail. No need to go into detail.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Yes. Quite so.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Well, my mother really didn't want to take care of me, so I was shoved into a sock and put out for the milkman to pick up at the age of three And she had a beard...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Really?&quot;<br>
   &quot;And I was raised by a pack of rhinos...&quot;<br>
   &quot;Umm hmm...&quot;<br>
   &quot;And I got a turtle stuck up my nose at age thirteen.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Fascinating.&quot;<br>
   &quot;So. That's it. What's wrong with me?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Huh? Hang on a minute, Harold.&quot; The psychiatrist glanced scornfully at Swazi and put his hand over the receiver of his cell phone. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
   Swazi blinked back to the present, with an answer to his muttered question.<br>
   &quot;That was a rather awkward flashback, wouldn't you say, Swazi?&quot; Quack leered immediately after the cheap and poorly executed scene transition.<br>
   &quot;W-w-what do you mean? Could you see it or something?&quot; Swazi asked hesitantly.<br>
   Quack tried his best to maintain a stern poker face, but he tried a little too much and resembled a man who had been constipated for the last three weeks. &quot;No,&quot; he said in a voice which made him sound like a man who had been constipated for the last three weeks and had a horrendous case of oversized mutant hemorrhoids, producing a sneeze that sounded oddly like mocking laughter afterward. When he asked Llama whether or not he'd seen it, he merely backed away slowly and uttered frantically, &quot;Whoa, you just stay there, pal. Keep your distance.&quot; Finneas didn't even wait for an inquiry. He had something to say, and by gum, he'd say it, regardless of whether or not the rest of them really wanted to hear it.<br>
   &quot;How embarrassing... A turtle? Up your nose? It takes a real idiot to accomplish that feat!! Especially one that's supposedly already a man, by Jewish tradition. So much for that philosophy. I say you're a man when you don't stick large organisms up your nostrils!!&quot; Finneas blasted. Swazi turned to Rufus, reddened by the notion that someone as arrogant as Finneas would be making a jest of his sacred- if not a tad on the bizarre side- memories.
