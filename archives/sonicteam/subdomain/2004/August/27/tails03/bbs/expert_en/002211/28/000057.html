&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You're really nice. A very sweet guy.. Not many of those around.. Heh..<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I try... Im not always nice... just most of the time. Occasionally I get really really really competitive and mean...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well. You're really nice to me. That doesn't happen often with guys.. ..Well.. It never USED to happen often. Now a lot of guys are nice to me. Some just don't acknowledge me.. But.. yeah..<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I try to be nice to intelegent people, hence why I'm not to falcor and Ultra chao (or whatever his name is). People who can't make sense when the want to dont really deserve friendlyness, in my opinon...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I thought it was funny how you insulted him. 'Cuz.. He had it coming!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ^^&quot; Thanks... I dont try to attack newbs... I just wind up doing it accidently. They end up acting stupid, and I point it out, and then they respond with &quot;OMGF!!!111oneoneononeonethree YU HAOR! I LEIK HTAE U SO MUCH CASUE UR STUPOD ND STFF!&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *giggles* That's funny! Oh! That reminds me.. One time.. MK did shit like that.. He was making fun of me for being obsessed with Inuyasha.. And I was like, &quot;Holy fucking hell! PREP ALERT!! EVERYBODY! TO THE PREP SHELTER!! *danananananana!*&quot; And then. I put that in my profile. And we all kept laughing.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lol! Yeah... Inu-yasha is great, although I havent seen that much of it. There's some really great fanfiction out there about it though... (www.iridecesntdreams.net or something close to that. I think I misspelled it. It has great ones.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm always heading to fanfiction.net for some good fics.. Heh. I write my own as well. But they get a bit.. Er.. Lemony.. So.. I don't normally let people read them.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Whats a good fic without a bit of lemon? But yeah. I think thats the url, although you've probably read them at ff.net... <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Heh. My lemons are very lemony. But.. It's all from my head.. And sometimes I believe I might have more testosterone than estrogen (lol a little biology humor)<br>
<br>
Heh. Theres nothing wrong with lemons though. Just dont post them at ff.net, or they delete you.. <br>
<br>
