Yeah, i liked Kenshin's Master's explanation of his ultimate attack.  &quot;If the fangs of the Wind Dragon miss, the intense winds restrict movement, and the claws would surely rip you to shreds.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, i liked Kenshin's Master's explanation of his ultimate attack.  &quot;If the fangs of the Wind Dragon miss, the intense winds restrict movement, and the claws would surely rip you to shreds.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *nod nod* and i notice a lot of the girls are attarcted to him. sure, he's attractive and all, but not as attractive as Kenshin and Sanosuke. XD!!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i'm not the one to ask in that department.... believe you me. Yay horrible grammar!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Seggy said the same thing. lol... and ya, agree to the horrible grammer does i.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; And you never see Jin-ei!  Dammit!  Of course, i get like three seconds of him every episode... in the closing.  He's the first image you see.<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you wouldn't really need to watch the next episode... so my logic's off.  I don't see you offering any explanations!!!  lol<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; X3 well, the battle was good at least... didn't expect him to kill Yumi, though..<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah, but when she ran towards him, i figured she was gonna die.  Someone woulda killed her, and i don't think Kenshin woulda.    oh well.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, i liked Kenshin's Master's explanation of his ultimate attack.  &quot;If the fangs of the Wind Dragon miss, the intense winds restrict movement, and the claws would surely rip you to shreds.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *nod nod* and i notice a lot of the girls are attarcted to him. sure, he's attractive and all, but not as attractive as Kenshin and Sanosuke. XD!!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i'm not the one to ask in that department.... believe you me. Yay horrible grammar!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seggy said the same thing. lol... and ya, agree to the horrible grammer does i.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And you never see Jin-ei!  Dammit!  Of course, i get like three seconds of him every episode... in the closing.  He's the first image you see.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; yep. but then again, he did die... =&gt;.o= ... hey, they put Yu Yu back on. yatta~!!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; yay... Damn!  I'm the only one with a character that dies! *sad anime eyes*  My friend has Kenshin, another has Saito, I have Jin-ei, and my little brother has Yahiko!  AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S DEAD!!!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Oh well, my character is quite important.<br>
<br>
*anime sweatdrop* ... er... *looks at personality quiz* ... sorry, but i'm Sano. *shot* =^-^;= and yes, he very much was important.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you wouldn't really need to watch the next episode... so my logic's off.  I don't see you offering any explanations!!!  lol<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; X3 well, the battle was good at least... didn't expect him to kill Yumi, though..<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah, but when she ran towards him, i figured she was gonna die.  Someone woulda killed her, and i don't think Kenshin woulda.    oh well.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, i liked Kenshin's Master's explanation of his ultimate attack.  &quot;If the fangs of the Wind Dragon miss, the intense winds restrict movement, and the claws would surely rip you to shreds.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *nod nod* and i notice a lot of the girls are attarcted to him. sure, he's attractive and all, but not as attractive as Kenshin and Sanosuke. XD!!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i'm not the one to ask in that department.... believe you me. Yay horrible grammar!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seggy said the same thing. lol... and ya, agree to the horrible grammer does i.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And you never see Jin-ei!  Dammit!  Of course, i get like three seconds of him every episode... in the closing.  He's the first image you see.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yep. but then again, he did die... =&gt;.o= ... hey, they put Yu Yu back on. yatta~!!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yay... Damn!  I'm the only one with a character that dies! *sad anime eyes*  My friend has Kenshin, another has Saito, I have Jin-ei, and my little brother has Yahiko!  AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S DEAD!!!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh well, my character is quite important.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *anime sweatdrop* ... er... *looks at personality quiz* ... sorry, but i'm Sano. *shot* =^-^;= and yes, he very much was important. <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; let's see... brady is sano here.  Brady's like sixth or seventh grade.  AND HIS CHARACTER IS ALIVE DAMMIT!  I'll bet my character isn't even on the personality quiz... he isn't around long enough to have a personality!  wahhh!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And i get Bolt Gundam! DAMN DAMN DAMN!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; uhm... i'll see if i can find one fer ya.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; well just gimmie the address for the site.<br>
