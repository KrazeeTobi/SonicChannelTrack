Sometimes I really wanna be alone... but that's one state I'm never in... because I know that I've got millions and millions... of tiny white-celled organisms livin' on my skin! Germs. I scrub and scrub until my flesh is red and bleeding! Germs. But they just come right back again! ... Germs. Can't even see 'em but I know they're up to something! Germs. Hey, don't touch that, you don't know where it's been! They're all over me! They're inside of me! Can't get 'em offa me! I'm covered with.. microscopic bacteria. What do they want from me!? What'll they do to me!? There's no escape for me! I'm covered with.. microscopic bacteria. Now if I get to go to sleep... that's when they start the sneak attack. In the mornin', I wake up in utter horror, to find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque. Can't get those parasetic creatures off my face! And there's more comin' every day! I never said that they could count them on my body. I wish they'd take they're tiny little bags and move away. They're all over me! Th <br>
