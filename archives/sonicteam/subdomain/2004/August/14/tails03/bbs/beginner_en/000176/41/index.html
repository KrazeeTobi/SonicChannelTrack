Spyke the Silver Echidna: Part six<br>
<br>
There was the sound of footsteps in the hall.  And they were getting closer by the second.  &quot;Quick, hide!&quot; said Spyke.  &quot;There's no hiding places here!&quot; Said Knuckles.  &quot;Oh yes there is.&quot; said Tails.  With that, he grabed Sonic and Knuckles, flew up into the air, and grabbed a lamp.  Sonic and Knuckles grabbed a lamp next to him.  A tall, thin man walked into the room.  He had dark brown hair and even darker shades.  &quot;Are you ready?&quot;  He said to Spyke.  &quot;Get away from me!  Where's my friends?!?&quot; Cried Spyke.  &quot;Right here.&quot; said the man.  He took a few steps to the left.  There was a coat rack, with SILVER coats hanging on it.  Spyke screamed.  Sonic screamed.  Tails screamed.  Even Knuckles screamed.  The man looked up.  He had found them!  Knuckles knew that it was now or never.  He jumped to the ground, knocked the man over, and punched right through the wall on Spyke's cage.  &quot;Lets get out of here!&quot;  He shouted.  The four friends ran away as fast as possible.  When they were absaloutly sure they were safe, they collapsed onto the ground.  Spyke was sobbing.  Knuckles tried to make her feel better. &quot;Spyke,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm really really sorry that we couldn't save your family and friends.&quot;  Spyke just walked off into the forest.  &quot;Spyke, wait!&quot; shouted Knuckles.<br>
<br>
later:<br>
<br>
Spyke came back with a bunch of wood and leaves.  She used them to build a hut.  Then she went inside, covering the door with a big leaf.  &quot;She needs some time alone.&quot; Knuckles told his friends.  &quot;Mabe she'll feel better in the morning.&quot;...<br>
