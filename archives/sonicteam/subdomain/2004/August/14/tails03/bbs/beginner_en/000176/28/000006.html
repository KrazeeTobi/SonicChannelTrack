&gt; &gt; Spyke the Silver Echidna: part five (long story, huh?)<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Last time: Just read chapter four if you don't know!<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Sonic, Knuckles and Tails had just reached a big building.  There was a sign on the front.  It said 'Fancy Furs Co.'  &quot;Come on.  Spyke must be in there.&quot; said Knuckles.  &quot;You know, this is really unlike you, Knux.  You never try so hard to help someone.&quot; Said Sonic. &quot;Yeah.  Are you okay?&quot; asked Tails.  &quot;Well, I...  I only...  It's because...&quot; Stammered Knuckles.  &quot;Do you like her or something?&quot; asked Sonic.  &quot;Well, I mean..  She's nice, but..&quot; ansered Knuckles.  &quot;I mean, do you LIKE like her?&quot; said Sonic.  &quot;Well..&quot; said Knuckles. &quot;..Forget it.  We don't have time to sit here and talk like this.&quot; With that, he raced off, looking for a way into the building.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; a few minutes later:<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Hey, look!  This window's open!&quot; Said Knuckles.  &quot;We can get inside!&quot;  He slipped through the window, followed by Sonic and Tails.  &quot;Now that we're in, where do we find Spyke?&quot; asked Tails.  A sign was above them.  &quot;Let's see...  Foxes are to the left.. minks.. leopards.. Aha!  Echidnas are this way!&quot; said Knuckles, pointing to a path.  The three heros ran down the path as fast as they could.  There was a cage with lots of echidnas in it.  At least, there USED to be lots of echidnas in it.  Now, Spyke was the only one there.  &quot;Spyke!  Are you okay?&quot; Asked Knuckles.  &quot;I'm fine.&quot; Ansered Spyke. &quot;Where are all the others?&quot; asked Sonic.  &quot;Well, some ugly guy took them away.  He was going to take me to, but he couldn't deal with all of us at once.  He said, 'when I'm done with your friends, I'll come back for you.'  You guys gotta get me out of here!&quot; Cried Spyke.  &quot;Quick, hide!  I think he's coming!&quot;...<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; To be continued...<br>
