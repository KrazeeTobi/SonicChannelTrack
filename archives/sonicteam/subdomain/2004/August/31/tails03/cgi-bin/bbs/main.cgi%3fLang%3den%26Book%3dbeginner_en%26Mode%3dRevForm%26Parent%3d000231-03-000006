<TEXTAREA NAME="Text" COLS="60" ROWS="6" WRAP="VIRTUAL">The clerk pulled out a shotgun and blasted numerous holes through the salesmen, who had to be shot again before they realized they were dead. They all stood there aimlessly and stared at what could've been classified as lifeless corpses.
   &quot;I think I'll take tater tots,&quot; decided Llama casually. The clerk punched the numbers in on the register and handed him a small cardboard box with some fries in it. &quot;Thanks much, sir.&quot;
   &quot;Don't forget your receipt,&quot; reminded the cashier, handing him the receipt. Llama's face went blank. It was odd, but everyone present could have sworn that the cashier made a huge emphasis on the word receipt, so it sounded like &quot;reeeeeeeeeeeeceeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipppppppttttttttttt.&quot;
  &quot;Re........ceipt....?&quot; he asked, clutching the receipt uncertainly. He looked at the receipt. He looked at the receipt again. He looked at the receipt again to make sure he had been looking at a receipt the first two times. A fire kindled in his eyes. &quot;RECEIPT!!!&quot; he shouted. He grabbed the register and inconveniently flung it through another unbroken window, causing it to fly thirty feet and break down an ice cream truck that just happened to be driving by. It wasn't possible for him to do this again, but by gum, he did it again anyway, shattering yet another window and breaking down yet another ice cream truck that just happened to be driving by. He grabbed a plastic spoon and began beating the tar out of the receipt. Swazi saw an opportunity at hand, but failed to realize it, so Quack realized it for him. He trotted over to Llama.
   &quot;Excuse me, Mr....&quot; began Quack.
   &quot;RECEIPT! RECEIPT!! RECEIPT!!!&quot; shouted Llama, blinded by his inscrutable fury.
   &quot;Uhm, sir...&quot;
   &quot;RECEIPT! RECEIPT!! RECEIPT!!!&quot;
   &quot;Hello?&quot;
   &quot;RECEIPT! RECEIPT!! RECEIPT!!!&quot; Quack calmly walked over to the cashier.
   &quot;May I borrow your shotgun?&quot; he asked politely. The cashier handed it to him. He walked over to where Llama was battering the receipt. He carelessly aimed the gun at the receipt and fired, eradicating all that was a receipt and the end of the plastic spoon. Llama froze, staring at the black crater where the receipt had been, momentarily glancing at the bit of smoldering plastic that was burning a hole through his hand. Quack leaned on the shotgun.
   &quot;So, you look like you have a lot of energy. And you seem to be quite the combatant when it comes to... receipts,&quot; A slight convulsion from Llama. &quot;We could use your skills, sir. How would you like to join our little resistance movement? We're gonna overthrow the giraffes and Mr. Cheese! Doesn't that sound entertaining?&quot;
   &quot;It sounds like suicide.&quot; retorted Llama flatly. A slight convulsion from Quack.
   &quot;Well, er...&quot;
   &quot;And now that I actually sit down and listen to the word 'SUICIDE,' I find that I think the word sounds pretty cool. Sure, I'll help with your dairy/longneck extermination.&quot;
   &quot;Hey, guys?&quot; bellowed Swazi, &quot;Could ya help me out here? I've fallen in glass and I can't get up, and it's really painful, and I'm sure that the glass thinks so, too.&quot;
   &quot;Oh, that's you over there?&quot; replied Quack, &quot;I thought you were that hideous thing over there, with the burnt orange suitcase and shotgun holes. You do sort of look like it...&quot;
   &quot;Ha ha. You're a riot. A real stand up kinda guy. Now, HELP ME UP HELP ME UP HELP ME UP!!!!&quot;
   &quot;Tsk tsk, Gifford,&quot; reprimanded Rocklobster, &quot;Playing in the glass again. How many times do I have to swing a sack of potatoes in Berlin before you realize that glass is not your friend? No beans for you, young man!&quot; Swazi decided he better come up with a particularly clever retort to counter Rocklobster's mockery.
   &quot;...?&quot; was as far as he got.
   After a while, they did eventually help him up.
   And the glass was very thankful.
   I might also mention that Rocklobster acquired the burnt orange suitcase and took it back with him, mistaking it for a bowl of fruit.
