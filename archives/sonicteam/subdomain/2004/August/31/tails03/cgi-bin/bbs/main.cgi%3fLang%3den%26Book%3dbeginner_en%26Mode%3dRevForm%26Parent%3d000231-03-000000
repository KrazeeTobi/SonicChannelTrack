<TEXTAREA NAME="Text" COLS="60" ROWS="6" WRAP="VIRTUAL"> 1   After a long-winded campaign to end all long-winded campaigns, which we will not go into long-winded explanations of due to the fact that there are no long-winded explanations relative to the subject of this particular long-winded campaign, the nations of the world dissolved their individuality, united, and simply called their new worldwide country &quot;The Earth&quot; (on a short-winded note, the major leaders of the world decided, rather than sorting out their differences with violence and bloodshed, to engage in a pleasant game of checkers). For once in the Earth's miserable history, every last inhabitant, including tax collectors, found peace, joy, and an inscrutable attraction to various types of fruitcake.
   But suddenly, out of nowhere, Mr. Cheese single-handedly enslaved the Earth and made giraffes the dominant species.
   This brings this particular narrative up to date.

   Swazi was of the rebellious sort. In fact, he rebelled just for the gratification rebelling squelched out of him, even if he didn't necessarily disagree with what he was rebelling against. One day, as he sat on a fallen tree in a park somewhere and watched, not necessarily disgusted with the fact, everyone peacefully coping with Mr. Cheese's dominion over them, not to mention the sudden inferiority to giraffes, the urge to rebel surged forth, encompassing every ounce of his being. He ended up inadvertently punching out an innocent passerby wearing a giraffe-skin colored coat in this sudden urge and, being rebellious, refusing to apologize. He was struck with the ideal, not necessarily one he agreed with, that someone should overthrow Mr. Cheese and return the Earth to its former stature. His mind was set. He would be that someone, he would be the Earth's hero. Feeling good about his new ideal, he burned the tree he had sat on and left it utterly unattended as he did, just to be rebellious.
   After about three minutes of scampering about burning things, he decided he'd need some allies, as he didn't stand a chance alone. Those giraffes were quite incessant in their superiority, and wouldn't be taken down easily, especially because of those long necks. If he talked to people about his ideal, he'd be in a nice soft room with a comfy new jacket within seconds. Nobody was so stupid as to go up against the giraffes, for they had long necks. He stomped the ground and cursed those hideous long necks. He decided he'd just play it cool for now. Lay low and watch, wait for idiots crazy enough to fight against long necks. He ran through the park and hid in a trash can, the perfect watching and waiting point for idiots and insanity and the dislike of long necks.
   He spent three years in that trash can. Three rather long, disheartening years.
   But his luck finally showed up, and apologized for its late arrival, as it had had a bit of trouble finding the aisle with the eggs in it at the supermarket. He assured his luck that there was nothing to apologize for and invited it into his trash can for some foolish sap's half-drunk soda and a bit of old tire.
   Simultaneously and at the same time, the revered but often times forgotten Quarkle Urkin Arklin Carmen Kaiser, or Quack, for an acronymic nickname, just happened to be passing through that same park for no apparent reason. And when he passed through that park, he was utterly determined to pass through that park with the utmost lack of reason in the utmost revered-but-often-forgotten way imaginable. Alas, an insane asylum escapee ruined his goal and rather brazenly, or brainlessly, whichever one you prefer, hindered his progress by grappling onto his ankle and acting as though he was picking up radio signals.
   &quot;I say, you fool! Release my ankle!&quot;
   &quot;Have you ever bought a kitten, but then realized that you actually bought a frying pan? At Persimmod's Kitten-But-Actually-A-Frying-Pan clinic, we take great pride in saying, 'You're a moron. A complete imbecile.'&quot;
   &quot;I say! Let go of my ankle!&quot;
   &quot;Buy now and you get another glove absolutely free, even if you don't particularly need it! We sure don't!&quot;</TEXTAREA></TD>
