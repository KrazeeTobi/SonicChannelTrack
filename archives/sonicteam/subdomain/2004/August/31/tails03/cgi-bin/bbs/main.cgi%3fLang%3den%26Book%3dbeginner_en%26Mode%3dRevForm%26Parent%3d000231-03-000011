   &quot;The thing that really gets me is... Well... I thought rhinoceroses were solitary creatures,&quot; Rufus replied sagely, &quot;How, then, could you be raised by a herd of them? That is truly a noteworthy phenomenon, as it is completely illogical. The rhinocerouses would most likely be miles apart from one another! But I guess that illogical principles is what this whole book is founded on, right? Giraffes dominating the world, tanks zipping down busy streets, fish repairing things... Oh, there's so much left not to comprehend.&quot; A gigantic purple spoon drifted its way past the motley group of Anti-Cheese rebels, promptly exploding into a thousand tiny tap-dancing Mexicans further down the street. Swazi looked pleadingly at Rocklobster, completely oblivious of the illogical phenomenon that took place not two seconds earlier.
   &quot;You too?&quot; he squeaked.
   &quot;Frankfuurt the iguana wrote a thank you note on my forehead, Gifford. Isn't that nice of him? I think I should buy him a flying lawyer.&quot;
   &quot;Er... Just for the sake of sanity- which you so determinedly and thoroughly obliterated- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.&quot;
   Suddenly, out of nowhere, an old man with a banjo and a pair of suave sunglasses that didn't at all match his haggard appearance materialized inside Swazi's crumpled stolen jeep. Without so much as glancing at the motley band of would-be revolutionaries, he started the ignition. It was as though it were his entire life's purpose to take Swazi's taken car.
   &quot;HEY!! What're ya doing!?!?&quot; Swazi shouted at the enigmatic old coot, &quot;That's my jeep!! I worked my liver off trying to get that thing, and like any honest, hardworking man, that means I stole it!!&quot; The old man in the car turned his head towards Swazi, winked like a bizarre little hermit who made a point out of materializing inside of broken down cars and then stealing them like it were perfectly natural for him to do so and that the lot of them were quite ignorant and foolish to be standing around wondering why in blazes an old man would just come out of thin air and take possession of their car, and then promptly drove off.
   &quot;Wow,&quot; Llama said breathlessly, struck dumb by the utter irrelevance of the phenomenal previous scene, &quot;Those were some nice sunglasses!&quot;
   &quot;Well... It's sardine time again!&quot; Rufus exclaimed cheerily, pointing at the tank, &quot;I get dibs on the top of the pile.&quot;

   Harold convulsed violently and pulled the towel more closely to his overly-moist body. He swirled his feet around in the large bucket of lukewarm water, realizing that it was supposed to be steaming hot. He sniffled a few times, hoping to catch someone's attention so they could rectify the dilemma. When that didn't work, he forced a fake, yet audible snort, which sent him into a real cacophonous snorting fit that would even put the patients with the worst cases of Whooping Cough to shame. Even after he regained the proper function of his lungs and nostrils, still, nobody noticed him. Finally, he thought he'd get attention the old fashioned way.
   &quot;YOUR COUSIN WATCHES EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION!!!!!&quot;
   Sure enough, he had a buzzing swarm of footwear store employees buzzing about him like a swarm of buzzing swarm buzzers that resembled footwear store employees. He coughed.
   &quot;Yeah. My water's too cold. Make it hot.&quot; He demanded.</TEXTAREA></TD>
