by the way read this:<br>

 Since Leo loves first with the heart and Gemini with the mind, this combination will soon find out that they are probably totally unsuited to each other. On the surface, there is likely to be great deal of mutual attraction. However, before much time passes, the passionate Leo is sure to clash with the unreasonable Gemini, who will undoubtedly complain that the Leo nature is too material, too possessive and far too demanding. Nevertheless, despite these drawbacks, there is reason for optimism regarding this pairing. If Leo is able to understand that Gemini may not always be around to provide the attention upon which this sign thrives...and Gemini can understand Leo's need to run the world...then this mixture of air and fire can prove to be a good one.<br>
<br>
Not altogether a bad blend, the Gemini/Leo combination can complement one another. Generous Leo is usually willing to bend in whatever direction is needed...provided flattery leads the way...and both individuals possess a somewhat childlike, playful and fun-loving side which surfaces easily when they are together. There is also a mutual appreciation of drama and color, and each finds the other to be delightful and interesting in many areas. Nevertheless, Leo will invariably have difficulty in completely comprehending Gemini's desire for novelty, since it is inherent in the Leo character to make a committment and keep to it. In addition, Leo is a very proud sign with a sensitive ego and Gemini can be a merciless teaser, frequently not taking Leo seriously enough. On the Gemini side, Leo will most probably demand more adoration than Gemini is willing to give. Thus, though not necessarily the best blend in a romantic sense, the Gemini/Leo combination usually makes for an excellent friendship and will be an affectionate pairing between two people who truly enjoy each other's company and have many wonderful times together.
