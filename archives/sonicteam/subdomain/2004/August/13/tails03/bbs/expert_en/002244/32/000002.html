The lost chao is this. <br>
<br>
A. T A I L S<br>
Upgrades needed : none<br>
<br>
There is nothing to do in Tails' level so work your way through it like you <br>
ordinary would.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
B. E G G M A N<br>
Upgrades needed : Jet Engine<br>
                  Large Cannon<br>
                  Mystic Melody<br>
<br>
Straight after checkpoint 2, there is a small platform you must land on to go<br>
below, but instead of going on it, you will need to reach the door to the other<br>
side. Hover to that door. You might have to hover from the ramp to the door to<br>
reach it. Once you reach it, break the metal boxes and keep going on to the <br>
ancient shrine. Play mystic melody and a shield capsule will appear behind you.<br>
That's all ? Yep, that's all. Now make your way to the end of the level.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
C. R O U G E<br>
Upgrades needed : Mystic Melody<br>
<br>
Eggman has opened a new path for Rouge now. At the beginning, turn left and you<br>
will notice there is a new open path now. Normally, there was a door here. At<br>
the end of the tunnel is an ancient shrine so play mystic melody and a shield <br>
capsule will appear. That's all for Rouge. Finish her level now.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
D. K N U C K L E S<br>
Upgrades needed : Mystic Melody<br>
<br>
Rouge has made floating platforms appeared for Knuckles now. Leave the water<br>
area and go to the security door near Omochao (the one you must open to finish<br>
the level). There are now floating platforms next to it leading to a hole in <br>
the ceiling. Jump and you will grab a pulley. Once in the tunnel, you will see <br>
an ancient shrine so play mystic melody to make a magnet shield capsule appear.<br>
That's it. Take the pulley down and go open that security door to finish <br>
knuckles' level.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
E. S O N I C<br>
Upgrades needed : Light Shoes<br>
<br>
The last and hardest part. You start from sliding down a pole. Once you slide<br>
down the second pole near the end of the level, you will fall on a kind of <br>
yellow waterslide. Knuckles should have made a row of rings appeared on top of <br>
the waterfall. Press B while near it to light dash through that line of rings.<br>
It can be hard because of the water flow (it took me a few tries...). While<br>
light dashing through the rings, hold the stick FORWARD to land on a platform.<br>
Destroy the two blue enemies on this platform to open the door. Watch out for<br>
the three robot enemies inside and finally pick your lost chao.<br>
<br>
Ancient light: Item: Ancient Light<br>
Location: Sky Rail<br>
Requirements: None<br>
What It Does: Allows you to use the Light Attack.  The Light Attack allows<br>
              you to attack enemies in a quick row.<br>
Difficulty: Medium-Hard<br>
<br>
How To Get:  Not as hard as it seems. Proceed through the level as normal<br>
             until you get to the first rocket.  DO NOT take this rocket, but<br>
             instead homing attack the enemy over to the ledge with the chao<br>
             box.  Walk over and break the chao box.  Tiptoe over to the edge<br>
             and get as close to the mountain as you can.  A row of baddies<br>
             should appear.  Homing attack them and then homing attack the<br>
             final one with the spring to get to the top of the mountain and<br>
             the Ancient Light upgrade.<br>
