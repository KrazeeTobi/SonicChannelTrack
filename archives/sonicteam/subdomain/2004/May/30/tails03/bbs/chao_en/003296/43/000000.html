The New World: part 6<br>
<br>
&quot;Charge!&quot; Shouted Zimbarii and the Chaos chao at once.  Chao warriors from both sides started fighting.  They used all kinds of weapons.  Zimbarii picked up his sword and joined in the battle.  Illusen lifted her mace up high.  Then she swung it around in circles, sending evil chao flying.<br>
<br>
Emily knew that she had to fight too.  She picked up her spear and prepared to rush into the battle, but then something happened...<br>
<br>
Emily went into a blue cacoon!  &quot;I'm... evolving!&quot; She thought.  While she was in that cacoon, time seemed to stop.  After a couple of minutes, she emerged from the caccoon.  But she wasn't a hero flying chao, like she had been before.  She had become an angel chaos chao!<br>
<br>
Emily felt faster, stronger then before.  She picked up her spear, (which she had dropped when she went into the caccoon) and rushed into the battle.<br>
<br>
One by one, the evil chao were defeated.  Eventually, only their leader was left.  Zimbarii tried to attack, but Emily held him back.  &quot;Let me take care of this.&quot;  She slowly approached the devil chaos chao.<br>
<br>
When she was about three feet away from him, she took out her spear.  She was just about to attack, when...<br>
<br>
Tails was fixing the last few glitches in the chao garden.  &quot;Only a couple more...&quot; He said.<br>
<br>
...Suddenly, the devil chao changed.  His torn wings were replaced with regular dark chao wings.  His fangs disapeared, and his horns shrank.  He looked down at himself and said, &quot;The glitch... it's... GONE...&quot;  Emily stopped.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Those dragons... the ones that made us this way, were a glitch.  Apparently, the glitch was just fixed.  Oh, I feel so good!&quot; He smiled.  After a short silence, he said, &quot;...I'm going home now.&quot;  And with that said, he left.<br>
<br>
Tails fixed the very last glitch.  &quot;There,&quot; he said.  &quot;Finally finished.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess it's over.&quot; said Emily.  Zimbarii and Illusen nodded.  as they went back into the cave, it rained for the first time in chao garden...<br>
