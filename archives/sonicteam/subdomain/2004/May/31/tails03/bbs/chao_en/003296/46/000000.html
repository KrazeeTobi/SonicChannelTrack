O.k. Kiara you run back down to chao vegas i'll run to the movie's and kirby you go to the comic store so everybody ran to their place's but the only one that found her was chao lover then he ran as fast as he could and grabbed her and ran away then he started to talk to her, then he told her that he was her brother then after he told her that she was shocked, then chao lover asked her does she still have the emerald's from the last time he saw her when they were kid's then pinky said yes then chao lover said that we have to go get kiara the chao and kirby then after they got them they went to chao lover's mansion so while they were at chao lover's mansion they went into the emerald room then they combined the emeralds and turned into the legendary super chao and had the ability to go invisible so after that they went flying and started fighting in the air, while they all were having fun the legendary chao flew right by and hit chao lover then chao lover was about to land on some spikes. (will this be the end of chao lover or not?)<br>
