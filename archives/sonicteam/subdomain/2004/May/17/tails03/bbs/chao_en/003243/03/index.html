first of all, I'm older than I look. This body may be new, but my memories are as old as time... I cannot die, immortal I guess you could call me. when my body becomes too old I am simply reborn. You may know me by my three tails. I'm always born with three tails. Anyway, on to the story...<br>
<br>
when I was born my fur was the color of snow. My name... what was the name my parents gave me? I have forgotten it. I've gone by many names in the past, but this one suits me well. Anyway, my parents only had me, so I had no siblings to play with. Everyone in my pack was very close. We all loved each other. Even the pain of losing my parents to old age was deadend by their love for me. That's when he came. The new leader of the pack. He was as bright as the sun, his fur as well as his charm. I grew fond of him, all the girls did. I was young, naive, stupid to give my heart away. I found out that I was just another pretty face to him, nothing more. It broke my heart.<br>
<br>
I ran away, crying my pain to the forest. But then horrible creatures, humans I later found out, captured me. They had bad intentions for me. Then I saw my pack come out of the forest. They would save me, or so I thought. The leader looked at me for a moment, then went back into the forest. The others followed. I had been betrayed.<br>
<br>
I will not go into that part of my life, it is better forgotten. When I escaped, I was vengeful. If my pack would forget me so easily, I would have no pity to them or any other wolf. I led the humans into the forest. They captured and killed two packs, and still I lead them on. There was only one pack I wanted to see destroyed, my own.<br>
<br>
We found them. I watched with pleasure as each one, even the hansome leader, fell before the traps. But what I didn't know was that the magical guardians of the wolves had been watching me, and were angry with my deeds.<br>
<br>
I will remember that day until Earth is nothing but a dried out shell and I am the last to survive it's doom. The guardians told me that I would be punished. Half-heartedly, I begged them not to. But the guardians knew I didn't believe my own words. So it was beyond forgivness to them. They spun around me until I was dizzy. Then they slowed, and stopped. At first, nothing happened. then the enchantment began to take affect.<br>
<br>
My coat was changed for starters. It was stripped of it's white and blossomed into violets and greens. But the enchantment did not stop there. I felt a tearing at the tip of my tail. Transfixed, I turned and looked. I watched in horror as my tail split into two, then three. Three tails, three betrayles, one curse. I was granted immortality.<br>
<br>
Now I must bear my punishment. I am doomed to wander the world alone, forever.<br>
<br>
the end. Were you expecting a happy ending?<br>
<br>
Sorry, happiness died a long time ago, along with my hope of ever being released from this curse. The only thing that grants me peace now is to know that my pack paid. That I will never regret doing.
