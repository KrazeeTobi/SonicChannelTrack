Once upon a time inside of Chao World, three Chao lay bored on they’re heads. Isutan is a male Silver Shadow Chao. Trifire is a male Hero Rabbit Chao. Furina is a female Oracle Chao. But something is different about this Chao World. It’s located inside the newest game, “Sonic Infinite”! Everything has changed since the old “Sonic Adventure 2 Battle”. There are new Chao types, new Animals, and even new gardens! And the story starts out in the garden of peace…<br>
Isutan: “I’m bored!”<br>
Furina: “Me too!”<br>
Trifire: “Me Three!”<br>
Isutan: “Let’s go do something fun.”<br>
Trifire: “OK!” *goes behind tree and wets it*<br>
Furina: “Eww…”<br>
Isutan: “I said FUN not relaxing!”<br>
Furina: “Let’s get out of this boring old “Peace” garden!”<br>
Isutan: “I know what to do!” *Chao ball becomes exclamation mark*<br>
Furina/Trifire: “What is it? I’m so bored!”<br>
Furina/Trifire: “Whoa, 2 people talking the same thing. Déjà Vu.”<br>
Isutan: “Would you 2 shutup? I was trying to say, we should go to the White Jungle!”<br>
Trifire: “White Jungle? Why there?”<br>
Isutan: ”Cause its fun there! I’ll zip over there with my super-speedy legs without you two slow-pokes if you don’t hurry up!”<br>
Furina: “Okay, we’ll go there!”<br>
Trifire: “But… How do we get out of this Garden? It’s so big!”<br>
Isutan: “Let’s just follow our nose, wherever it goes!”<br>
They traveled north for about 15 minutes and suddenly a Blitz Chao appeared in front of them. “Who are you?” Isutan said. “I am the last Chao that your pathetic eyes will ever see!” “Okay guys, you better sit this one out.” Isutan laughed at the Blitz Chao. “What are you laughing about? I’m about to tear your head off and you think that’s funny? Ha! Lets see what you say or if you can even say anything when I obliterate you into nothing but a worthless pile of ashes. My name is Extion, and I’m going to kick your butt!” Isutan dashed towards Extion and threw a punch, but Extion guarded, with a very powerful kick to Isutan’s stomach soon after. “Ughhh…” Isutan winded up for a spin kick, but it was already too late before Extion grabbed his leg and flipped him upwards, landing him on his back. “Something’s not right… I know I can take this freak… Uhhh…” Soon after saying this, Isutan fainted.<br>
Furina: “Isutan! Hang in there, we’re coming!”<br>
Trifire: “You freak! That’s my friend your messin with and I’m coming for you!”<br>
Furina and Trifire charged towards Isutan. “Isutan? Isutan! Are you OK?” Furina said frustratingly. “Here, I’m going to heal you” Furina started to use her healing powers to bring Isutan back to conscious. “I didn’t know you had healing powers, Furina!” Trifire said surprised. “No time for that right now, you have to fight off Extion while I heal Isutan! Now Go!”<br>
Will Trifire be able to fight off Extion while Furina heals Isutan? Will Isutan make it? Or will Extion destroy them like he said he would? Find out next time, on Part 2 Of: Chao Legend Adventure!
