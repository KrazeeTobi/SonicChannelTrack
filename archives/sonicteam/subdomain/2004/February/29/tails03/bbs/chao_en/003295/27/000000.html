The New World: part 3<br>
<br>
Emily decided to go exploring.  She was suprised, because this garden was so much bigger then the one she was in before!  It seemed to go on for miles!  Eventually, she got tired, and lay down to take a nap.<br>
<br>
While she was sleeping, two strange chao walked by.  One was light green, and had fairy wings.  The other was striped, like a zebra.  The fairy chao stopped walking.  she pointed over at Emily.  &quot;Look over there... a new chao.&quot;  the zebra chao looked at Emily.  &quot;I've never seen that chao in the garden before...&quot;<br>
<br>
The two chao went to get a better look at Emily.  &quot;Maybe she's lost.&quot;  Said the fairy chao.  &quot;Maybe...&quot; Replied the zebra chao.  &quot;Let's take her to the cave.&quot;  the fairy chao nodded.<br>
<br>
When Emily woke up, she was in a dark cave.  The two chao had been watching her, but the zebra chao had fallen asleep.  the fairy chao nudged him and said, &quot;Zimbarii, the new chao's waking up!&quot;  The zebra chao blinked.  &quot;Huh?&quot; He mumbled.  &quot;...Oh yeah, the new chao.&quot;  He waved to Emily.  &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; He said.  Emily stood up.  &quot;Who're you guys?  How did I get here?&quot;<br>
<br>
The fairy chao said, &quot;I'm Illusen the pixie chao, and this is my brother, Zimbarii the zebra chao.&quot;  Emily stared.  &quot;Pixie chao?  Zebra chao?  I've never heard of either.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zimbarii whispered to Illusen.  &quot;She must be from the old gardens...&quot; Illusen nodded slowly.  Zimbarii said to Emily, &quot;You're lucky that we found you.  There's danger in these gardens.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ball over Emily's head turned into a question mark.  &quot;Danger?&quot; She asked.  &quot;What kind of danger?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; Said Illusen.  &quot;There are bad chao around here.  I'll explain...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Two years ago, a group of chao found a new type of small animal.  A dragon, but not like the cute dragons that you know of.  No, these dragons were ugly, with torn wings, rough, ragged scales, bright red eyes, and venom dripping from their fangs.  The chao collected as many as they could.  They played with the little dragons, but something happened.  The chao also became ugly.  But that wasn't all.  They also became ferocious.  They would attack and kill any chao that wasn't like them.  Eventually, they formed a clan.  Now they search for chao every day, and kill them.  We brought you to this cave so you would be safe from them.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Illusen finished her story, Zimbarii cut in.  &quot;Hopefully, they won't find us here in this cave.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;But... what if they do?&quot; Whimpered Emily.<br>
<br>
&quot;If they do...&quot; Zimbarii said.  &quot;We'll be ready.&quot;<br>
