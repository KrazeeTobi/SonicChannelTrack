&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh my dear God, this place is pathetic...Ever since I left before you morons have destroyed this place. Thank God I did not stay here and I didn't have to put up with this...All I can say is that some people here seriously have problems and you are all pathetic...Well, that is all I had to say, so goodbye...and by the way, have fun in this moronic place that is almost identical to Hell...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Heh...goodbye!*Hypershadow608 IP bans Anna Kyoyama*<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moron...So much for IP banning me...bwhahahaha...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HAHAHAHAHAHA! YOU RETARDED ANAL PLUG!You really are a bitchy whore! I already reported you. Soon ST will ban! Now leave like you said you would!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hahahahaha...you moronic fool...are those really the best insults you can come up with? And by the way, I did absolutley nothing to break the rules...all I said was that this place is screwed and there is nothing that can help this place so it gets better...you cannot simply get me banned for no reason...and plus I will leave, but it is really pathetic how you can lie to me, and turn everyone against me, and say mean things about me behind my back. That is the worse thing anyone can ever do and I could never forgive you, even if you do apologise, which you won't since you are such an insensitive jerk...So, goodbye, you demented fool. Go burn in hell...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have already been in Hell. And I have never said anything bad behind your back becasue I have always changed what I have said. Give me one time I have said something bad behind your back. NEVER. I can see now that you have turned heartless. I don't know what set you off and made you hate me. I have never lied about you. I have always fought for you. Also, I, of all the people, would never turn anyone against you and I never had. You are the one lying. I loved you, but now I see it' not enough. So, yes, goodbye. I hope you live a nice life. Am I an insencitive jerk? I apologise. There. BYE FOREVER<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Not to be rude or anything, but I do recall you telling people that you lied about your age a while back ago...maybe that was what she was refering to...I am sorry for interfereing...)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You sure do relate to her...*Gets suspicuois*<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I was just simply pointing out the fact that that was what she was refering to...nothing else...and plus, she was probably one of my first friends that I had here, too, so I give reasons why she may be angry with you...or whatever...I guess... <br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I see. I do not understand how I turned everybody against her though. I don't remember posting anything that said &quot;BE MEAN TO HER&quot; or anything like that. I sure as Hell don't remember saying mean things about her behind her back. I don't know what in the Hell she is talking about when she said that.<br>
<br>
Very interesting...She can be a bit confusing and odd occasionally...I usually don't agree with anything she says nor understand her...all I know is that she can be nice when she wants to...Wait...that had absolutley nothing to do with what I was talking about. Screw it...Now if you will excuse me, I must stop interfereing with you peoples' problems and go do something else...
