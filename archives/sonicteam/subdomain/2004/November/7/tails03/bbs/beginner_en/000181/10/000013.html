 the bartender started to charge money. I saw a poster on the east wall that asked for a mercenary, and that a reward will be given. I found out that an &quot;S&quot; with lines through it means green paper. I took the job and completed it flawlessly. I got $100 for that job. I stuck to that routine until today. I go to the same bar everyday, hoping to find the answers to my existence. I know it might not be the best idea but maybe I'll learn something on one of my mercenary jobs. I have to become acquainted with this city enviroment as well. My destiny I am unclear of. I must find the answer!<br>
After one of my mercenary jobs, I became weak and stumbled into the city, looking for a medic of some sort. I thought to myself, if people saw me and saw what I was like, think of what they'd do! I could end up in a laboratory again! So I hid in the alleys, hoping the pain would blow over. I felt as if my head would split. I fell asleep and woke up in a bed. I looked at myself in a mirror as a different person. I was a human. I went back into my room and saw a Calumon. I remember. Calumon and I were one to create the Demi-Human Cyanalu. What happened to bring me to the one planet where? I must have been first fused there. The world returned to normal for me until school hit. I entered class knowing few of my classmates. I felt weird. The information from the lessons from the past couple of weeks were blurry to me. Maybe fusion depletes a part of my unecessary memory. I didn't care, as long I had my Digimon and my girlfriend. Thank god I remembered my girlfriend's name or she'd probably dump me, my best friend's name and some others. But I had to re-learn the others. It felt embarrassing but at the same time, cool. I had a second chance to redeem myself and keep out all the other embarrassing experiences with those people. And Cal's memory is as bleak as mine, which might or might not be good. I watched the school news, only remembring one person, who I thought of as a rival. With what I went through, that's a miracle. I went into class with a blank mind. I remembered who I sat next to, Abby and Julie. I sat down and looked at Mrs. Catania, my social studies teacher, blankly, wide-eyed and scared that I'd be called on for a question. &quot;Hey, Ryan!&quot; said the perky Mrs. Catania, &quot;Where ya been these two weeks?&quot; I held back my gasp at the statement. &quot;I was gone for two weeks?&quot; I responded. &quot;Yeah...&quot; said Mrs. Catania, becoming suspicious. &quot;Oh yeah! I was on a much needed vacation!&quot; I said, nervously. &quot;Well, I believe that's the longest alotted amount of time to take off for a vacation. Besides, don'tcha know that we miss you?&quot; she responded. &quot;I won't miss anymore days, Mrs. Catania.&quot; I sat down afterwards for class. Luckily, all that class, we took notes, and just a tiny bit of questions, like 2 or 3. I instantly became happy because of not being embarrassed, but not for long. I had science next and Mr. Balest asks a lot of questions. I gulped and walked in the room. I vaguely remembered where I sat. Lauren, the person I sat next to, helped me out, but she didn't get suspcious of my loss of memory. Mr. Balest had little cards shuffled with numbers on them and whenever he asks a question, he picks the top one off and calls on the person with that designated number, according to his class list. I almost got called on, the numbers adjacent to mine had to answer, but then again I didn't know what number I was. I got through the class, without having to answer any questions, not listening because I knew Cal and I would fuse again soon so why bother trying to learn any more!?<br>

Abilities:<br>
With his long ears, reaching to his knees, he can twirl in the air and create a mini tornado or, while spinning, slam into an enemy. If, in the air, he can cross his arms over his chest and then reach as far apart as possible and have an area be showered down by a group of small diamonds. With his weapons, the Sun and the Moon, other than normal combat, he can overlap one another and create a burst of elemental energy (Solar and Lunar Eclipse, meaning Fire or Ice energ <br>
