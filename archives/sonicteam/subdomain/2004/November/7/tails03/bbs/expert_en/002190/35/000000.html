We had been following the migrating dragons for some time now. The sun was setting. The black dragon, who was obviously the leader, stopped walking. The green dragon spoke. &quot;Kerchak,&quot; He said. &quot;There is a more protected spot further down the-&quot; the black dragon interupted him. &quot;We'll rest here for the night. Go ahead, Zimbarii.&quot; The green dragon grunted, then roared loudly. The other dragons all started finding spots to sleep, literally climbing over each other in order to find the best spots.<br>
<br>
The elderly dull green dragon said to the old dull blue one, &quot;Oh, Aniyu, I wish we were at the pastures now. All this pushing and shoving about, just for a place to sleep.&quot; The blue one replied, &quot;Kaya, you've got big feet, just give 'em a kick!&quot; A small dragon tried to climb over the blue one. She kicked it off. &quot;Hi there!&quot; shouted Atri when she was next to the blue dragon. The blue dragon jumped up in suprise. &quot;Oh, sorry about that.&quot; Said Dante. &quot;She gets a little excited sometimes.&quot; &quot;I understand.&quot; Said the blue dragon. She held out her hand. &quot;Name's Aniyu. This,&quot; She pointed to the dull green dragon. &quot;Is Kaya.&quot; We looked up at Kaya. She was very tall and had a very long neck! Kaya looked down at us. &quot;Hello there. Who are you?&quot; &quot;I'm Danteno.&quot; Said Dante, flying up to see Kaya. &quot;But you can call me Dante.&quot; &quot;I'm Doragonu.&quot; Said Gonu, also flying up to see Kaya. &quot;But everyone calls me Gonu.&quot; &quot;I be Atriiyu!&quot; Said Atri, zooming around in cilcles. &quot;But everyone calling me Atri!&quot; &quot;And I'm Zephyr.&quot; I said. &quot;Zephyr Windstorm.&quot; A small bright green dragon walked up to me, smiling, but he didn't say anything. &quot;Well I'll be.&quot; Said Aniyu. &quot;Ren doesn't normally warm up to strangers so fast.&quot; By now, the sun had almost completely disapeared behind the mountains. &quot;Well, tme for bed.&quot; Said Kaya, curling up to sleep. We all did the same.<br>
