&gt; Claws the Wolverine: part one<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; A long time ago, back when many castles were still young, a wolverine was born in a poor, cruel family.  His parents were always fighting.  Even though he only lived there for three years, this seemed to make him think that fighting was the anser to everything.  Then, one day, disaster struck.  The world entered the dark ages.  The wolverine's parents couldn't care for him anymore.  So, they abandond him.  That night was probably the worst night of his life.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; the next morning:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; A wizard was walking through town.  He needed an asistant.  When the wizard saw the wolverine, he took him home and made him his asistant.  He named the wolverine Claws.  Claws lived with the wizard for many years, and always hated him.  This wizard was, in fact, Dr. Eggman's ancestor.  The wizard even looked like him!  One day, on his 15th birthday, Claws was working harder than ever.  But not because he wanted to.  That wizard became very lazy ever since Claws was old enough to do things for him.  It was always &quot;Claws, get me this!&quot; or &quot;Claws have you gotten that ingredient yet?&quot;.  Worst of all, he even made Claws make magic for him.  Then one day, Claws mixed a little of this with a dash of that and a handfull of these and just a little pinch of those, and he had made a potion like no other.  &quot;Yes!  It worked!  My time travel potion is complete!&quot; Cried the wizard....<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; to be continued...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (this is the same wolverine that appeared in my other story)<br>
