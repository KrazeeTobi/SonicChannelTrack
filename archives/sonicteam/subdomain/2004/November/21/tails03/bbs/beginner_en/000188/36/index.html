Claws the Wolverine: part 4<br>
<br>
Claws told Sonic about himself, but Sonic didn't believe him.  Claws got angry.  He wanted to jump up and rip that pesky blue hedgehog to shreds.  He tried to do just that, but he couldn't.  (remember, he was in the hospital)  So, Claws waited.  He waited, and waited, and waited.  After a few weeks, he was able to get up.  He was about to rip Sonic in half, when suddenly, there was a crashing sound.  I think we know who was stomping through town.  That's right.  Dr.Eggman!  He was driving his robot through town. (I don't know why, it's just part of the story!)  Claws saw Eggman and regognized him right away.  Or at least, he THOUGHT he did. (remember when I said the wizard looked like Eggman?) Claws broke through the glass window, and jumped out.  Claws knew that Eggman wanted to destroy Sonic.  He didn't know HOW he knew it, but he knew it.  Claws ran over to Sonic and punched him as hard as he could.  POW!  &quot;Take that!&quot; He shouted.  Eggman was suprised.  &quot;What is that crazy wolverine doing?!?!&quot; He thought.  &quot;Well, I might as well take advantage of it.&quot; He shot a laser at Sonic.  Sonic was shocked.  &quot;What's going on?!?&quot; He thought.  Everything faded to black. (insert suspensful music here)<br>
