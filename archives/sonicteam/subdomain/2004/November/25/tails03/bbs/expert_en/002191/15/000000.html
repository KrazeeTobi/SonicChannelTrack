Kerchak, Zimbarii, and Vixanie stopped walking.  Kerchak whispered to Zimbarii.  &quot;Zimbarii, there are a lot of first timers here.  Make sure they understand.&quot;  Zimbarii nodded, ten said, for everyone to hear, &quot;If this is your first crossing, listen up!  There is no water until we get to the other side of that hill.&quot; He pointed a to a large hill, many miles from us.  &quot;And you'd better keep up, because if a predator catches you, you're on your own.  Move out!&quot; We all started walking again.  &quot;Oh...&quot; Said Dante.  &quot;It looks like a very long walk.&quot; &quot;Hot too!&quot; Said Atri.  &quot;If Dante, Gonu, Zephyr, aniyu and Kaya smell something burning, it might be Atri!&quot;<br>
<br>
a few days later...<br>
<br>
We were much closer to the hill.  Kerchak and Zimbarii started roaring happily, and advanced toward the hill.  &quot;The lake!&quot; Cried Aniyu happily.  &quot;We made it?&quot; I asked.  &quot;It's just over that hill!&quot; Replied Aniyu.  &quot;Thank goodness.&quot; Said Kaya.  Since Dante, Gonu, Atri and I were faster, we went over the hill first.  But instead of a lake, we saw a dried-up wasteland.  There were some dragon bones in there.  Kaya walked over the hill too.  &quot;Wh-Where's the lake?&quot; she asked.  Aniyu walked over the hill, and also saw the wasteland.  &quot;B-But...&quot; She stammered.  &quot;But we always had water before...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kerchak looked at the dried up lake, then turned and said, &quot;The pastures are only a few days away.  Keep moving!&quot;  Vixanie ran after him and said, &quot;But Kerchak!  We've never gone this far without water!  If we keep going like this we'll lose half the herd!&quot; Kerchak turned and said, &quot;Then we save the half that deserves to live.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aniyu hadn't moved a bit.  She was still sitting in the middle of the dried lake.  &quot;We always had water...&quot; she whimpered.  &quot;We always had water here before... We always had water here, always... And now, there isn't even mud...&quot;  Kaya walked over to Aniyu, her large feet crushing the hard ground.  &quot;There is no water here, Aniyu.&quot;  I had ran over next to Aniyu, when I ntoiced how Kaya's foot was crushing the dry ground.  &quot;Kaya!&quot; I said.  &quot;Don't move!&quot;  &quot;What is it?&quot; Asked Kaya.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot;  &quot;Guys!&quot; I shouted.  &quot;Dante, Gonu, Atri!  Come over here!&quot; They all came flying over.  &quot;Guys. listen.&quot; I could hear something gurgling under the ground.  &quot;I hear it!&quot; Said Dante.  &quot;So do I!&quot; Said Gonu.  &quot;Atri hears too!&quot;  &quot;Lift your foot, Kaya!&quot; I said.  Kaya did so.  We all started digging in the ground, which was very soft and moist.  &quot;Now press down.&quot; I said.  As soon as Kaya pressed her foot into the ground, water appeared!  We all roared loudly.  &quot;Water!  Over here!&quot; I shouted.<br>
<br>
We all took long drinks, until Kerchak showed up.  He pushed us all away and took the water hole for himself.  We decided to stay a while, and get a few drinks.<br>
