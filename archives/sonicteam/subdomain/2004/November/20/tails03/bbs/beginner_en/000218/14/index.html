&gt; He remembered when he was tiny, just a baby, his mother hissing and snarling at the giant hand that would come into the tank to grab mice. He had felt so protected! He knew now that his mom never stood a chance against the dreaded hand, but the fact that she put her life on the line for her children so quickly, without thought of her own doom, had taught at least one of her little sons courage. So, hissing and hopping, he came at the human. Let the other mice see it, and stay, he prayed. He was sure he would be squashed for this. His heart raced. He had to make a good show of it.  <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; He rattled his tail, and chirped loudly. He dodged quickly back and forth. He jumped high and showed the human his teeth. The other mice stopped and gaped. Mike appeared out of nowhere with several other mice just in time to see the futile display. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Amazingly, the human just laughed! He cocked his head to one side and raised his thick eyebrows. &quot;What a strange mouse you are,&quot; he said. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The Mouse Knight stopped and stared, his eyes full of surprise. No squish? <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mike moved without hesitation where all the others were frozen with fear and disbelief. He ran out, and as quick as he could, tried to grab Mouseknight from harm. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; And, almost as quick, the human yelled, &quot;Look out, mouse!&quot; and moved to swat Mike away with his gigantic open hand. But Mike had been around the block more than twice, and was in his prime. He dodged the hand easily, big slow thing, and thought about biting it for good measure, but decided against it. If the man had hurt his little friend though, Mike would have taken at least the ounce of mouse out of the human's hide. Mike clamped his jaws around the little mouse's neck scruff and made off with him. The human gave chase for a few feet, but couldn't fit into the bush. The other mice all ran after Mike as fast as they could. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; After a minute they were under a building. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;Attacking humans now, mister mouse?&quot; Mike asked incredulously. &quot;Are you completely nuts?&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;The others had to get away,&quot; Mouseknight said. &quot;You shouldn't have grabbed me - he wasn't going to hurt me.&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;How could you know?&quot; Mike stared. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mouseknight began back toward the sidewalk. &quot;I just know, Mike. He had his chance.&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;Yeah, and he took it with me!&quot; Mike exclaimed. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;That swat was so slow,&quot; the mouse replied. &quot;If he'd been trying to hurt you, you'd be hurt. He was not a fat, slow human.&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The sidewalk was empty. The little mouse sighed and turned around. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mike just eyed his friend. &quot;You don't think he was a human who actually liked mice, do you?&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;Maybe not that one, but they have to exist, Mike. They do.&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mike gave him a look that said, you're dreaming but I love you anyway. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They returned to the group, which sat huddled in their hidey-hole. No one knew what to say. But Mike went to some of the new mice and said, &quot;See?&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They eyed Mouseknight. &quot;Yes, you may all come,&quot; said one of them, a big brawny brown one, and led the way out of the hole. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; All the way down the gutter they continued to eye the Mouseknight. He looked around. They were all eyeing him. He snaffed and looked over at Mike. At least Mike was nonchalant, as always. He heard whispers of &quot;Stood up to a human twice&quot; and &quot;Not a normal mouse...&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &quot;Hey.&quot; He stopped, and turned on the mice. They all backed up into each other and showed signs of submission, though most of them were twice his size. Their eyes got real big. &quot;I'm just a mouse,&quot; he said. &quot;Just like you. We're all just mice, and we all suffer the same, hurt the same, and feel the same. Any of you could have done what I did. Maybe it's time we stopped thinking that we are just mice and started thinking that being a mouse is a great thing to be. This just helpless mice thing is getting on my mouse nerves. So what about that!&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They remained motionless for a few seconds (long time for a mouse to stay still, much less 20 mice) and then they broke into cheers, squeaks of joy, and little hops of pleasure. They picked up their hero mouse and carried him the rest of the way, led by the street mice, who were cheering also. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mouseknight looked down at Mike. &quot;Get me down!&quot; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Mike just laughed.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; to be continued.<br>
