We found ourselves walking in the desert. We were too egsausted to fly, so we just walked. Suddenly, I saw something small run by. &quot;Hey!&quot; I said. &quot;Did you see that?&quot; &quot;I did!&quot; Said Gonu. &quot;Atri saw it too!&quot; Said Atri. &quot;Where did it go?&quot; Asked Gonu. &quot;I dunno.&quot; I replied. &quot;Let's go see.&quot; I started walking after it. &quot;Leave it alone!&quot; Said Dante. &quot;it's.. It's scaring Atri.&quot; &quot;No it's not.&quot; Said Atri, giggling a bit. &quot;Everyone just be quiet.&quot; I said. &quot;You'll scare it.&quot;<br>
<br>
We walked after it, looking around to see where it went. Suddenly, we saw it, standing out in the open. It ran behind a rock before we got a good look at it, but I could see that it was a very small dragon, and it seemed to have large claws. Then, it came outfrom behind the rock, and there was another one with it! It was a small, reddish brown dragon, with no wings. but it had large claws on its hands and feet and seemed to have very muscular legs.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, from behind another rock, two more popped out! Then two more came out from behind another rock! They surrounded us, and we were frightened, but we were too tired to fly. So instead, we ran. The small dragons chased after us.<br>
<br>
We ran for a very long time, the small dragons still following us. suddenly, a cloud of dust appeared in front of us. The dragons weren't following us anymore. &quot;Guys, they stopped!&quot; I shouted. Suddenly, a large black dragon knocked me, Dante, Gonu and Atri down. &quot;Stay out of my way!&quot; He shouted, then walked past us. A large green dragon was walking with him. &quot;You heard Kerchak!&quot; He shouted. &quot;Move it!&quot; Many dragons of all different colors followed them. They were what was causing the dust cloud!<br>
<br>
Finally, they seemed to all have passed. but then, two old dragons and one very young slowly lumbered past. &quot;Walking backwards, huh?&quot; Asked the blue one, who was a very dull blue. &quot;Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster.&quot; Then she turned and shouted to the young one, a small bright red dragon, &quot;Keep those little legs moving, Ren, or you'll get left behind!&quot; The dark red dragons were following. We decided to try to blend in with the crowd, so they wouldn't try to get us.<br>
