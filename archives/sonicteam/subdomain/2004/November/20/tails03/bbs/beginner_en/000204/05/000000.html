The Chronicles of Snowfrost and Dark: part two<br>
<br>
I ran home and told my mother what had happened. &quot;Your soul sister has been unleashed. She is a dark sister. That means her name is Dark Snowfrost.&quot; Said my mother. &quot;How do you know that?&quot; I asked. &quot;A soul sister is always either good or evil. They becone your evil side or your good side. By the way you described your soul sister, she is definatly evil. If she was good her name would be Good Snowfrost. But she is instead evil.&quot; &quot;I see...&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
I was frightened of Dark Snowfrost. I knew that she could appear at any moment. I decided to go for a walk.<br>
<br>
On my walk, I saw what looked like a tiny dragon. He was reddish-brown and was about a foot or so long. Since I'm about 20 feet long, this is quite small. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; he asked me. &quot;I don't know.&quot; I said. &quot;I'm just taking a walk.&quot; &quot;I think you must go somewhere. Follow me!&quot; he said. Then, he ran off. For such a little dragon, he sure was fast! I ran after him.<br>
<br>
Soon, I came to a large lake. &quot;Look in the water,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;and tell me what you see.&quot; I looked into the water. There, looking back at me, was my reflection, just like every other time I looked in the water. &quot;I see my reflection.&quot; I said. &quot;Look harder.&quot; said the dragon. I did, and this time I saw my soul sister. The red fur down her back was waving in the wind. Her bright green eyes seemed to glow as she stared at me with a wicked smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.... Darkness.&quot; &quot;Exactly!&quot; said the little dragon. &quot;That is what has been inside of you all your life! You need to release it! I can help you...&quot;<br>
