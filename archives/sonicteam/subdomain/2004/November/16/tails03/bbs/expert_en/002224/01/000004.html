&gt; The reason for the topic title is that there's already a Japanese topic addressing a similar matter.  Look on page 67 of their board for a message with the text &quot;Part 3&quot; in it, and their times are in the three posts below that.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; While you're here, I should send out an invitation: If you want to compete outside of the confines of Sonic Team's board, sign up at http://sonic.parashift.org.  The Advance and Adventure series are all covered, and there's talk of adding the &quot;Oldskool&quot; games (1994 and before) to the tracking list.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Anyway, there are only two rules concerning what you CAN'T do to get record times here.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. If you pause the game and select the Restart option during a run in which your mission objective has been complete (i.e. you've tagged the Goal Ring, 100th Ring, Lost Chao, third Emerald, or third Key, as appropriate), any times achieved from that run or the next one are VOID.<br>
&gt; Rationale: In 100-ring missions, there's a one-frame (0.01666 second) timespan after you get ring #100 before the level ends. If you can pause the game in that frame, you can select Restart and the level will immediately be completed as you start. Because the timer is still counting up, your time from this trick will be 8.25 seconds. If it's allowed, then every Mission 2 time (except one) will have an easy record of 0:08, and one-fourth of our time competition is immediately lost. The rule as phrased bans not only this, but (if and when they're ever discovered) analogous practices on missions 1, 3, and 5. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. The acquisition of two or more Speed Shoes in a timespan of 14 or fewer seconds shall be known as Doublespeed Duration. Use of this procedure multiple times in a single session will cause any times attained in that session to be VOID. <br>
&gt; Rationale: At its root, Doublespeed Duration (also called DD) is just another nifty little timesaving trick: it saves about 1-5 seconds depending on the level, and it doesn't eliminate the factor of knowing how to complete the level. However, after multiple uses, you're effectively going everywhere with the effects of 5 or more Super Shoes simultaneously. This can cause ridiculously low times, to the point that anyone who doesn't know and use DD is effectively shut out of that level--and given the sheer number of levels (over 40) on which the technique can be used, allowing unrestricted usage would do nothing but deter &quot;outsider&quot; players from joining, and work towards permanently sealing off the Elite from the rest of the community. This is not our aim, so the verdict is: You can use DD once at a time for a small bonus if you know how, but any more than that is treated as &quot;abusive&quot;.<br>
