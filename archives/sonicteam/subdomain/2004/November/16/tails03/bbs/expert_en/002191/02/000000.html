It was morning now. I slowly opened my eyes, and saw that only Dante, Gonu, Atri, Aniyu, and Kaya were awake. Dante was talking with Aniyu. &quot;I heard you say something about a pasture?&quot; He said. &quot;It is the most beautiful place there is, Dante.&quot; Replied Aniyu. &quot;It's actually more of a valley, but there's so much green there that we call it a pasture. But the hard job now is just getting there.&quot; &quot;And,&quot; Said Kaya. &quot;We're being driven unmercifally.&quot; &quot;By who?&quot; Asked Gonu. &quot;Kerchak,&quot; Replied Aniyu. &quot;The herd's head honcho.&quot; &quot;We can hardly keep up.&quot; Whimpered Kaya. &quot;For an older dragon like myself, well, it's just indecent.&quot; &quot;Well, tell him.&quot; Said Dante. &quot;What's the worst he can do?&quot;<br>
<br>
No sooner had he said it, three dragons pushed passed us. I had to get up to avoid being stepped on. The dragons were the black one we had seen before, the green one that was always walking with him, and a dark pink one that we had never seen before. &quot;Hey!&quot; Said Gonu as they pushed pass. &quot;What's their problem?!&quot; &quot;That's him.&quot; Said Kaya. &quot;Kerchak.&quot; &quot;Excuse me, Kerchak!&quot; Said Dante, running up to Kerchak. &quot;Got a second?&quot; Kerchak and the green dragon whirled around. &quot;Get lost, kid.&quot; said the green one. &quot;Relax, Zimbarii.&quot; Said Kerchak. &quot;Who are you?&quot; He asked Gonu. &quot;Doragonu, but I prefer to be called Gonu.&quot; Replied Doragonu. &quot;I was back here, talking to these guys.&quot; He pointed to Aniyu and Kaya. &quot;They're having a bit of trouble keeping up. so maybe you could slow it down a bit?&quot; Kerchak laughed a bit. &quot;Let the weak set the pace? Now there's an idea. Better let me do the thinking from now on, Gonu.&quot; He turned and walked away, Zimbarii and the dark pink dragon following him. The pink one turned around and said, &quot;Don't worry. That's how my brother treats newcomers... No matter how charming they are.&quot; Then she turned and followed Kerchak and Zimbarii.<br>
<br>
Atriiyu walked up to Gonu. &quot;Gonu sure knows how to catch a girl's eye!&quot; She laughed. &quot;I wouldn't be catching NOBODY's eye if I were you.&quot; Said Aniyu. &quot;Especially not Vixanie's. You just keep your head down and mind what Kerchak tells you.&quot; &quot;Since when do we take orders from him?!&quot; Cried Dante. &quot;I could hold that jerk's brain in the palm of my hand!&quot; &quot;No, Dante, she's right.&quot; I said, noticing the small dull red dragons following us. &quot;Better to keep our heads down with this bunch then get them bitten off by... those things.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; Said Kaya. &quot;Just consider yourselves lucky that's ALL that's following us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, two giant dark purple dragons with sharp teeth caught the scent of the herd. they saw our footprints, and began tracking us down.<br>
