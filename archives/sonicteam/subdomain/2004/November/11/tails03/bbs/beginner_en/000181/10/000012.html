Story:<br>
From what I know, I was an experiment on another planet. My memory is blurry. I remember seeing sparks and flashy lights. It felt like an interrogation. &quot;Finished!&quot; I heard one of the scientists say and he smirked in my face. I heard a female scientist address him as &quot;Dr. Osto&quot;. I felt a surge of power and I immediately was petrified. I couldn't move. I looked to the right of me and saw some kind of paper with the heading, &quot;The 'H' Project&quot;. My eyes widened at what this could mean. I wasn't real? I don't exist? Who am I? What am I? I look over my past memories for clues. During the night, they had locked me in a photonic cage, at least that's what a tag read. I don't know much human language. I thought or dreamed I moved my hands in a certain fashion and I bent the bars! I opened my eyes and was amazed at what I did. What I imagined, came to life. My long ears helped guide me through the lab without making a sound. It was as if I had supernatural powers. I darted through the sky and away from the lab. I didn't know anything other than when I was on that platform in the lab. Those scoundrels had kept me there like an animal! The scientists were of different species. Foxes, lions, etc., not the common house pet but they stood upright unusually and they wore glasses. Anyway, what to do now was unclear. Whether to hide out on this unknown planet, fight against the scientists, releasing all the subjects, find out more about that test facility and Dr. Osto or to search for a way to get off this planet!? I lived off the planet's resources, living in caves, eating strange fruits that I saw a giant ape, at least that's what it seemed to be, eat and it cooked it by shooting fire out of its mouth, killing native beasts for meat to eat with a pair of dagger-like weapons I like to call &quot;The Sun and the Moon&quot;. Then I stumbled upon a shuttle that was going to be launched to return to Earth. I believe I saw a banner with &quot;Pioneer 1&quot; on it. Apparently, they must not have liked the planet. I became a stowaway on the ship and rode it to Earth and disembarked. I felt as if I was home, but I didn't remember an Earth feeling. I darted around in the sky above a forest and then I saw a clearing. I landed in the clearing. A hidden cavern was to the left of me while a pile of fruit was right in front of me. It was tropical paradise compared to what was on the other planet. I feel lighter here, though. It feels odd. I soon heard a rumble, it sounded like thunder. I looked around frantically for the source. I then saw a black figure in the trees. I ran into the cave, fearing for my safety. The black figure was a strange shape and I couldn't put my finger on what it might be. Anyway, I saw yellow eyes looking at me so I didn't look. The figure took the fruit elsewhere. I wandered out of the cave, hungry and depressed. I heard city-like noises a couple miles away (my ears help that out alot.). I traveled towards those noises. The city was strange. Strange metal things with wheels (cars) were moving fast, near me, who knows what they were. I knew nothing about this world. All I knew was fighting. I saw people hand green paper (money) over to other people. The people traded this money for items. I was confused. I think you get things by giving people green papers. I went into a bar and the man behind the counter became scared and offered me a drink. I drank this strangely-colored liquid and decided to drink more of it. Not too much, for  <br>
