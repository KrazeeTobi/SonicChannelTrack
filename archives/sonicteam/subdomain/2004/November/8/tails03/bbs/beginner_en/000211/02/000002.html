The next day, Velux, while working in the lab, received a call. Slamming his fist down on the data he had just collected, Velux walked over to answer the phone.<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; He said with a tone of arrogance in his voice.<br>
&quot;Sir! An intruder has entered the building! They're armed and have already killed all personnel on floors 1-3. They are making their way to---&quot;<br>
Velux stood there, horrified, tuning out the panicked rambling. Who would possibly be commiting such a crime against PERSON Inc.? Nearly everyone depended on PERSON Inc. to provide them with quality goods and such. Who would want to destroy the producer of the people? Who would do such a terror-inducing act?<br>
&quot;Kelthet...&quot; Velux mumbled.<br>
&quot;What, sir?&quot; asked the person on the other end of the line.<br>
&quot;Order an immediate evacuation of floors 7-60. Evacuate them to the rooftop. Request a few helicopters from the Snowflake Empire to aid in our escape. Send all armed personnel to floor 5.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, and Vincent,&quot; said Velux, &quot;Stay alive out there, okay?&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you for your concern, sir&quot; replied Vincent, hanging up the phone.<br>
&quot;What in Kilroy's name is Kelthet doing here...&quot; Velux muttered to himself, &quot;Oh well. I've taken care of him before.&quot; Velux grabbed a hand pistol and made off for the fifth floor.<br>
<br>
The intercom came on, &quot;All personnel on floors 7-60. An evacuation to the rooftop has been ordered. Security personnel are to report to floor 5 to intercept and engage intruder. I repeat: All personnel on floors 7-60. An evacuation to the rooftop has been ordered. Security personnel are to report to floor 5 to intercept and engage intruder.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm,&quot; said the intruder, &quot;That ought to rid the building of useless bystanders. I suppose I'll have to deal with a bit of security, though. All this hassle just to speak with the CEO... tch tch... How unpleasant.&quot; He looked at his sword and smiled meekly.<br>
The intruder had made it to the staircase to the fifth floor. A couple of oblivious personnel were at the top waiting for him. They were a male and a female. Obviously, they had not heard the evacuation notice over the intercom and were just chatting away as though it were a normal day.<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, but you are you are in my way. Please move now.&quot; cooly said the intruder.<br>
&quot;Oh, and what of it, buddy? Do you expect me to move? Jeez... hey... Do you even work here?!&quot; replied the male<br>
&quot;Your rudeness is astonishing. Unfortunately, it is your downfall as well. How misfortunate for you and your friend here.&quot; As soon as the intruder had finished his rebuke, he horizontaly swept his sword at the two and they fell to the ground with a thud.<br>
The intruder ran down the hallway until he was in front of a legion of security personnel. The person closest to him looked at him in astonishment for the longest time, then he said, akwardly, &quot;You're not Kelthet...&quot;<br>
&quot;How observant. I wish to speak with you.&quot; replied the intruder.<br>
&quot;Couldn't you have just requested and appointment with my secretary? It would have saved the lives of my employees.&quot; said Velux, with a slight hint of rage.<br>
&quot;That would take time, and time is what I don't have.&quot; said the intruder, cooly and indifferent.<br>
Velux slowly started to turn red. He didn't like the fact that this man had just slaughtered a whole slew of his employees, just to get to him. He raised his pistol at the intruder and said, &quot;No. Time is not what you have, is it? Never again will you have to be bothered by time. Have fun in the morg.&quot; He shot the intruder near the heart.<br>
The intruder staggered a bit, then cool-headedly replied, &quot;You try my patience,&quot; before crashing to the ground in death. Velux ordered that all security personnel return to their patrols, then he looked at the freshly slain corpse in front of him.<br>
Just imagine his surprise when the corpse jumped to its feet and said, &quot;Now that was a bit cocky, wasn't it? You have much to learn about sociability. Anyway, I request your assistence.&quot;<br>
Velux was so horrified at what had just taken place that he agreed to help the man, only to ensure that he, himself, would be living in the next day or so.<br>
