sonic was make back in 1991 that is when the game sonic the H came out every sence then he has been very pouplar later the made sonic the H 2 which included tails a yung fox with two tails also when the game was made the took out two things asha &quot;sonic's borther&quot; and an extra level lader thay made a game caled sonic the H 3 which this was the first aperance of knoulcks. knoulcks was 15 at the time when he got tricked by dr.robotnick which they call him in japan dr.eggman that is why he is caled dr.eggman in the newer games after the game sonic the H 3 was made they made sonic and koulkls. and this game was able to cimbined with sonic the H 2 and 3 then they made sonic cd for computer this was one of the first games with sonic i am not sure if sonic cd came first or sonic game world for peco came first. lader afther that they made sonic pinball and sonic 3d bast after that they made sonic R and then sonic ad1 and in sonic ad1 they have a part were sonic looks like he did in sonic R. after sonic ad1 they made sonic ad2 this was the last game they made for saga. soon they sold out to nintedo that is when they made sonic ad2 battle and sonic advance and then the made sonic dx and then sonic advance 2 and then sonic heros and sonic battle and then sonic advance 3. that is all i know about sonic for now i will put more later.
