It truely breaks my heart to see what's happening. The BBS went down for a while(there's your answer by the way), ST or whoever is kind enough to fix it, and you fucking n00bs continue to spam the board up... Pathetic... The BBS was better off being destroyed, all(most of you guys that is) that you damn people do is spam and use this board as a chat room. I find it quite ironic that most of the idiots who spam here have their own message boards that they brag about and advertise so damn much too. How immature, these BBS boards are for sonic games only and when was it that I last saw a good post about a sonic game? Very long ago actually. Instead of spamming up a board designed for sonic fans, why don't you people go out and get a life? If being on the internet, ruining this board(and perhaps others you may have gone to) is your life, than you are so pathetic. In fact, it's so stupid, pathetic, and immature that I am leaving this BBS for good. It is nothing personal between any of the members, just the way that so many of them act. I may come back to help the sonic fans, but since there are so few of them with good questions, the chances are slim that you will see me here again. I bid you all farewell.<br>
