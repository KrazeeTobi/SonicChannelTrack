The beginning takes place long ago, back when there were other silver echidnas like myself.<br>
<br>
The Tale of the Shadowlight Blade<br>
<br>
Forged over 10,000 years ago, half made of pure good and half of pure evil, the Shadowlight Blade can only be wielded by someone directly in-between good and evil. It was made by the very first silver echidnas, who were outcasts because they were the only silver ones. Two male and two female, they all wanted to wield a weapon of ultimite power. Two wanted a blade able to do only good. Two wanted a blade of ultimite evil. Each pair had one male and one female.<br>
<br>
After much arguing, they reached a compromise. They made the Shadowlight Blade. But then they reached another problem. Who would wield it? After much more arguing, they figured out that none of them could wield it themselves, because they were all either too good or too evil. So the silver echidnas built a temple, which became sacred to them. The temple had only one chamber, in which there was one stone plaque, and the Shadowlight Blade had been embedded deep in the rock. Anyone who could get it out was the one worthy of wielding it.<br>
<br>
The silver echidnas parted ways. The good ones started a tribe to the east of the temple, and the evil ones started a tribe to the west. They each hoped that one of their decendants would be the one to remove the Blade from the plaque. But all the ones raised in the evil tribe were too evil. It was the other way around with the good tribe.<br>
<br>
But then my parents, a male from the good tribe and a female from the evil tribe, met. They had me, or course. When I was old enough, I went to the temple in search of the Shadowlight Blade. When I got there, I pulled the handle of the sword with all my might, and it came out!<br>
<br>
The two tribs became one, but then were destroyed. Out of the hundreds of silver echidnas that once lived, only I remain.<br>
<br>
The end. Were you expecting a happy ending?<br>
<br>
Tell me what you think of my story!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Tale of the Shadowlight Blade<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Forged over 10,000 years ago, half made of pure good and half of pure evil, the Shadowlight Blade can only be wielded by someone directly in-between good and evil. It was made by the very first silver echidnas, who were outcasts because they were the only silver ones. Two male and two female, they all wanted to wield a weapon of ultimite power. Two wanted a blade able to do only good. Two wanted a blade of ultimite evil. Each pair had one male and one female.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After much arguing, they reached a compromise. They made the Shadowlight Blade. But then they reached another problem. Who would wield it? After much more arguing, they figured out that none of them could wield it themselves, because they were all either too good or too evil. So the silver echidnas built a temple, which became sacred to them. The temple had only one chamber, in which there was one stone plaque, and the Shadowlight Blade had been embedded deep in the rock. Anyone who could get it out was the one worthy of wielding it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silver echidnas parted ways. The good ones started a tribe to the east of the temple, and the evil ones started a tribe to the west. They each hoped that one of their decendants would be the one to remove the Blade from the plaque. But all the ones raised in the evil tribe were too evil. It was the other way around with the good tribe.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then my parents, a male from the good tribe and a female from the evil tribe, met. They had me, or course. When I was old enough, I went to the temple in search of the Shadowlight Blade. When I got there, I pulled the handle of the sword with all my might, and it came out!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two tribs became one, but then were destroyed. Out of the hundreds of silver echidnas that once lived, only I remain.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The end. Were you expecting a happy ending?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tell me what you think of my story!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The beginning takes place long ago, back when there were other silver echidnas like myself.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Tale of the Shadowlight Blade<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Forged over 10,000 years ago, half made of pure good and half of pure evil, the Shadowlight Blade can only be wielded by someone directly in-between good and evil. It was made by the very first silver echidnas, who were outcasts because they were the only silver ones. Two male and two female, they all wanted to wield a weapon of ultimite power. Two wanted a blade able to do only good. Two wanted a blade of ultimite evil. Each pair had one male and one female.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After much arguing, they reached a compromise. They made the Shadowlight Blade. But then they reached another problem. Who would wield it? After much more arguing, they figured out that none of them could wield it themselves, because they were all either too good or too evil. So the silver echidnas built a temple, which became sacred to them. The temple had only one chamber, in which there was one stone plaque, and the Shadowlight Blade had been embedded deep in the rock. Anyone who could get it out was the one worthy of wielding it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The silver echidnas parted ways. The good ones started a tribe to the east of the temple, and the evil ones started a tribe to the west. They each hoped that one of their decendants would be the one to remove the Blade from the plaque. But all the ones raised in the evil tribe were too evil. It was the other way around with the good tribe.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But then my parents, a male from the good tribe and a female from the evil tribe, met. They had me, or course. When I was old enough, I went to the temple in search of the Shadowlight Blade. When I got there, I pulled the handle of the sword with all my might, and it came out!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two tribs became one, but then were destroyed. Out of the hundreds of silver echidnas that once lived, only I remain.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The end. Were you expecting a happy ending?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tell me what you think of my story!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>

Sorry.  That's part of the curse.  You will live forever, but never be able to move from that spot.  Many things will attack you, and you will be in immense pain, but you will never die.  That is the true horror of this curse.

&gt; The beginning takes place long ago, back when there were other silver echidnas like myself.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The Tale of the Shadowlight Blade<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Forged over 10,000 years ago, half made of pure good and half of pure evil, the Shadowlight Blade can only be wielded by someone directly in-between good and evil. It was made by the very first silver echidnas, who were outcasts because they were the only silver ones. Two male and two female, they all wanted to wield a weapon of ultimite power. Two wanted a blade able to do only good. Two wanted a blade of ultimite evil. Each pair had one male and one female.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; After much arguing, they reached a compromise. They made the Shadowlight Blade. But then they reached another problem. Who would wield it? After much more arguing, they figured out that none of them could wield it themselves, because they were all either too good or too evil. So the silver echidnas built a temple, which became sacred to them. The temple had only one chamber, in which there was one stone plaque, and the Shadowlight Blade had been embedded deep in the rock. Anyone who could get it out was the one worthy of wielding it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The silver echidnas parted ways. The good ones started a tribe to the east of the temple, and the evil ones started a tribe to the west. They each hoped that one of their decendants would be the one to remove the Blade from the plaque. But all the ones raised in the evil tribe were too evil. It was the other way around with the good tribe.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But then my parents, a male from the good tribe and a female from the evil tribe, met. They had me, or course. When I was old enough, I went to the temple in search of the Shadowlight Blade. When I got there, I pulled the handle of the sword with all my might, and it came out!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The two tribs became one, but then were destroyed. Out of the hundreds of silver echidnas that once lived, only I remain.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The end. Were you expecting a happy ending?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Tell me what you think of my story!<br>
<br>
&gt;It sucks.<br>

&gt; &gt; The beginning takes place long ago, back when there were other silver echidnas like myself.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The Tale of the Shadowlight Blade<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Forged over 10,000 years ago, half made of pure good and half of pure evil, the Shadowlight Blade can only be wielded by someone directly in-between good and evil. It was made by the very first silver echidnas, who were outcasts because they were the only silver ones. Two male and two female, they all wanted to wield a weapon of ultimite power. Two wanted a blade able to do only good. Two wanted a blade of ultimite evil. Each pair had one male and one female.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; After much arguing, they reached a compromise. They made the Shadowlight Blade. But then they reached another problem. Who would wield it? After much more arguing, they figured out that none of them could wield it themselves, because they were all either too good or too evil. So the silver echidnas built a temple, which became sacred to them. The temple had only one chamber, in which there was one stone plaque, and the Shadowlight Blade had been embedded deep in the rock. Anyone who could get it out was the one worthy of wielding it.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The silver echidnas parted ways. The good ones started a tribe to the east of the temple, and the evil ones started a tribe to the west. They each hoped that one of their decendants would be the one to remove the Blade from the plaque. But all the ones raised in the evil tribe were too evil. It was the other way around with the good tribe.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; But then my parents, a male from the good tribe and a female from the evil tribe, met. They had me, or course. When I was old enough, I went to the temple in search of the Shadowlight Blade. When I got there, I pulled the handle of the sword with all my might, and it came out!<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The two tribs became one, but then were destroyed. Out of the hundreds of silver echidnas that once lived, only I remain.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The end. Were you expecting a happy ending?<br>
