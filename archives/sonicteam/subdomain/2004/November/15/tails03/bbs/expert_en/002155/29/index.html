One quiet evening Jewel the Chao was getting ready for her date with the cutest, kewlest chao in the garden. She is a NiGHTS chao (neutral flying) and Flash (her date) was a Dark Power type chao. They were going to go to the chao stadium and watch the chao races, then follow that up with a little picnic with chao fruit (skill for Jewel and Dark for Flash) in the chao garden in the moonlight (...dont ask about the moonlight...in the chao garden) ....she was really newvous.....what if she did something rude..or she spilled something on herself? Since this was her 1st date she wanted to make a good impression so she went to the Black Market and bought Flash a brand new Ski Mask for when he is in karate matches. She was so excited. She was suppose to meet him in the chao garden....<br>
<br>
....a couple of hours later............she walked into the portal for the chao garden to see that the only chao that was there was Flash....so they were off to the stadium.....<br>

As they entered the extremley large stadium they saw two path ways and a sign that said <br>
&quot;Chao Races - Right&quot;<br>
&quot;Chao Karate - Left&quot;<br>
so they went right. As they entered they saw the 8 chao that were going to race. They went down and sat on the bleachers. Then an announcer came on the mic and said &quot;Welcome to the chao races! Tonight the racers are going to have to go through a track of very hard things. They have to use their skills in swimming, running, flying, and power.....now please wait and the races will be beginning shortly....&quot; Then about one minute later the announcer came on and said &quot;Now....let the races BEGIN!&quot; And then there was a gunshot and the chao were off.....<br>
<br>
10 minutes after watching......&quot;And the winner is.......KALAKARI!&quot; Then the audience clapped as he was about to recieve the trophy and the race was over....so Flash and Jewel set off back to the chao garden.
