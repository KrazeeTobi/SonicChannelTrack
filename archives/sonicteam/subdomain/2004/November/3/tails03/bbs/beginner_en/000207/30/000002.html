&gt; (Don't read this story unless you know about Neopets!)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hello.  I am Xaudiur, the gelupe.  What's a gelupe, you might ask?  It's a cross between a lupe and a gelert.  Gelupes look mostly like gelerts, except that they have fluffy, lupe like tails.  Anyway, here's my story!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I was born in a faraway city, I can't remember where. I know it was not a world in Neopia now. I had three other siblings born at the same time as me. Two were Luperts. That's what you call a gelupe that looks more lupe than gelert.  Luperts look mostly like lupes, only with gelert like tails.  The other was a gelupe, like me. He was male, and one lupert was female. We had to live away from humans.. *growl* such as yourself, because they were dangerous. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; One day, my parents went to hunt for food. They told us to stay in our house. We lived in an old alley. Nobody dared to go there because my parents would guard me and my siblings so fiercely. Suddenly, they saw a very large alley wocky. It looked very good to eat. My parents rushed over to attack it. We heard my father yelp, and my mother shriek. We didn't dare to look at the battle. When the fighting sounds died down, we looked out at the alley. There was blood everywhere, the wocky had left, and we saw something so horrible that it made all of us scream. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; There, lying on the ground, was a lupe and a gelert. We rushed over to them. Mother was breathing very heavily, and looked ready to die, but she managed to get up. Father was not so lucky. He was dead. We all cried. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It was winter now. Food was getting harder to find. One night it was so cold that we could hardly sleep. On cold nights, Father used to keep us warm with his fluffy tail. But Mother was a gelert, so she had no fluffy tail. She wrapped her thin tail around us. It didn't keep us very warm. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; When I woke up, I was the only one awake. I shook my brothers and sister. They wouldn't wake up. I did the same with mother. She wouldn't wake up either. I jumped up and down. Nothing. I screamed. Still nothing. I was alone. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I was fully grown now. I lived in the old alley that had once belonged to my parents. One day I found a round rock. It was a perfect toy, so I played with it for a while. Then I threw it into the road by accident. I ran into the street to get it, but little did I realize what danger I had put myself in. I noticed the car coming, but it was already too late. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I woke up in the Neopian hospital. I had no idea where I was, though. For some reason, I couldn't see through my right eye, either. I jumped down from my bed. I started to walk, but then heard this sound, like gears moving, right underneath me. I stopped walking, and the sound stopped. I moved my ears around, and I heard the sound again, only this time it seemed to be coming from above me. I noticed a mirror, so I walked over to it to look at myself. I gasped. Something was definatly wrong!!! <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I had a metal ear! It was on my right side. I also had a metal leg, also on my right side, the same side that the car had hit me. I also found out why I couldn't see with my right eye. There was a metal covering on it!!! My back right leg was metal from the knee down. It felt strange when I walked, so much so that I had to learn how to do it all over again! I limped out of the Neohospital, and went back to the alley that I used to live in. When I got there, I collapsed, egsausted. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It was early morning, still cold. My tail wrapped around my nose, I dreamt about humans and how I hated them. Just then, I felt myself being picked up. A yound girl had lifted me off the ground. She looked at me. I looked at her. I was tempted to bite her, but I felt warm and safe in her hold. Instead, I tilted my head to the right a little bit, just to look cute. She took me home. Without realizing it, I had made a friend. I have been with ___silver_flame___ every since. She doesn't try too help me walk, or give me any kind of special attention. She understands that I don't want to be helped.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Well, that's the story of Xaudiur, I hope I didn't bore you too much with my litle tale.<br>
