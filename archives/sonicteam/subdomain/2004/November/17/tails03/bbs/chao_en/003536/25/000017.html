Get in line. I hear that every day here. But let me ask this: Why should I be nice to them? I know things from past observance. They don't learn. Even if you're nice they still continue to be assholes. So why bother? It's just a waste of time. Almost as much of a waste as coming here to try to kick them out. I don't hate newcomers, just idiots. They suck out the little iota of life this board has left in it. People have asked them to stop repeatedly, and gave them plenty of chances to do so, but no, the idiots just don't learn. They advertise their stupid websites, abuse this board like a chat room, and send it to hell with their lack of intelligence. The reason the smart, mature people left is because they were so sick of the idiots here. Some of our best members left because of idiots, and they just don't learn their limits. The only thing that can save this board is a Sonic Team administrator, or at least someone with administrative access. The point is:<br>
1) I don't care if I'm banned somehow, this place is overidden with idiots anyway.<br>
2) I gave those idiots so many chances to stop spamming and change things, yet they continue to ignore my advice and keep doing so. It's gotten to the point where I'm fed up, and just won't have them have a good experience here anymore.<br>
