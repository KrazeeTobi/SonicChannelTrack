when my little sister was opening a present from my aunt on the 22nd, (we were allowed to)and it was mario kart double dash. (hence how i got the name.) even though i already have it this one had the demo disc. which i read on a mario games site and it told u what was on there on of the things was sonic heroes. obviously it was my first choice i played. even though tails' voice has changed to even more how u say high pitched? any way for game informer i woould give it a 10.5.  this game is worth the time to play even if the levels are about 12-13 or longer or shorter. (i only played two levels but it was fun but challenging.)  may need some asprin! :)  and rouge is even more extremely sexy than ever!!!!!  to look at her kick ass beauty just be any one except rouge abd press c stick up but don't move just move the c stick trust me she is one beauty to look at   she should be on playboy
