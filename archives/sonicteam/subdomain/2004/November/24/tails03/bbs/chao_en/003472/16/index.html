I have been with my girlfriend for a little over a year, and have been having a great time.<br>
<br>
A few months ago she started throwing up in the morning and just been and all around not fun person to be around. Her boobs hurt all the time, she was tired, all that jazz. Well we got an EPT and it turned out she was in fact pregnant. Big SUPRISE right?<br>
<br>
I took this as wonderful news. I was happy, and excited for the new addition to our relationship. Things pregressed well at first. We were both going through all the motions, buying clothes, and all that stuff, it seemed to be going well. She was happy, but always seemed a bit reserved.<br>
<br>
Everything seemed to be going well to me, but I guess im blind or stupid. My girlfriend was getting more and more unresponsive to any kind of contact. She would sit in the living room crying for hours at a time. It was tearing us apart.<br>
<br>
I kinda figured something was wrong, so I buckled down and talked to her. We talked all night and she explained to me that she didn't want to have the baby. Nothing I could say would make her change her mind. She said &quot;im not having this baby, I can't have this baby.&quot;<br>
<br>
She wanted an abortion.<br>
<br>
Well we fought about it for a week or so. At this point she was already starting to show and was just miserable to be around. Everytime I tried to talk to her she would say things like &quot;Why don't you fuck me in the ass and make another baby to go along with this one!&quot;, she was angry I know it does not make any sense.<br>
<br>
Well now I sorta got the picture. So I caved and told her I would not mind if she got an abortion if she felt that strongly about it, &quot;Being the good person that I fell in love with I knew you would come around.&quot; She said. Heres where things GO really bad.<br>
<br>
We went to the clinic and he informed us that the baby was to far along to be aborted by state law and that there was nothing left to do but have it. My girlfriend was literally DESTROYED. She cried for the rest of the day. That night at home she started drinking, HEAVILY. I tried to disuade her. But after getting beer bottles and plates thrown at me I left the house. I told her that she had lied to me when she had said that she loved me and made love to me. She look me in the eyes and said &quot;Lied? I remember you saying you loved and to cherished me; I don't feel loved or cherished.&quot; This hurt deeply.<br>
<br>
When I got home the next morning, she was passed out on the living room floor in a puddle of urine. After seeing her like this I was crushed, I woke her up and told her that I loved her and that there had to be some way to work this out. She looked me dead in the eye and said, &quot;To get this done right you are going to have to push me down the stairs..Im too scared to do it to myself..&quot; and then started crying. I was stunned.<br>
<br>
The next few hours absolute were hell, we tried everything to get her to miscarry. The first few trips down the stairs she kept grabbing the railing and stopping her self. I finally got fed up and just threw her down the stairs. She hit the bottom in a crumpled heap crying. We waited a few minutes she said she felt fine. She then stood up walked into the kitchen. I heard some noise and then a loud BANG! I rushed into the kitchen and it turned out she had run and hard as she could, stomach first into the counter. She was lying there in a daze crying again. After an hour or so she recoverd and had a NASTY bruise across her belly, but no miscarrige.<br>
<br>
This brings us to today. She kept saying, punch my in the stomach and hard as you can. I refused at first, but after three hours of some one begging you to sock em in the gut your mind changes pretty easy.<br>
<br>
I wailed her in the belly as hard as I could with a decently placed uppercut. She staggered and then fell on her ass winded. She just sat there smiling, then made a strange face and puked all over the floor...and then she exploded and a piano fell on her head.<br>
<br>
She just locked her self in the bathroom, and has been in there for the past hour. I tried to get her to let me in but she won't. Help?

One, have all the beer and stuff that can harm the baby thrown away or hidden. Then go to a hypnotist with your g/f. If your g/f gets angry with you or refuses to go, get a hypnotist to come to your apartment (make sure everything harmful is put away, so she can't hurt anyone. Such as knifes, forks, and other household items that are dagerous). Ask the hypnotist to put her under a trance that will make her excited about having the baby and that also makes her stop drinking, because that can make a birth defect. You also might want to erase her memory of being upset about it, then tell her 2 years later. Make sure she doesn't bonk her head or anything that will break the trance. I've seen people who have had hypnosis treatment for drinking and smoking. It really works. Mabye that will help. If not, I'll try to think of something else...
