&gt; Amy was sitting on the front porch of her house. &quot;When will Sonic ever like me as much as I like him?&quot; Amy said sadly. &quot;Well, you can sit him down and explain to him,&quot; someone said as it approached Amy. &quot;Tikal? Is that you?&quot; Amy said. &quot;Yep! It's me! Long time no see Amy!&quot; Tikal said. &quot;Wow! I can't believe you're actually here!&quot; Amy said happily. &quot;So. Where's Sonic?&quot; Tikal asked. &quot;(Sigh) He's on another journey somewhere.&quot; Amy said. &quot;Well, I have to go now. I just came here to say hi to you.&quot; Tikal said. &quot;Ok. Bye Tikal.&quot; Amy said. &quot;Bye. Hope you accomplish your dream,&quot; Tikal said and left. &quot;I'm gonna take a walk aroung Station Square now. That's the only thing to do here. It's so boring.&quot; Amy said. As Amy was near the Burger Shop, she saw Sonic walking around. &quot;It's Sonic! He came back! Oh Sonic!&quot; Amy said running after him. &quot;Huh? A-A-A-Amy?&quot; Sonic said in shock. &quot;Hi! Long time no see Sonic!&quot; Amy said. &quot;Uhhh, yea. Long time no see.&quot; Sonic said nervously. &quot;I want to ask you something. Wanna go on a walk with me? Please?&quot; Amy said. &quot;Ummm...&quot; Sonic said thinking. &quot;Well, it's not like a date Sonic!&quot; Amy said. &quot;(Sigh)Ok Amy,&quot; Sonic said.<br>
