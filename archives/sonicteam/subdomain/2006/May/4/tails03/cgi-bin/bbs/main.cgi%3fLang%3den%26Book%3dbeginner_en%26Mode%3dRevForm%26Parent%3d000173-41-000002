Make it dark and give it running animals and green Chaos drives.

So to answer your question, you need to give it a certain type of animals/chaos drives and make it neutral, hero or dark to find the one you want.
Here is a part of guide from  NMcNair:

NEUTRAL:

     Note:  It would seem that Sonic Team has left the neutral evolution
     patterns the same as the first game.

     Normal/Running   :  Top of Chao's head grow longer and pointy.

          Normal/Swimming  :  The top of the chao's head becomes thinner
     and curves forward more, it resembles a thorn almost.

     Normal/Power     :  Chao Spike splits slightly, typical of horns,
     only smaller.

     Normal/Flying    :  The tip of the chao's head curls up.

     Running/Running  :  Sonic Chao.  This chao is the sonic chao,
     and is a fun chao to show to your friends.

     Running/Swimming :  The chao will turn aqua and will become elongated
     and have a very aerodynamic look.

     Running/Power    :  The Chao's spikes will turn upward
     and he will get huge fists.

     Running/Flying   :  The Spikes on the head and end of the toes curl up.

     Swimming/Swimming:  The head and body become streamlined and the
     ears become huge and hang down, all the way to the ground.

     Swimming/Running :  The head will shorten and the chao will
     turn greener than it had been.

     Swimming/Power   :  This Chao is fat.  It is a huge chao and
     looks like it would fit into the infamous Weird AL video.

     Swimming/Flying  :  The head curl upward, like a regular chao, but
     is a much darker color.

     Power/Power      :  Retains the shape of the normal power chao,
     but turns a very dark red.

     Power/Running    :  Spike curls down, similar to sonic chao.

     Power/Swimming   :  The head becomes very long, and resembles
     the rocketeer (if anyone remembers the rocketeer).

     Power/Flying     :  This is the coolest chao in the game, it
     gets Knuckles like fists, and the head curls up and down, trust me,
     it is worth it.

     Flying/Flying    :  This is the NiGHTS chao.  It looks just like
     NiGHTS from Sonic Team's great game.

     Flying/Running   :  The spikes curl around much like a rams
     horns, it also turns a deeper pink.

     Flying/Power     :  Turns red and the spikes turn upward at a
     steep angle.

     Flying/Swimming  :  This is my second favorite chao in the game,
     it becomes very elongated and arms become very wing like,
     this is a great chao.


HERO:

     Hero/Normal/Running   :  antenna elongate.

     Hero/Normal/Swimming  :  Not sure just yet, if you have one
     and can send a picture, please do so, or a description and I
     will post it and give you credit.

     Hero/Normal/Power     :  Not sure just yet, if you have one
     and can send a picture, please do so, or a description and I
     will post it and give you credit.

     Hero/Normal/Flying    :  Not sure just yet, if you have one
     and can send a picture, please do so, or a description and I
     will post it and give you credit.

     Hero/Running/Running  :  The Antenna splits into three at the end,
     Retains the coloration, and the antenna keeps the spiked look
     It initially had.

     Hero/Running/Swimming :  he still has the spike, but 2 spikes pop
     Out and bends down at a 45 degree angle. the spikes' colors are
     blue, yellow, blue, yellow ect. the belly's blue part turns
     smaller and it has a yellow border.

     Hero/Running/Power    :  The single antenna spike becomes much
     Larger and the chao takes on a purple coloration.

     Hero/Running/Flying   :   Tail and Head Spike split into two towards
     the end of both, and become more rounded and less spike like
     , the blue/white alternating colors change to a blue/purple
     pattern, pretty cool chao.

     Hero/Swimming/Swimming:  The antenna become longer.

And there's more.</TEXTAREA></TD>
