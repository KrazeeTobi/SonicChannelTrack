            The new action video game that will not only shock your fingertips 

            -- but also shock you out of your senses!<br>

            Calling (shooting) and Responsing (destroying) enemy viruses will 

            steadily create phrases of music which will lead the player into a 

            dreamlike world of sound and sense. As the player concentrates harder 

            and harder on the game, random sound effects will turn into a steady 

            rhythm, while waves of lights and colors will consume the player entirely. 

            And when sound and visual effects ultimately come together, Rez will 

            open your senses to a totally unbelievable experience like nothing 

            you have ever felt before.<br>

          <td class="text01" colspan="3"><span class="text01">Playing Rez is very 

            simple. Just lock on the attacking viruses and destroy them. Conquer 

            each level as they appear before you, and new stages will keep opening 

            ahead -- taking you deeper and deeper into the dramatic world of Rez. 

            There is no need for special talent in music or action. All you have 

            to do is play the game, and when you start feeling the beat rise inside 

            you, music and rhythm will already be dancing around your senses with 

            breathtaking reality.<br>

            </span>The music you &quot;create&quot; will be released from the 

            DUAL SHOCK controller of Play Station 2 as vibrations that run through 

            both your body and soul. The vibrations when synchronized with the 

            music and visual effects will give you an experience like none ever 

            before. If you are able to play with the Trance Vibrator (sold separately) 

            connected to the Play Station 2, the vibrations will be even more 

            extreme! The impact of sound, visual effects and vibrations all coming 

            together at you at the same time is so indescribably great that there 

            is no way to explain it but experience it yourself!<br>

            just want to instantly experience the magic of sound, light and vibration, 

            the game mode &quot;Easy Rez&quot; is perfect. When playing this game 

            mode, you are invincible against the virus enemies which allows you 

            to concentrate on enjoying the world of Rez. Easy Rez is also great 

            for practicing Rez. And the more you play Rez, the more stages and
