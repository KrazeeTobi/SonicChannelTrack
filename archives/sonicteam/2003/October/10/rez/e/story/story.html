                    A computer network so large that nothing can control it.<br>

                    A system overloaded with network crimes floating in the blink 

                    of corruption<br>

                    <br>

                    With the introduction of the new central processor &quot;Project-K&quot;, 

                    and the birth of &quot;Eden&quot;, the system finally seemed 

                    to start moving toward completion.<br>

                    But during procession of the almost eternal amount of information 

                    lying within the network, Eden starts to doubt the very existence 

                    of itself and it's purpose, finally dropping into a unwakable 

                    sleeping state because of the many paradoxes that exist within 

                    the human world.<br>

                    The player sets out on a journey to find &quot;Eden&quot; 

                    hiding somewhere in the visualized cyberworld created by the 

                    network. The cyberworld continually changes its form as it 

                    is hacked over and over again by outside forces.<br>

                    Will you be able to destroy all firewalls infected by the 

                    computer viruses and wake &quot;Eden&quot; from its long sleep?</p>
