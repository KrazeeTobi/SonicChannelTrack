                  there Space Cats, the sequel to Space Channel 5 has landed. 
                  The Ulala phenomenon is back courtesy of Sega's SONICTEAM, under 
                  the watchful eye of creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi.<br>
                  <br>
                  It's the 25th century. Several lunar cycles have passed since 
                  Ulala saved the human kind and repelled the Morolian invasion 
                  against Earth through dance. Life is quite too quiet for Ulala 
                  until Chief Director 'Space Michael' reports that a mysterious 
                  dancing group is forcing innocent bystanders to dance and then 
                  whisking them away... Here starts another swinging report show 
                  from Ulala!<br>
                  <br>
                  Our intergalactic anchor girl must take part in 'Rhythm Battles,' 
                  where she takes control of a musical instrument and plays in 
                  sync with her opponents, and also in 'Lyrics Battle,' where 
                  Ulala gives her singing voice a workout in order to defeat the 
                  foes that await her.<br>
                  A TV channel is only good if it retains high ratings, and that's 
                  ditto for Space Channel 5. Ulala must keep the viewer rating 
                  high; failure to do so will lead to the show's cancellation 
                  - Space Michael is counting on you!<br>
                  Space Channel 5 Part 2 has a deeper storyline and dynamic new 
                  features that are sure to entice the fans of the original title. 
                  The fully rendered background graphics in this sequel was made 
                  possible by the cutting-edge technology of the PlayStation2 
                  Emotion Engine, with its real-time camera feature allowing more 
                  dramatic camera action and on-screen effects.<br>
                  If you want to perfect the art of cooperation with your friend, 
                  select the two-player mode. With one controlling the directional 
                  buttons and another the 'Hey' and 'Chu' buttons, zapping those 
                  Morolians becomes a zip. If you've become confident enough with 
                  your dancing skills, try the dance-off mode where Ulala and 
                  the Morolians must 'out dance' eachother!<br>
                  Items and costumes obtained in the main game mode and Ulala 
                  Dance mode can be viewed and selected for use in the Costume 
                  Room. As was in the first game of the series, the character 
                  profile book displays all the hostages you've rescued throughout 
                  the game and their profiles in detail. Above their profile the 
                  rescued hostages give out clues on where to get items and where 
                  the hidden input points may be, so check it closely.<br>

                  your groove on has never been so fun! Sega of America, Inc. 
                  today announced the release of &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; for 
                  the 128-bit, Internet-ready Sega Dreamcast videogame console.<br>
                  Starring Ulala, an indelible dance diva and space age newscaster, 
                  &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; challenges players to help her out-boogie 
                  alien funksters (aka Morolians) in order to free their human 
                  captives and save the Earth.<br>
                  Developed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, developer of hits including 
                  &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; and &quot;Space Channel 
                  5&quot; heralds an all new style of console gaming.<br>
                  The game is driven by an engaging storyline, groovy techno tunes, 
                  fashionably in vogue characters, and gameplay that players of 
                  all ages and sexes will enjoy.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Set 
                  in the 25th century, the Morolian alien race have attacked and 
                  subdued innocent Earthlings with their dance-inflicting ray 
                  guns.<br>
                  Ulala, an up-and-coming weather girl working at Space Channel 
                  5, is the only one available to free the captives from this 
                  alien dance trance.<br>
                  In order to break the Morolian's hypnotic grasp, Ulala must 
                  mimic the aliens' exact dance moves by keeping the beat with 
                  pauses, quick repeats and moves timed to perfection.<br>
                  However, the storyline has some additional twists and turns 
                  that don't take place on the dance floor, involving a ratings-driven 
                  producer named Fuse and Pudding, a former teen idol turned reporter 
                  for rival Channel 42.<br>
                  With plenty of weight on her shoulders, Ulala is the Earth's 
                  only hope.<br>

                  Rez, the future of interactive shooting game, is an endorphin 
                  machine that releases the essence of trance through cutting-edge 
                  sound and visuals. The player must shoot down the enemies with 
                  a laser, thus releasing the &quot;sound essence&quot; each and 
                  every enemy carries. The more enemies you shoot down the more 
                  &quot;sound essence&quot; you obtain, which intensifies the 
                  sound and the linked visuals; the game's feel dramatically transforms 
                  as you progress to create your original blend of tracks. Give 
                  yourself in to the ecstatic blend of color, form, movement and 
                  sound - all intertwined to make one experience that completely 
                  envelops all senses.<br>
                  Tetsuya Mizuguchi, leader of the project, sums up Rez gameplay: 
                  &quot;Rez is something no one has experienced before. It's more 
                  than just a game; it is the essence of trance but so much more 
                  than what clubs and trance parties can provide.&quot;<br>
                  Set over five levels, each stage featuring exclusive tracks 
                  created by some of the world's most progressive music artists, 
                  the player must track down and wake the central A.I., &quot;Eden,&quot; 
                  by breaking through the firewalls of a super virtual network 
                  with a laser gun. <br>
                  Even in this virtual world, you are not invincible. You must 
                  collect items along the way that will be downloaded onto the 
                  memory system, which allows you to evolve from a humanoid to 
                  a pure energy form.<br>
                  Rez is a true breakthrough, transcending all conventional game 
                  genre. Its groove will completely submerse you in &quot;synaesthesia&quot;; 
                  it is truly the first playable work of art available on PlayStation2.<br>
