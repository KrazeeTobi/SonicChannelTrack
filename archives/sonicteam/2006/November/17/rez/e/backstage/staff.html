            I'm thankful and proud to be one of the members to join the ride all 

            the way from production to promotion of Rez. This game would have 

            never been made if we had even lost one single staff member. It is 

            a software that is a product of a miracle equivalence of talent resulting 

            in an unique chemical reaction. I also have a lot of private episodes 

            concerning the production of Rez, and it has become a very special 

            game for me. I hope a lot of people will be able to play Rez, and 

            I really think they should! Please don't judge it singularly by it's 

            appearance. Play it first and you'll see what I mean!<br>

            I was able to reconfirm to myself that it is always a real hard job 

            to create something for someone. It's almost a miracle when anything 

            is actually finished. Creating something that everyone loves is so 

            unbelievably difficult, that if you just look away for a moment, something 

            slips away from you. Rejection never moves anything forward. Endless 

            approval is what moves things forward. Approving is far more harder 

            than denying something. It was an endless year and a half of getting 

            lost and believing that we will find the correct road again and again. 

            Shaping an abstract image into a worthily product. Finding the road 

            together in the continent of possibilities, and reaching that goal 

            together. There was lots of things that were not perfect but those 

            things alone made my experience in creating Rez a priceless one.<br>

            To the people who chose to experience Rez. Thank you very much. If 

            you are able to truly enjoy this game, that would make me really happy. 

            Thanks to everyone!<br>

            The production of Rez was so challenging and so fun in every aspect 

            of the word. I'll probably never be able to experience this much miracles 

            happen at the same time. I was so lucky to share this experience.

            One day late in the production, I was debugging the game in a half-asleep 

            state and suddenly found myself thinking &quot;I'm so lucky to be 

            in this project&quot;. It was really a casual thought, but I still

            but I tried as hard as I can to achieve the ultimate effects of each 

            sound down to the last flash of every laser beam fired. Dense reverbs, 

            continuos delays, and passionate flangers.　Experience the surge of
