Any use of CTA&rsquo;s IP must be in accordance with the <a href="https://cdn.ces.tech/ces/media/pdfs/terms-ces-logo-name.pdf" target="_blank">CTA Trademark Guidelines</a>.</p>

As IP deals with intangible assets, they can often come under debate at trade shows, where several copyright, trademarks, patents, and industrial design rights are being unveiled for the first time. CTA respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect you to do the same. You must not display post, share, or send any content that violates or infringes someone else&rsquo;s IP rights. The use of another&rsquo;s IP without proper authorization or a legally valid reason may lead to a violation of CTA&rsquo;s policies and these Terms.</p>

<p>You are responsible for the content you post. Any User Content will be considered non-confidential and nonproprietary. You must not post any User Content on or through the Services or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. When you submit User Content through the Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorized by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services, to transmit it from the Services to other third party platforms, and/or adopt any third party content.</p>

<p>You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us, but by submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable, perpetual worldwide license to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorize other users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented. You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your username, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content.</p>

<p>By posting User Content, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you post to or through the Services.</p>

<p>If you have questions about IP law, you may want to contact an attorney.</p>

<p>If you believe that your IP is being infringed upon, you must communicate in writing with the individual/entity responsible to inform them that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You, as the IP Owner, have reason to believe that the exhibitor will/is displaying or using infringing products and/or IP on the Platform or within any Services;</li>
	<li>You are requesting the exhibitor to remove the infringing products and/or IP from virtual display;</li>
	<li>If the exhibitor refuses to remove the infringing products or IP, you may seek a court order.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contacting the user directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and directly in a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may report alleged IP infringement to <a href="mailto:copyright@cta.tech">CTA Legal</a>. If you are unsure whether the material you plan to report to us is infringing, you should first seek legal advice before reporting such content to us. If you submit a report or infringement notification to us, we may contact you if we have additional questions about your report or notification. Failure to share necessary information may limit our ability to investigate your claims and may result in your complaint being denied.</p>

<p>Please note that CTA is not in a position to adjudicate disputes between third parties and may not be able to remove the content or suspend the account you reported. However, CTA reserves the right to remove or suspend any content or account that infringes another&rsquo;s IP. If we do not receive notice that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material at issue, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed if the material does not infringe on third-party IP. The decision to repost any content is at CTA&rsquo;s sole discretion.</p>

<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Before submitting a notification, please be aware that intentionally submitting a misleading or fraudulent report may lead to liability for damages under section 512(f) of the DMCA or similar laws as may be applicable in other countries.</p>
